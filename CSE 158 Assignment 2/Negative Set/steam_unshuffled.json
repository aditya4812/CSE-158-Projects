{"text": "This is a great game, the combination of tower defence and first person shooter is brilliant, I recommend this game to all.If there is anything I had to say was bad about it it is the lack of upgrades to your weapons, bacause as the enemies get stronger, your weapons stay the same, you do get more weapons when you level up, but your primary weapon just doesn't do very well, also as the levels get harder, you can't put more towers down, but that is just part of the fun i rate it 9.5/10"}

{"text": "Very disappointing. Codemasters have taken a grant-bribe from Oculus to buy platform exclusivity. No reason this couldn't have been delivered using open source Steam VR. Codies' PR team are busy fobbing off questions about Vive compatibility with evasive corporatespeak drivel while, presumably, lighting Cuban cigars with dirty $100 notes from the Facebook coffers. What next? Games you can't play with mouse/keyboard control unless you're a Logitech customer? nVidia only software which refuses to run for AMD users? Software which only works on a Samsung monitor (thanks for the brown paper envelope, guys).It sucks, and is of no benefit to the consumer. The PC platform's strength is broad compatibility regardless of who manufactures the components or peripherals. This is the thin end of the wedge, and PC gamers should stand together in giving a well deserved collective middle finger to anyone involved in these shabby practices.Oh, and as far as the review goes, I couldn't play the game in VR because Codemasters were bribed into avoiding the de facto OpenVR standard in favour of locking down the hardware with Oculus' proprietory drivers, so....That's a huge thumbs down and a generous 2 testicles/10 rating for this one. Hope Codemasters choke on Mark Zuckerberg's baby batter..."}

But doesn't burden you for making a mistake or dying, there are no lifes, no health and little frustration. This game takes us back to when games were purely fun, not for the sake of a competitive nature or skillful abilities.I remain playing Fez because it's a massive puzzle game that doesn't (or shouldn't) make you feel frustrated about playing it. Diasterpiece's soundtrack helps to make this game a complete immersive world, one in which has a strong cult following for one reason.It's all in all a very great game to play, complete and complete again."}

{"text": "\"5 STARS! A+! 4 MORE STARS!\" is wah i wish i could say for this game. now dont get me wrong, this game is phenomenal, but there are issues.firstly the good:-the graphics:for an indie game, this game looks awesome! the enemies are varied and unique (most of the time), the particle effects are spot on, and the backdrops are beatiful. i'd put them in a frame if i had a printer.-the music: it is again, very good. a very ambient, but somewhat blood-pumping sci-fi alien (almost metroid like) soundtrack. pretty much my favourite bits would be the guitar riffs in level 1 :)-the Gameplay:solid movement and hit detection. i never over estimate a jump. little to no glitches. and a fool proof way to stop people from farming the same mobs endlessly (that difficulty meter that fills as you spend more time in a stage. GENIUS.)and did i mention mulltiplayer. because that is important. this game is worlds bette rwith multiplayer as you and your frined muck about and get killed. alot.now the bad...-graphics arent everything and in a game where the very asthectic is a simple but appealing 32 bit pixel asthetic, its hard to complain. but in later levels of the game (or just later difficulties)i would continually lose myself in the swarm of mobs and lose a chunk of my health because i couldnt see my tiny-as-an-atom charecter amongst all of these behemoths who were similarly colured, and end up accidentally jumping off a platform.-the difficulty meter/timer is, as i said earlier: genius. but it fills a little too quickly. during the early hours of the game i found myself getting crushed by mobs as they were continually getting stronger at an alarming rate, while i  was struggling to pick them off. if i may present a solution to this problem: allow the player to pick how quickly they want the difficulty meter to filleasy mode might be 8 mins to get from very easy > easy, normal can be the standard time, and hard can be 2-3 minutes between difficulties.------so despite the minor flaws with the game (and me sounding a little pretentious during this review), this game is definiteley worth your time for those who have never tried a rogue-lite game before. the multiplaayer is a great way for you to learn with a friend, and once your done learning, you'll see theres more depth, more challenge, than what you were already presented with (and you already had alot to begin with!)4/5 stars :)"}

I didnt even know it was part of a series to recently. As soon as it went on sale in stea, it was the best decision ever to buy it.Playing the second game first doesnt spoil much. But you will be like \"Ohhhh\" with some places and remember. Which was what happened to me throughout the game.I did love playing this game very much so. Some parts you will get stuck and cannot figure out what to do. But paying close attention to absolutely  everything is the key. I know some might phase out after a while.But I do reccommend you play this in one sitting whilst everything is still fresh in your mind so do not forget places or what you need to do.Always check your diary, It is your best friend.Other than that.

Even though I only played very periodically and didn't feel as if I was enjoying myself too much, in hindsight, I found myself sinking hours into this, hence my over 400 hours of playtime.

{"text": "I'm pretty sure I bought this after getting a 90% off coupon from making a gmod badge. I had a go at it and from what I've found is that it's an ok game for players un-familiar to horror games but not as entertaining for the fans of the genre. I found the game mechanics good and easy to operate and familiarise myself with but ultimately the game lacked in content you could get yourself sucked into and didn't give you the chance to connect to the character Walden mainly due to the lack of voice acting. While I may not think Walden and the Werewolf is one of the best games when it comes to an original story I do think the creators have something going for them and I deffinetly would buy the game again to support them in the hope of future games... For 10 cents anyway."}
{"text": "The Gaben = 10/10"}
{"text": "This game is amazing. Complex at first, the game has a good tutorial that explains the main concepts. The game has lots of layers and multiple ways to win, either through, science, culture, and diplomacy, or war and domination. This enables you to not always crush everyone, but to be diplomatic or be more cultural/scientific. Your social policies can give you edges in certain areas of your Civilization, and often one thing is connected to another. More science research means better army which leads to more diplomatic power and so on. Only negatives are that sometimes the worker automation does not work and that one game can take days to finish. Multiple characters and DLC enable endless replayability without the game becoming boring. Overall, a great game."}

You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll curse, you'll sing with joy. Anything positive I can say about this game will merely be eclipsed by the actual experience if you decide to pick it up.

However I'd recommend buying some of the other commanders instead."}

{"text": "Saints row 4 is a crowning achievement (Better then the third, that's for sure!)PROS-*The super powers really help set this game apart (plus, who doesn't like juming five buildings?)*The writing for the story and characters are out standing, getting (mostly) rid of the stupid dirty joke garbage the third saints row had. The villiam has great writing, I can't press this enough, it's just so good!*THe humor is pretty good, whether you're climbing a nuke, or you're in a 60's sitcom, you'll get a laugh out of this game.*The graphics (on max settings) weren't improved by much, but they still look pretty good.*A bunch of the side mission/activities are extremely fun to play (fraud being my favourite)*optimisation is extremely good in the single player*There's a bunch of gun custimisation, you can make your pistols into robo cops gun!CONS-*Gunplay seems to be just an after thaught in this title, the game kind of expects you to just use your super powers, which is nice and all, but I like scoring 5 headshots in a row with robo cops gun. *While there is alot of gun custimisation, it all seems reduntant once you get super powers, which is a shame because there are some really cool skins for your guns (the pulse rifle, for example)*Just like guns, cars become obselete once you get your super powers, this is made worse by the fact that the new/improved car custimisation system is awesome! Unfortunately, the game basically punishes you for using cars.*Like many people, I believe the game gives you super powers far too early. If they had given them to you perhaps half way through the game, this would help with the redundancy of the cars/guns.*co-op is LAGGY!!!! It's seriously un playable at times, if you want this game for co-op, you have been warned.MIDDLE-*They basically re used the same map from saints 3, and added a few things here and there. I don't really hate that, I mainly just thought \"after you guys decided this would be a full game, couldn't you at least give us a new map to run around in??\"VERDICT--Saints row 4 is a worthy addition to the saints row franchise, it has great humor, addicting gameplay amongst all the other great things about this game. There are a few problems, but they don't really take away from the experience or the fun to be had here. Unfortunately, this is basically the last game in the franchise, I suppose it's good it ended on a good note then!I would definately reccomend this (I don't use a number system because it's flawed)"}

Actually there isn't a single game I have played that long, don't really know what it is but the combat is great, the powers are great and so are the instances. Even though the raids and alerts are always the same they are always fun to do, especially in a fun group. One downside is though that people always look for high CR players, literally if you're 1 below 99 or 100 they won't accept you into the group, the raids and alerts you can do but you wont be allowed to because of your lower Combat Rating.However if you manage to get into a good league you should be all set as they will have members that will be doing the raids with you and will want to help you out."}

{"text": "At first I found this game a bit challenging, but after a bit of getting used to I have found it easier and is one of my favourite games of all time, recently I have been playing heaps and the community is a lot friendlier behind this game aswell, example at the end of a CS:GO game 'gg' at the end of a CoD game 'You fkn suck go to hell'. The game is well made and the continuous content updates are great, a good thing that separates Golbal Offensive from Source is the new guns and the weapon skins for each gun giving you the ability to have cooler looking guns, and more importantly StatTrak which gives players who can afford it the ability to count their kills. The micro-transactions in this game are not forced onto you but it is a good way to gamble, like if you spend $20 on an unboxing and get a $120 knife from it you made profit, or you lose money (that is why it's gambling), and the operations which give you earlier access to community made maps and keep a personal record of your competitive scores. This game is one of the best First Person Shooters out there and I'd give it a 9/10. The EMS competitions give players the chance to try get their name out there in the CS:GO community and also win big cash, and for those who are not a good enough player who can't assemble a team it is great fun to wath."}

{"text": "World of Guns: Gun Disassembly is a really in depth firearm simulator. Mostly in the way you pull apart the guns piece by piece but there is a firing range and operation mode where you can fire the gun of your choice with different attachments such as silencers, scopes, different magazine sizes and just learn how every single component works with each other. The satisfaction you get when you pull apart and put back together a sophisticated gun with more than 60 parts without choosing the wrong components is probably more rewarding than shooting the gun itself. The only downside to this game is that it's a bit grindey, but I guess that adds to the charm of getting to know each and every part of the weapon you are disassembling, but it's not too much of a problem for me as I don't really mind a bit of a grind sesh once in a while. Plus I get time to learn every weapon that is in the game instead of just blazing past every single gun and missing out on how they all work.In conclusion, it's MUCH better than the Google Play and Apple store versions just because of the fact you have full control over the camera. Plus it's a stupidly fun and rewarding game if you're into pulling things apart then putting them back together just to see how they work and operate."}

{"text": "tough, but im going to have to say no to a recommendation.- inconsistant difficulty, mainly due to random nature.- not all concepts translate well to non-touch screens.- music is too damn catchy!- have stopped having fun, but want to press forward just to finish it.Lots of box types, vast majority are useless when facing an obstacle. So many boxes are broken and wasted in between obstacles. Some sections took me 15mins to clear, others took me over 2 hours of gameplay because of the difficulty and slim chances of the planets aligning to make the objective possible to complete."}
{"text": "I didnt really like this game and I quit shortly after trying it out. The look of this game is appealing, but I didnt get what to do as I was randomly talking to people wanting directions. There was no tutorial that tells me what to do or the controls. It wasn't a fun experience for me and I will probably never play it again. Score (from my experience): 2.5/10 (Sorry for the hate)"}

Sometimes after a heist, you may need to hold out survive to escape the rotting cells of jail. Once finishing a heist, you can choose between 3 cards - which you can unlock new masks, weapons, and mods.I strongly recommend this game and is worth every minute of playing. A definite buy."}

{"text": "The only WWI game that flows like the war it is based on, where as others are simply a skin Verdun though game play, environments, weapons and tactics/formations gives that static stuck in the mud feel that really pins the first war.  The maps are also interesting with your typical treeless miles of crater filled mud where only the quick of feet survive , half destroyed fortresses , trenches with players struggling in close quarter combat with pistols, grenades and bayonets, french farm land where men charge and die for a little more than 100 yards of corn only to reach trench on the other side  Not to mention that one reason I like this game is the use of automatic weapons is ether restricted to realistic levels or having disadvantages such as not being able to fire until deployed or having horrid hip fire accuracy.  If your interested in  -History of the great war (western front aka trenches in France) -first person shooters in a take and hold sort of game play -getting shell shock -wearing gas masks -using wacky weapons -having PTSD  your likely have fun with this game  Turn the gore on full you won't thank me for the PTSD but you will for immersion.

The cards that you are dealt can also make you want to uninstall the game, especially when you get dealt dead for 30+ hands. The bots don't know that they're doing, sometimes they flop a house and other times call with air. You cannot predict the bots, and be sure to only all in when you have something higher than two-pair, because this game can screw you up. A letdown in terms of poker, you can't even skip the dialogue; and after a while it just gets so annoying.

{"text": "This game confronts the player with the harsh realities of war. The player plays from the perspective of a group of civilians in a fictional war-torn city, trying all that they can to survive in the difficult circumstances, holding on until 'the end'.There is a mixture of assertive and reactive elements (due to RNG) to this game, there is also a sufficient number of avenues for players to explore within. The 2D layout and the arcade-styled movement within makes it quite engaging.This game does however, suffer from the lack of significant replayability after two to three successful playthroughs.Nonetheless, it provides a poignant reminder of the effects of war, especially relevant to the Present day.

{"text": "I'd like to immediately point out that if you are looking for a way to learn the rules of Magic: The Gathering, and happened to spy this title in the free-to-play section and think to yourself, \"A free way to play Magic that teaches me the rules and is intuitive? Yes please!\", or if you're a veteran Magic player like myself and saw this thinking, \"Oh boy, Wizard's released their new DotP game! I hope it's just like DotP201X and a far better improvement on DotP2015\", then steer clear; you will be sorely disappointed at Wizard's newest \"game\" in the series.Let me highlight the good point first and give credit where credit is due.A deckbuilding system that is fairly lenient and pretty creative. Yes we had this in 2015 and it was one of the only good things from that game.A storyline that is somewhat fun and interesting to follow. Though the cinematics were a bit lackluster and can't hold a candle to Warcraft III cinematics from 2002, the lore following each planeswalker is a nice touch to add backstory. Then again you can look it all up on the internet, so that doesn't count for much.Origins Cards and Planeswalkers. For God knows how long people have wanted planeswalkers in these games and we finally have them. Also a mixture of Origins and non-standard cards makes for some interesting decks, if you have the time to unlock them.Enjoy that little list of good stuff? Alright. Now let's bust some balls.Buggy interface and connectivity issues. This was inevitable. All DotP games have had some form of interface problem or online connectivity issue. Most usually get patched out fairly quickly. But needing to consistently reconnect to save coin progress? Enchanted creatures not displaying correctly after zooming? Spells and abilities mistargeting? Players disconnecting mid-game or having games hang? You'd be better playing MTGO.Deck construction limitation. This garbage again. 4 commons, 3 uncommons, 2 rares, 1 mythic. An attempt at balancing deck construction, but ultimately restricting our creativity with decks. I'd much rather have DotP2014's system of unlocking cards for specific decks, and have other decks as DLC packs.Archetype Quests. Apparently decks don't identify as a two-colour deck unless you use their deck building \"Wizard\". In short, you pick a card out of 5 shown to you. It then uses the cards you've picked to suggest other cards, place them in front of you, and you pick one. Not only does it feel like you're building decks in Hearthstone, these decks are horrendously underpowered in comparison to what a person with basic deckbuilding skill can create in the full deck builder. ~But you can't earn coins from quests unless you use the deck wizard~Coins and Boosters. DotP2014 had you pay to play Sealed, but that was fairly cheap and you got 6x 15 card packs. DotP2015 Had you unlock cards through campaigns on specific planes, but they were 15 card packs, and there was an option of some premium cards. What does this give you? 6 cards per pack, at $2 per pack Yep, if you don't want to play God knows how many games to save up 150 coins to buy 1x 6 card pack, you can pay $2 to get 150 coins to buy that pack. So it now becomes 3x slower than normal just to unlock the commons for my deck. And if I'm building a particular colour and the pack has nothing good for that colour? Oh well! Try playing more duels and saving more coins for another pack! Or buy coins to get the cards faster!This game is a disaster. There are just so many issues with it; so many things that should not be. Had they just made a $15 game like in the past with pre-built decks and unlockable card pools for them, maybe everything would've been fine. DotP is supposed to be a fun way to introduce players to the game with interesting decks, and chaotic matches combined with unique game modes like Archenemy and Planechase. This is just a money grab, and a poor attempt at it. You shouldn't be paying for a collection of cards like this unless they're physical or on MTGO. If you're looking for a DotP game that is serious fun, I would lean towards DotP2012, 2013, or 2014. This doesn't deserve our time or attention."}

{"text": "Borderlands 2 is pretty much Borderlands 1  with new map with some player and enemy changes. Whilst fun it was also a little boring, especially if you play it directly after playing Borderlands which is a better game.What was disappointing was the missing customisable weapons mechanic which was promised prior to release but never delivered (I suppose it will be an extra charge as DLC).Seeing as it only really a map and character addon to Borderland, it might have been better to be able to extend gameplay from Borderlands into Borderlands 2 but the way the converted Borderlands players to be NPCs in Borderlands 2 made that impossible.Overall not much different that Borderlands, simply not as good as they wanted to nickle and dime players with DLC that is obviously content missing from the game, if a lot of the DLC had been in the game rather than charged extra for, the game would be as good as the orginal but honestly if you have Borderlands dont bother with Borderlands 2 as it is not as good.

{"text": "Terrible game, they take a server down without telling anyone for the whole day making it so you cannot access your characters. Then when the server finally comes back on i go to log in, the launcher loads and then asks me to log in (it usually auto logs me in through steam but this time it didnt), so i enter my details in and get an error saying i cannot log in. so i google what the problem was and it told me that i have apparently broken some rule or am in a country that the game is banned in (which neither of them are true). So i try to play the game again later, after leaving it for a while, i log in, it works, it goes to character select, i choose my character and click \"enter world\". It goes to the loading screen and when it reaches 100% the screen goes black, the window closes and it gives me some stupid reason, trying to explain why the game crashed..... so i kept trying to open the game and it kept doing the same crash. 10/10 waste of time to get the game DO NOT get this worthless crap."}

{"text": "Holy S*** I don't even know where to start reviewing this game. I don't even know if I recommend it or not at this point.Coming from someone who has a decent amount of experience with Unity (The engine this game was made with) I can tell you the developers spent maybe two weeks at most making this. I'm 99% sure the only real work that went into this was the small amount of coding it took to program the movement and weapons (which still isn't even well done). Everything else has either been bought from the unity asset store or downloaded for free. I really can't tell if it's laziness or straight up incompetence but almost no effort has gone into polishing the game. It's the little details that no one normally notices that makes literally all the difference, such as: The gun not rendering over the pause menu. Having more than one 30 second song for the entire game. All the menu fonts being the same size. Somewhat decent audio mixing.  Gun models facing the right direction. Clear and concise UI design. The day/night cycle not being an instant change. I could keep going for hours...But by far the biggest issue with this game is its mechanic design. It feels as though the devs never once stopped to think about how the game feels to a potential player or what would make the game more interesting. absolutly no research into the design of other games and what makes them succesfull was done and no time was taken to ensure the game was engaging. It all comes back to the devs spending nowhere near enough time in development. \"Oh man I'm getting pretty bored of making this game\" \"ehhh, it's technically a finished product. let's just dump it on Steam, make our money back and do something else\"There are so many issues that are basic game design 101 it's physically painful to try and list them all. There is zero context as to who you are or why there are zombies everywhere.  When one level ends you are (without warning or context) teleported to the next level. Every level is exactly the same with a different map. The \"Boss fights\" are so bad I can't even describe them. You start with nowhere near enough ammo.  Zombies just randomly spawn around the map, sometimes in plain sight of the player. The minimap doesn't rotate with the player making it impossible to tell where enemies are coming from. Every level is 15 minutes even though they have maybe 2 minutes at most of content.  The progression and unlock system is useless. Nothing you unlock gives you a feeling of progress as every gun functions basically identically. I got enough money in three levels to unlock every character and weapon in the entire game. As I said before the UI looks like complete garbage and is extremely confusing. I swear everytime I play the FOV gets smaller to a point where I can barely even play. Because of its spaghetti code, the game struggles to maintain 30 FPS (despite looking terrible) on my upper middle level rig that can run most modern games on high at above 60. etc..However this, like all terrible games, has a few positives that makes it almost (key word almost) worth the time and money you waste on it. I recommend you and a bunch friends buy this game when it's on sale just to laugh at and to have a good time. I'm not gonna lie though, I did have a little bit of fun while playing it. And to Digital Homicide (even though you most likey wont read this). I understand that you have a dream of being a respected game developer and it hurts when people harshly criticise or even attack you for your work, but everything people say about you and your games, for the most part, is true. And until you start taking your time and making games that people accually want to play, you will get endless amounts of s*** and trust me, suing big youtubers who give you a negative review will never improve your image. To do that you need to show your worthy of a good image instead of trying to buy your way there."}

When you get into a game it is worth it.Team balancing can sometimes be terrible with a very skilled team on one side and near newbies on the other.Best played with friends because I think you could imagine what chaos ensues if the people aboard a flying dinghy had no coordination.I would like to see grapples or zipwires in the game so we can board other people's ships and start whacking their balloon out of the sky."}

{"text": "I recently started and finished The Vanishing of Ethan Carter in a single sitting, and was thoroughly impressed the entire 4.2 hours it took me to fully complete the game.Although very short (and possibly too short for the full price of the game), TVoEC offers a simplistic yet incredibly engaging game. Taking inspiration from early 20th century weird fiction (namely H.P. Lovecraft, as expected), the story revolves around a private eye on a mission in an isolated village to help one \"Ethan Carter\". While playing through the opening segment, it seemed quite similar to Dark Corners of the Earth (also available on Steam, but broken as all hell) - being dumped in a disturbing setting with next to no guidance, only to figure everything out for yourself. This minimalist style of gameplay definitely works in the game's favour, as it seems to allow for a more immersive experience. There is no HUD, health bars, maps or quest icons. You have the WASD keys, the mouse, and your own two feet.Gameplay revolves around solving various puzzles, and entering the minds of those deceased to see memories shortly before their deaths. It feels slightly cliche, but isn't too over-the-top like you might expect. The game's story is unravelled through these various puzzle sequences, as you explore the village in which the game is set, learning of the characters and their relationships with one another. It's definitely not an in-depth story, but it is very engaging.Where TVoEC really shines is in its atmosphere. From the very first minute of the game, the atmosphere of this game almost smacks you in the face with how incredibly immersive it is. The stunning environments, beautifully-composed soundtrack and occasional narration from the main character provide an incredible feeling of isolation as you make your way through an empty and run-down village. It's almost unlike any game I've ever played, and has to be played to fully understand.I picked the game up off the Humble Store for $6.66 (coincidence?) and felt very satisfied with my purchase. For the RRP of $19.99 it may seem like a bit much for a game that can be finished in a few hours, but for anything ~$10 or less it's definitely a must-have for fans of mystery, horror, and weird fiction."}

{"text": "\"This game is a sleeping hit\". (More in-depth review through the whole post)pros:+Story - great story, great ending.+Gameplay - even tho it gets sturdy, and there aren't many combos you can do, it's still when time comes a fun aspect of the game+graphics cons:-voiceacting - was pretty bad, mediocre at best if you want it-explosion effects-camera - sometimes, it can really annoy you how when you're fighting a boss, it focuses and switches you from one place to the otherIt starts of really fast, and you kinda bump into a story. There's no background, there's nothing until you progress a bit through the game. Even then, you will ask yourself few questions, like, how did I get here where I am, what actually happend, but, even those \"loop-holes\" that exist in the story are minority, and should be ignored. The game picks it up once you go past the first chapter, the combat evolves, and you feel more connection to the characters. For me personaly, the way it was produced, I didn't feel special bond between main character, nor the girl that was with you all the time. Story is something definitely memorable, and if nothing, you should check the game only for that. Gameplay and graphics are something that are also mediocre I would say. Levels are linear, so there's nothing really to add up to it. Gameplay gets robust after a while, but what's interesting in this game is that there isn't that much of a combat as I thought it would be. There are few puzzles here and there, but that's pretty much it. Graphics are also for a game that came out in 2013 I would say pretty solid. Nothing spectacular, effects when popping up the mechs aren't fabulous, but that doesn't stop this game to excell at what it's best."}

A lot of depth, fun combat, great world to explore, clever monster mechanics and a continually expanding endgame makes this seemingly basic concept incredibly deep and will give you hours of fun with your friends (if you can figure out how to set up a stable server).

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

I constantly feel like I am lagging, though I don't think I am, it just isn't very smooth. And it takes time to do everything. Suck up a stone, takes time. Sucking up mushrooms, takes time. Crafting items takes about 30 seconds per item. So you need 8 slabs? yeah, thats a few minutes. There is some standing around waiting time. And to adress the elephant in the room, yes. It IS very similar to minecraft. So similar that I'm surprised they've gotten away with it to be honest! I also doubt there will be much of a modding community. It also feels like its aimed at younger people too, which I don't feel with minecraft. Positives: It runs on my late 2009 iMac. Its fun. Despite the similarity, it does have some differences to Minecraft. Instead of using a pick you use a wrist gadget that \"sucks\" the resources out of the ground. Your character is a regular looking person, cartoonish - not blocky. (The boy reminds me of Ben 10.) The graphics are \"better\" in that they are polished and cartoonish. (I still love Minecraft's graphics though!) And aside from the stone/wood not everything is blocky. The creatures are rounded and like cute little animals. There are some pretty cool skeletons that look like warthogs. Definitely a game to try. Its free so what do you have to lose? Just keep in mind the Freemium and the bugs. "}

Don't expect any combat, tricky puzzles, multiplayer or even voice acting, but expect a detailed narrative that keeps your mind ticking well after the credits have rolled."}
{"text": "Oh my god, where the hell do i start...This game is amazingly funny. You can not go though the game without having a small laugh about the refrences to multiple things like, the KKK, items from past episodes of South Park, Skyrim and pokemon. You can go though the small little town as your own little character, with funny clothing and weapons. If you want to be an abortion doctor, you can! If you want to be Robin Hood, you can! The amount of creativity is astonashing (wish i could say the same about No Man's Sky) You are the chosen one, the new kid that chooses sides during the battle for the stick of truth, siding with all your favourite characters with budders, kyle, stan, cartman and princess kenny! If i must rate this, it would be a huge fat sloppy slap of 10/10! Hyped of \"South Park: The Fractured, but whole\" game coming soon ;)"}

{"text": "The dark atmosphere, and art direction make this a great game, along with some brilliant writing. Unfortunatley stopping this game from being truly great is the combat, which feels clunky and repetetive, however the game is saved by these sequences being relatively sparse.It's puzzles are brilliantly designed, if a little bit obtuse, however this was rarely a problem.Overall the game is held down by it's combat and incredibly short length, and I was left wondering if maybe it wouldn't have been a better use of time creating a longer episode rather than releasing it in it's current length. However, it's puzzles, acting, design and incredible writing make this game a definite must play."}

It is really a one of a kind type of game because you cannot find any games similiar to DW because DW is more of an open game mode where you can move everywhere and do pretty much anything you want compared to Total War where you actually hve space restrictions and the atmostphere is not top-notch.

While the upgrade path is leaning towards pay-to-play, it is not impossible to unlock everything with just game time, but expect to put a load of hours in.

The artwork isn't realistic, but the devs aren't aiming for that.  The characters are given an animated, \"cartoon-y\" sort of appearance, and that fits great with the rest of the environment.  The music is perfect for the game as well.  Be warned: it's not a survival game, and it's not an open-world game.  You are given a very limited number of choices to make, which all ultimately seem to lead to the same ending (trying to avoid spoilers here).

This game has changed my opinion.Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons has such a beautiful art style, like Fable: that realistic yet slightly cartoony look. The game is filled with an array of warm colours, gorgeous lighting and an absolutely HUGE sense of scale. Playing as the two brothers in such a lonely yet amazing set of environments, you feel absolutely dwarfed by the sheer scale of it all. This is saying a lot - but I'm going as far as to say this visually looks more impressive than Okami, which if you've played you'll know is one of the best looking games despite its age.Coupled with a superb, chilling soundtrack and a completely unique single-player co-op gameplay style; this is seriously the perfect game. Two hours in and I swear this is game of the year material, if not one of the best games I've ever played if it continues the way it's started.This had better win a multitude of indie game awards.

{"text": "Great game, lots of fun. Recommend when you first start you concentrate on leveling up good guys. You may get the opportunity to get Daken (Wolverines son) and a couple other of the Dark Avengers, but i wouldn't invest too much iso on them at the start. Most of your early boss battles will be against Dark Avengers, so you'll find your best heroes aren't available in major fights if you've leveled up Dark Avengers.If you're going to spend some cash recommend utilising the daily deals and concentrating on the 2 star and up good guys for leveling.Whilst leveling up 1 star Storm, Iron Man and Black Widow might seem a good decision at the start, if you're planning to play long term I wouldn't wate too much iso on them. They're level capped to 50 (from memory) and are quickly outgunned by the 2, 3 and 4 star heroes."}

It's a lot of fun in my opinion, although the story aspect of it doesn't really go anywhere.It did however endear me to the playable characters, I would actually love it they appeared again in resident evil canon, they are quirky if a bit sadistic and apathetic. That also goes for the spec op team as well, I found them to be quite likeable. It's the little in-game dialogue that really endears them to me.I've finished both the original and spec ops story lines and am still playing this game, the only pity is the fact that the online multiplayer is quite dead and unless you have a lot of friends with this game won't be able to enjoy."}
{"text": "This is a fun game that I enjoy playing, as you can see with my hours. It has a good story, characters and enemies. This is a good game to play with friends, the more friends you have playing the game with you, the harder the enemies are and the better loot you get. It has thousands of weapons and grenade mods, that you can choose from as you get further into the game. This game is about 30 hours long to complete the story if you are just wondering around, searching every area for epic loot. Overall, this game is great to play with friends, and has HEAPS of EPIC LOOT in every area."}

{"text": "Revision - Since the start of development, Overkill has repeatedly stated that they would not introduce micro-transactions to the game. Well guess what! They have! The micro-transaction skins also give a stat boost, giving an unfair advantage to players that pay.Upon Payday: the heist's release it was hailed as one the best cooperative shooters/games in recent memory. The tight controls, intense firefights, brilliant music, interesting objectives and exciting teamplay all contributed to Payday's warm reception. Payday 2 Takes everything the first game did, throws it in a mulcher and uses said mulch to top its own list commendations with even more refined, badass action. Payday 2 Expands on everything the first Payday did right. Gunplay, maps/objectives, customisation, controls and music are all revamped for Payday 2 and with a large progression system, Payday 2 can make for hours of fun. My Score:If you liked Payday: The Heist, Buy this immediately.If you think you might like Payday 2, Buy this immediately.8/10 Pretty Damn good."}

{"text": "Good game, good end to the series.STORY:Pros:- Good story, good escalation, good ending- Actually follows up on Arkham City and Asylum- There are a number of twists and turns in the story, even if someone has spoiled the identity of the Arkham Knight for you, there's still enough awesome twists to make the plot worth playing throughCons:- Because the plot of the story directly follows Asylum and City, it still has a focus on the dead Joker ( which may be disappointing to those expecting that he not be featured very prominently )- The main campaign ( specifically, the \"City of Fear\" missions ) has a much better build-up and ending than the 100% secret ending ( which I had to look for comments on YouTube to explain just what the hell I watched )- The identity of the Arkham Knight is way too heavily foreshadowed, in my opinion. You'll probably figure it out before the revealGAMEPLAY:Pros:- All of the Arkham City gameplay you've come to expect returns with a more refined gameplay experience ( Batman feels more powerful than in City )- Fighting Drones with the Batmobile is fun ( when you get used to it )- Fighting the bigger Drones, that require sneaking around, in the Batmobile feels very reminiscent of the Batman predator sections- Riddler Informants ( that need to be interrogated ) are randomly generated as you just run around the place, meaning there's no more \"Crap, I knocked him out - time to run away, come back and try again\" from Arkham City- A few new gadgets, in addition to the many that returnCons:- Gathering Riddler trophies that involve the Batmobile can be tedious ( as you switch to Batman, progress the puzzle a bit, switch back to the Batmobile, move it and attach the power cable to something else, switch back to Batman and so on. Also, there are trophies that require following question marks along the ground that are revealed with the Batmobiles sonar-thing. These can be tedious as well as you may need to grapple up a section ( which means jumping out of the Batmobile ), or jump over a section of land, and you're not sure where the next question mark is, or if you've lost the trail and need to go back ) or downright frustrating ( one requires you destroy a bunch of riddler question marks in the Batmobile, but to do so you need to use missiles, or you'll run out of time and need to start the puzzle again. The catch? You need to be in combat to build up the meter to use them, meaning if you screw it up and need more energy to use the missiles, then you need to, tediously, drive around beating up bad-guys cars until you gather the minimum two bars of energy needed to beat the puzzle ). However, they are mercifully few- Not all of the gadgets are acquired via the story, some are literally just laying around, waiting for you to find them ( I'm looking at you, remote electric charge )- A few of the Riddler trophies/riddles actually had me stumped, some riddles required you search around for a little room that exists only to hide the puzzle solution ( which I don't think is entirely fair, but then again, that's just my opinion )TECHNICAL:Pros:- The game does actually run at 25-30 fps averageCons:- You will likely need to turn off a bunch of the fancy graphics options and maybe lower the resolution ( I played it at 1024x768 with none of the fancy options on, and everything set to low. I enjoyed the game immensely, but I also understand not everyone is able to enjoy a game at 25-30 fps with all of the settings turned down/off )OVERALL:Pros:- Good Batman experience- Good ending to the series as a whole ( and, I daresay, a good ending for the Batman mythos )Cons:- There are technical issues; you may want to consider any updates that have been released since this review, as well as what people have been saying on the discussion board, before actually making the purchase"}

For the first few hours the wheel felt dead to me because you only recieve the forces that would be translated to the wheel in the actual car, not a bunch of canned effects as well.

{"text": "Terrible pc port, terrible frame rates, frustrating mechanics... OVERATED because OMG its GTA are words you can describe this game. After who knows how many year this game is still absolute junk on pc. Good luck as this game was designed for the console peasant industry. Terrible pc optimization and mechanics is something which plague GTA IV. Also you NEED SIGN UP FOR GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE which is to put in words the S.H.I.T.I.E.S.T service ever... EVEN WORSE THEN ORIGIN, to SAVE YOUR GAME. AND on top of that you also need to sign up for some rockstar account to play online. FFS the game is on steam, not like DRM is going to make a difference as steam is an excellent service. PLEASE dont repeat the same S.H.I.T for GTA V. PLEASE NO DRM. Otherwise GTA IV would be a very great game as it already has all the qualities of a great game, just the quality of a crap game aswell"}
{"text": "im not great at this game but wow can i reck noobs.So Brawlhalla is a really good brawl  em up/ super smash bro type game. For everyone i knew and recommended it to( and actually played the game) all of them liked it.All of the other games that try and recreate this fail. Brawlhalla is a game which i cannot write a good review about.Damn me, back at it again with the brawler games.why do i still write bad reviews."}
{"text": "TL;DR: There is currently an issue with FFXHD not flagging itself for use on a dedicated GPU in a system with switchable graphics. In addition to this, during my testing (unknowing running on the iGPU), the game has a tendency to crash when transitioning between areas. It's hard to say why, but regardless until these issues are resolved I'd suggest holding off. Users running into issues where FFXHD does not use their dedicated graphics are advised to manually run the executable and forcing the game to use the dedicated graphics in their system.## OVERVIEW AND MAJOR COMPLAINTSAt this point in time, Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD is a known quantity. You can read any review of the previous incarnations of FFXHD to know what the gameplay is like. FFX is a legendary PS2 title, pushing the barrier for graphical fidelity at the time.My biggest gripe so far is the tendency to crash. I've encountered issues where the renderer stops updating the display, causing the game to appear frozen but still be 'playable'. I believe this was an issue with my Intel graphics driver crashing, but haven't done enough testing to see if the issue is still present after a driver update. This could be linked to an issue I talk about in the performance section of this review.The far more common issue is a straight crash-to-desktop when transitioning between areas. It has happened twice during the first underwater segment, and again on Besaid after Wakka asks Tidus to join the blitzball tournament. This is a frustrating problem.## GRAPHICS AND PERFORMANCEThis PC release offers a variety of graphical options and improvements over the various console releases. While gameplay is locked to 30fps, menus appear to render at the refresh rate of your display (which for me is 60Hz). This might be a cause of concern for some, but personally while I'd prefer there be no framerate cap, a game like FFX is perfectly playable at 30fps.In terms of performance, I've been playing FFXHD on my laptop, hardware wise it's a ZenBook UX303LN with a dual-core Core i5-4210U @ 1.7 GHz, a 2GB GeForce 840M and 12GB of RAM. Currently, there appears to be an issue where FFXHD is flagged to run on the iGPU instead of the dGPU, meaning instead of using the GeForce 840M, FFXHD has been running on Intel HD Graphics 4400. This is my primary reason for not recommending this just yet, in addition to the crashes.Performance on the HD 4400 has been above expectations. The game runs at 1080p on the Low preset with textures on High at 30fps in most environments. Typical for integrated graphics, the framerate dips into the mid-20s in scenes with lots of lighting effects. Combat for the most part runs at 30fps (again depending on the environment), but attacks with lots of effects or explosions cause the framerate to tank fairly sharply. The GPU is given full license to clock up to 1,000 MHz with memory at 800 MHz and a temperature of around 73C-75C. I'm fairly impressed with these results given how limited the shader performance and memory bandwidth is on the HD 4400.As for performance on the GeForce 840M, the game runs at 1080p on the Medium preset with textures on High and anti-aliasing turned off. Exploring around the early areas of Besaid the game sticks to 30fps with GPU usage around 95%-98%. In a battle scene on Besaid, GPU usage drops to around 85%. The 840M is allowed to turbo to its full 1,124 MHz core speed and 900 MHz memory speed and temperatures sit at around 73C in my ZenBook UX303LN. Once again, I'm pleased with these results, given the 840M isn't exactly a gaming powerhouse.However, In reality I shouldn't even have to have two sections for performance. The game should be running on dedicated graphics in systems that have it. Whether this is an issue for Square Enix to resolve, or if Nvidia can resolve this with a driver update, it's still dissapppointing to see. Performance numbers across the board are better than I expected, so I see no isses with optimisation here, just the issue with GPU switching and crashes.## CONCLUSIONSThe issues outlined here form the basis of my decision to not recommend this game at this time. Crashing to the desktop is a frustrating experience, and users should not have to manually set a game to run on their dedicated graphics.However, when these issues are resolved, I will ammend this review and give FFXHD a solid recommendation. If you believe you're happy to work around these issues as they currently stand, by all means the game has my recommendation. But until they're resolved, this review ends without a recommendation from me."}

{"text": "Takes me back to the days of playing this beautiful game on the PS2 and Wii. The PC version is basically the Wii version with PC optimisations, although I swear I can see some extra content in the PC version...The Wii version in and of itself was incredible, basically merging the original two PS2 games. In keeping with the Wii game, this is also incredible. It's fun, and a hell of a lot of it. At their core, Lego games are pretty basic: Get your Lego minifigures and go nuts in some themed setting, which appeals amazingly to children (Exhibit A being myself about 10 years ago). But the more intricate features (gold/power brick unlocks, challenge mode, etc.) are enough to keep more hardened gamers (Exhibit A being myself right now) coming back for more.And it's Star Wars. Jar Jar actually has a purpose in this game, and you can quite successfully fight Darth Vader with Darth Vader in Free Play mode.Brilliant game, and the nostalgia rush makes it even better.9.5/10"}

It was a legible attachment to the game, and looking forward to keep playing this. This of course has it's downfalls and the biggest downfall was the suit. I mean would that be a bit heavy for someone who needs to be lightning fast? Look at the logic!.

They will always have some sort of rage message they will send to either you or the team weather you win or lose. There is not escaping rage from other players.However if you can see past the fact that most of the community are ragers or downright rude people then i do recommend this game."}

The PC port is also pretty good, it runs well even on older hardware. Not to mention the game's graphics are pretty amazing. While the game strays far away from Resident Evil's horror style and goes into action, I don't think you should let that stop you from enjoying the game for what it is.

One thing I like was when the central hexagon turned into a pentagon or even a square. But that feature's not used alot, so that was a bit sad, but I can see it was just to add variety to the first/ fourth stage of the game.Overall, my FINAL rating for this game is a 9/10. Something just didn't seem right & for playing for a long time (not over an hour), my forth finger start to hurt a bit. But should you buy this game? YES!!! Is it worth $2.99? DEFINATELY!!!! So, all in all, get this game if you like fast-paced minimalist fast-paced hexagon-based arcade action! But don't if you have strange reactions to flashing lights or anything like that.9/10 would make a hexaflexagon again.Yep, another ?/10 would ? again joke."}

{"text": "Reviewing each episode individually then the game as a hole--------------------------------------SPOILERS AHEAD PLUS THE FACT THAT THIS REVIEW WILL BE INFLUENCED BY THE CHOICES I MADE.--------------------------------------SEASON 1Episode 1. 8/10----------------One was definitely my favourite episode. With the introducement to the main characters Jesse, Axel Olivia and Lucas. This sets off as the three friends attempting to build a fireworks stand at a builders tournament and a introduction to the 'Order Of The Stone' in which the victor gets to meet Gabriel the warrior one of the members of the Order. After all of this crap happens you lose your pig and gotta find him meeting Petra the female feminist empowering character. You and her out to sell a wither skull she has found to the main antagonist Ivory or as I call him 'The Shady Guy'. After the interview with Gabriel, Ivory builds a Wither in which the flask inorder to control is stolen from your good buddy Axel and the witherstorm gones ape S**t and starts consuming endercon completey. After a chain of events in which you can save Petra or Galbriel you enter the nether after this you find yourself at the Order's temple you have to finish puzzles in order to use the amulet Galbriel gave you, oh ye he gives you this magical amulet to track the order. You have to choose to go with Olivia to find Ellegard or with Axel to find Magnus. A great fun episode.Episode 2 6/10-----------In this episode you have to choices I went with Olivia so I will tell the story of Ellegard you find her in her city redstonia in which you have to do some redstone crap and get into her thinking block there you must help her build a command block before the witherstorm comes and flips s**t up yet again. After you return you find Galbriel just chillin in the temple with Lucas. Also Axel went to find the other dude. After this you find the tracker to my boy Soren and attempt to track his footsteps at his temple, The two Order members you picked up get hella mad at each other and leave after you run into Ivory in which you find out he was a former Order member, you engage him in battle until he uses some elixir and runs away trapping you and your buddies in a library. This was an ok episode probs oh though I still reckon it was the worst out of the four.Episode 3 7.5/10-----------In this episode you attempt to find Soren yet again losing the amulet while diging out of the temple finding a mob grinder leads you to the End. In there you find a whole wool world Sorens built and a bunch of enderman he is attempting to make them build. After putting the enderman suit on you try to find him, after finding him he punches you and takes you inside his house. There the enderman siege it and you and your buddies must escape. After coming back to surface you make the Super TNT Crap and Magnus and Ellegard are back together fighting the Witherstorm. There you build the bomb and blow the thing up leading to the death of either Ellegard or Magnus. Getting surviors you see that the command block is not damaged and it starts sucking everything up again yet this time there is 3 of them. Finding either Petra or Galbriel you run away into the next episode. This was a good episode exploring some unique themes of the power of being alone for a long period of time.Episode 4 8/10-----------In this episode you run away from the Witherstorm once again and retreat to a crib in the mountains there you find out that Petra has forgotten everything and doesn't remember you. In which you try to figure out stuff about the Witherstorm. Ivory comes along and Soren gets hell mad that the bomb didn't work but Ivory figures out to destroy it using a Enchanted sword in which you and some of your buddies have to use the horses to go the 'Far Lands.' when finally getting there you complete this maze in which it leads you to Ivorys lab there you find out the truth of the Order of the stone and craft the weapon strong enough to destroy the command block in the Witherstorm. After leaving you finally engage the Witherstorm in combat and destroy the command block but not without pay your poor pig Reuben dies. After Galbriel reveals you and your friends are the new 'Order of the stone.' In the end you can tell to reveal the truth about the order or \"Let the people dream.\" This episode was sick finally ending the Witherstorm and knowing that nobodies can truly become Legendary.Overall Minecraft story-mode is really fun game with unique character creation semi-predicatable and for a so called 'kids game' actually pretty dark with touching moments and moments of sorrow and lack of salvation, though the game was pretty quick only took me 7 hours to finish it's still a really funny sick game defiantly  worth buying. 7.5/10 (LETS SAY 1-4 IS SEASON 1 REGARDLESS AS IT ALL LINKS TOGETHER.)SEASON 2---- (Will review when all episodes come out.)=="}

The shapes they provide is not alot but enough for you to find shapes to go to your design. Of coaurse this comes with a draw back which is the ammount of shapes you can put in. Where you have to get premium in order to get the best experience.I'm sure there are players who Just want to play it and meet friends depending on the other party If he/she is friendly and wants to make new friends or just plain playing with friends for the fun of it like CS:GO then this is also probably for those type of people,There are also the players that wanted to get GTA V BUT can't afford it. APB:Reloaded is another small game Just like it and for those players to enjoy. Sure you won't get the full experience of how GTA V actually plays.

{"text": "It's fun, but there is so much bullsh*t from the attack system and item drops that you pretty much will kill yourself in the first 4 levels. There are better dungeon crawlers out there although for a turn-based one it does things pretty well. My three major gripes with it are the Hunger System, Attack System and the Item System.Hunger is bull, it's hard enough keeping your health up but having to go out of your way to search a level that may or may not have any food on it is stupid, either remove the system or reduce the frequency of its occurences because the Item System isn't helping either.The Item System is interesting, the fact that with Potions, Armour and Weapons you don't know what will happen until you try it is cool, I really like that feature and find it a bit humourous when I drink a potion not thinking to just throw it first and then self-igniting myself. The issue with this system is that the items are rare and sparce, you may go through an entire level and pick up maybe 2-3 items (excluding Dew Drops and Seeds but they're not that useful). Also I often find that it's only after I reach level 3 usually that I actually have a new Sword and Armour, it's annoying that it's that far down and the enemies can do near identical damage to you which makes it a real pain when you just need a Healing Potion or some better armour but you can't get to it because you keep getting killed before you can find any, because the items are so rare in this game.The last one, and I swear to eveyone's based god, the most crippling one to this game, the attack system. The attack system is absolute crap, you will miss more times than you will hit, while your enemies will hit nearly all the time. I can understand with an enemy like the Wraith, as its a ghost that it's hard to hit but when I start at full health with a Healing Potion and can't hit this guy once before dying, that's too far and the Wraith don't even do that much damage so it was a good 12-20 hits. The other thing is that enemies are almost random with the amount of damage they do, I've fought rats that'll deal 1 and 2 damage and I was thinking that I was going to kill it and then it deals a 5 and I'm dead, seriously, the second level introduces this enemy, I can't remember the name for but looks like a squirrel-sort of and it deals a consecutive 3-4 damage almost all the time where I'm luck to land a 6 on them. It's such a pain getting killed by a single creature and it's so annoying when the only thing it says above the enemy is evaded, evaded, evaded, dodged, dodged, evaded. It's painful to watch something like that happen.So if you want a game that'll kill you within 4 levels with no more than 30 enemies get this game, but if your looking for a genuinly fun and enjoyable Dungeon Crawler where each venture is very different, then keep looking because this game is relentless."}

Just because during the ranked matches, i prefer to stick to the maps i know well (the official ones), and replaying them can get a little bit boring. not complaining though, just a thought :)the only two things i think need fixing are the few bugs in the game. sometimes the camera is set completely away from all players- this can go on till the game ends, or just for one or two rounds. Rarely happens, but can get quite annoying when playing in ranked matches. Also, happening once or twice, my player randomly flew off the screen, causing me to die.The other thing, which is a lot less of a problem, is upon opening the game, the window is opened half on-half off my screen. Not sure if i'm the only one, but it's happened on both of my computers. overall great game, you should deffinitely have a play of this when you can!"}

{"text": "At the time of writing, I have completed the main story once and the expansion content, and there's still stuff I haven't done. I also plan to play the game through again to get to all the stuff I missed and the ultimate ending.Dragon's Dogma is a triumph of what all RPGs should aspire to be. Solid, challenging gameplay, classes that not only all play differently, but all feel powerful and fun to use in their own right, great enemy and boss design and unique game mechanics. I am yet to see a game that does many of the things DDDA does, let alone does so well.The pawn system, where each player designs their own constant companion that other players can then take into their game to help them out,  is a great way to make up for the player's weaknesses in a fun and original way while encouraging creativity, co-operation and competition. Each player can try to create the best pawn for their playstyle, or just a fun, creative character to represent them. The more the pawn plays with you or someone else, the more knowledgeable and smart they become.The game really shines, however, in its battle mechanics. The player has so many techniques at their disposal with the skills and augments system, the different classes, and teamwork with your party. You can jump on and climb large enemies to attack their weakpoints directly, or magic users can create platforms there. You can disable different parts of an enemy or inflict debilitating status effects. I'm constantly impressed by how fluid and fast the combat is, and am always discovering new things you can do in combat. In some ways it feels like an MMO, where you work out a strategy for dealing with certain beasts or difficult rooms, and then your entire party works together to accomplish it. The ambush system, where powerful enemies can sometimes appear at random to throw a wrench in your plans, makes every encounter fresh.I preordered this at launch for essentially half price, because of money I earned selling marketplace items, but even if I had gotten it at full price, it's made up its worth in dollars per hour thrice already.A great soundtrack is the icing on the cake in what's a fun, exciting game that will ruin your expectations for every other RPG."}

{"text": "I don't usually review games, even ones I like, but I am reviewing Rebirth for 2 reasons: I wrote a review for the original game, and I enjoy this game beyond any other at the moment. So let's get down to it;Rebirth feels like a perfected version of the first game, the graphics are darker, giving it the sinister effect it needs, and the control feels much smoother which is saying something since the original had a really good control scheme anyway. More or less it's the same game + WoL which is kinda underwhelming but makes up for it with the new mechanics, enemies and characters, which I actually have quite a bit to say about. First off, Azazel is great; but they should balance him in such a way that he can only pick up black hearts and receive black hearts from HP ups.This makes his unlocks (Daemon Tail and Abaddon) more meaningful towards the character.Eden was a nice concept, but I felt it was kinda gimmicky, and honestly don't find myself wanting to play. Lazarus is the same, they should give him a bit more of a defining factor to seperate him from Isaac with an extra life. For suggestions, maybe more synergies or items(I know there are many already though) and maybe an \"Angel\" Character to sort of balance Azazel's prescence. Overall fun game, best I've seen in a while in fact, and tons of replayability. On one side note however, I AM A GOLDEN GOD. Peace out and thanks for reading this garbled mess. Have a nice day!"}
{"text": "I have tried this game during free weekends and finally decided to buy it in the hope that they had fixed the terrible game play. Unfortunately they have not. The core of the gameplay, attacking and blocking the opposition is still broken to the point that the game is not fun, but provides a frustrating experience.It creates anger every time you play it becuase the game field is not fair. Everything feels slow and clunky becuase all the servers lag so badly. Some are better than others, but in the end, those with the best pings will dominate. It is not uncommon to die 10 times and only get 1 kill becuase the lag is so bad. Your actions on screen are not registered and all you end up doing is getting killed unfairly as hits go through your block. This repeats every match, every game.If Torn Banner actually cared about the game, they would have attempted to fix it after all these years instead of making a DLC for it. I cannot recommed this game to anyone, not even when it is on sale as I feel like I should be entitled to a refund. It is not fun nor challenging. It just provides hours of frustration while taking your money and wasting your time."}

{"text": "This game kept bugging me to review but since this is the last time I'll be playing, that's fine with me.On June 20th, 2016 at roughly 3am I will hijack a QANTAS plane departing Perth Airport for Bali, Indonesia. I will smuggle in a 3D printed pistol I had disassembled, placed in a bag and had swallowed earlier to prevent detection. Roughly 20 minutes into takeoff I will enter the in-flight bathroom, produce the bag from my stomach, assemble it, and exit the bathroom. I will then enter the cockpit and place the pistol against the head of the pilot. If the pilots are uncooperative or any person attempts to disarm me, I will shoot the pilots and attempt to take control of the plane myself, if this is impossible I will quickly pull down on the joystick, plunging everyone onboard to their deaths. However, if the pilots do cooperate, or I am able to take control of the plane, we will fly directly to a predetermined secret location in the Philippines where my group will take all remaining passengers hostage. After this a video of demands will be posted onto Facebook, Youtube, Vimeo and Dailymotion through multiple accounts. If our demands are not met within 48 hours, 10 passengers will be executed and a video of their executions posted onlines. Every hour after this will result in another 10 passengers being executed until the demands are met.The game suffers from stuttering issues and a few minor bugs but aside from that, it's quite fun."}

{"text": "If you have a couple of friends who like co-op games, then Payday 2 might be the game for you! Bank Robbery Simulator 2014 is full of varied heists, weapons and awesome looking masks. You'll zip-tie hostages, yell guards into submission, cut down waves of incredibly under-trained SWAT soldiers and make a load of cash while you're at it. You can choose to complete heists using stealth, using silenced weapons and signal jammers to finish the mission. Or you can go guns-blazing, equipping flak jackets and assault rifles to bring down hundreds of your foes. Some of the DLC packs are also well worth it, and silently pulling off a particularly difficult heist with your friends is immensely satisfying. This game is well worth the few dollars it costs, and you'll have countless hours of fun while playing. Take note that the single-player is no where NEAR the quality and standard of co-op, and poor teammate AI will seriously bring you down.As long as you have friends to play with, I can almost be certain that you will love this game.Bring on Payday 3!"}

{"text": "This game makes me twitchy with the creepy atmosphere, it gets your blood pumping seeing the killer off in the distance and when you hear the heartbeat. This game has succeeded in creating a great 4v1 cooperative horror game. There are however a few issues which is mostly due to the people playing the game.First of all, campers at hooks, maybe the developers could make it such that the rate at which the entity kills you is slowed when the killer is around.Secondly, some games can be laggy due to the host's internet connection or sometimes, your own.Thirdly, at the moment you can't queue with friends as survivors however it has been said that that will be implemented soon.Fourth, deranking due to people disconnectingLastly, there are some bugs which weren't present in the beta that have appeared likely due to the new maps and killers.With all this said the game is worth it when you have friends to play it with as there is a private match mode so you can have fun hearing your friends scream and beg for mercy. Do note the game is skill based and you have to think how the survivors think when you're the killer and vice versa"}

{"text": "So since the game is on going I'll talk about what I've played so far. Overall I quite like the game, the plot is interesting and the world is believable. At some points you need to take things with a pinch of salt but being a game of fiction it has a bit of leeway when it comes to being weird. The first chapter is also very well done and had me hooked quite quickly. However as the game progresses it starts to suffer from the more negative aspects of the furry world, and it started to feel more and more like characters were overly unique or sexualized. It actually got to a point where I was playing a game of \"Pick out the good guys by how they look.\" because you could tell these formal and apparently normal people couldn't be good. Some plot points were also a very far reach that made little sense logic wise, but they usually weren't bad. Also I might have not seen it but there really should be a feature that allows you to save whenever rather than making you until the next chapter to get a save point. All up I'd say I enjoyed the game, but its not something I'd recommend to others. If you're a furry that likes the more general parts of the fandom and don't just want porn it should be a fun flick for you. Everyone else would probably be better off investing in a VN that more suits their interests."}

Combat is simple but fun and raiding in parties with friends or even just with other players is quality banter.  The grinding isn't too monotonous and the ability to choose crew/captain traits allows you to decide if you want to level up by trading, exploring or combat- or a mix of the three to keep things interesting."}
{"text": "I would like to say this IS actually a serious review.At first, I thought Team Fortress 2 was a fantastic game. It was a solid team based FPS with an interesting variety of classes and many weapons and items for all of said classes. It seemed great. After a while of playing it, I have realised how boring it is.My problem is that really to have fun, you need to have lots of these weapons to add variety (because otherwise it is repetitive). The only problem is that you have to earn these weapons or trade for them - and by the time you've done all that (which is, again, repetitive and boring), you are tired of playing the game anyway because all you've done is sit around and trade or do the exact same thing over and over.Then there are the people that you may encounter in the servers:Mic-spammers.High-pitched annoying people (raging or asking to trade mostly).Spawn Campers.Etc.(But that stuff is usually on all games with a mic or whatever)I would recommend this game if I felt that you didn't  have to earn the fun rather than just get into the game and have fun right away. Pros: Well-done team-based gameplay.9 classes to choose from.Plenty of weapons, cosmetics.Still updated and maintained.Great art style.Haven't seen a single hacker. Cons: Earning items is a repetitive and boring task. (You are usually automatically considered a noob when you have no cosmetics)As mentioned above - the mic-spammers, etc.Trading or buying items is basically essential if you do not want to be called a noob or terrible.Quite a bit of the community I have are not the most kind people to new, unexperienced players.People seem to enjoy exploiting bugs/glitches.Too many people rage.They are essentially turning the game into a free-to-play crappy version of CS:GO.More cosmetics to have to not be considered a noob with the Gun Mettle update.On top of all those, there is the annoying \"don't kill me I am a X\" or \"don't kill me because I am doing X\" Then there is the abundance of fake youtubers and try-hards who ruin everything for everyone.It was fun for a while, but now it seems like a chore to play."}

This is basically a smaller lmg, which is great because you get to use iron sights and don't have to worry about movement speed as much, while still having the room clearing potential, the accuary is rather low to begin with but can be easily modded to increase to a reasonable amount.                              The Anarchist perk.                 Replace some of your health with armour, regain armor from killing enimies. This perk deck is great because it can essentially let you become a\"mini tank\", being able to have heaps of armor but still being really mobile.                The Wing Butterfly knife.        Pretty average melee, same stats as most other knives but has a awsome charge animation.                Sydney. I love this character, i know people might find her high pitched voice annoying, but i like it. Maybe it's because i'm australian but i don't mind the accent.

What's more he said it'll be done by 2012 Christmast! We were kind of sad when Chrismast time passed and the standalone was no where to be seen.Several months later both good and bad things surfaced. WarZ being released and ofc the final development cycle of Standalone. Everyone thought it would come out 2014 and out of no where. The game appeared on Steam's Early Acess.I instantly bought it and theres something I have to say. It's really ALPHA. So early into alpha that the game is poorly opitimized, no anti-hacks have been implemented and glitches galore. That being said there are some redeeming factors.It's absolute fun. Fun to the point where. I don't care anymore if I died from a glitch. Ironically because this game's loot is so unbalanced that you can gear yourself up in 10 minutes. Looting is soo much fun.

{"text": "Do I recommend this game? YES YES YES. Talk about good gameplay, and an awesoem storyline. This game is mosty better than AC, AC2, AC3 an ACR in my opinion. But, AC4 will win it. On the other hand, if you do not have a computer that cannot run AC4, than this game is the AC game for you. Putting the ridiculously OP counter aside, the battling part of the the game is still decent. The free roam adds more gameplay time in this game, which is always good. Of course, the part where you can recruit assassins is so good. It`s just like AC4, but with assassins, not pirates. So, all around, it is a good game. :)"}

{"text": "I tried. I tried liking this game. I really did. I knew it was CoD or Battlefield, I knew it worked differently. But when that differnece seems to change match to match, I just can't. How someone can, for a distance with a automatic weapon, get me in the head and instanly kill me, yet when I have a shotgun, point blank at an AFKs head, and still not kill them, it's just not fun.And the comunity, my god, the only worse one I've found is Leauge of Legends, and only becuase they were just spiteful of me never having played before rather then helped or even orded me around. In this game... It's just, Alah Ackbar shouted through the mics by people who sound like they aren't old enough legitimently have steam accounts. I've had one game where the people were nice, and the game was fun, and even though I had pretty much the same K/D ratio, I was still a help yo the team and they helpped back.I don't know what the competitive side of this game is like, and I was going to maybe give the mode a go, when I learnt how to play a bit more. But I haven't been able to learn, the experience is so Inconsistent, I just have no idea how anything works.The weapons I get killed by the most, the AWP and AK47, two guns that just don't work like they should, and I can't figure out what other are doing.At the end of every match, you can type things to the other team, but all I've seen is insults and agression.And that's not fun. I can see people who are top notch proffesionals sometimes not having fun while playing bacause it can sometimes be a job to them, but when it seems you need to put job like hours into a game on a casual scale to start enjoying it, it's just... an unsatifing experience.250+ matches, and I've leveled up once. The grind and Climb shouldn't be that steep so soon.Imma give it one more go, maybe in a week or two, I'm burnt out of it for now. One last go to have fun, or it's gonna stop taking up space on my computer. "}

At least that gives a few seconds of excitement."}
{"text": "Really enjoyed this game. The sound, music and design of the game is amazing. When you first open this game and see the glorious 80's rendered in all it's pixel art glory you would never expect the violence that is to follow. There's enough challenge to keep the game interesting and have meant that multiple plays are always enjoyable. The pace of the game is quick which means the player needs to be aware of what's going on at all times, when you let your concentration slip, you die. What this game also has is an interesting story which one could easily imagine being turned into a film, a very dark film. I couldn't recommend this highly enough.

I sort of enjoyed this game it is very much like TF2 but different, ALSO if you have played TF2 your skills will not transfer you will be like the normal bad player in TF2.

I'm surprised at how bug free this has been for me, the performance is great but that may just be my really expensive gaming PC, and as far as winning, the people saying it's impossible are just really bad at it. I almost win every race. Which, is probably the biggest thing I don't like when it comes to racing games. I play FlatOut, there is no challenge at all and I'm pretty much garunteed to overlap the AI every race. This? Well, it is more of a challenge. I pretty much never overlap anyone. Which is good. The AI are actually decent at driving, unlike a lot of other stuff. And the weapons make it even more fun and challenging! Overall, this game is good. I would suggest getting it if you enjoy racing, shooting, and derbying all mashed together."}

After 10 hrs of playing you can now make simple machines like a car, after 50 hrs you make your first plane, after a few 100 failed attempts on how to make and fly one ofcourse. Then the 100-hr mark and you can now make comples stuff but theyre not so polished, then the 200-hr mark (which I have currently), you make your first *insert a unique type of machine here*, after that you now realise that you could've done something with your life with the 200 hours you spent in the game.

As well as the combat system being excellent, the skill tree allows you to customise your character in many different ways.

{"text": "The game is pretty fun, at least I know that Goliath isnt as OP as I though before base on other video/gameplay, but still if you play smart it's fun. Overall I have no problem with the Alpha, except the Thunder Dome. If there's a small gap between the Thunderdome's field and the enviroment such as mountain, the monster can get trapped completely, and can do nothing but stuck there, cant move, leap and other skill cant be use to escape since it treated me as floating in the air... basically I have to wait for the Thunderdome to go off before able to move again, at which point my HP is already down alot since the Hunter still can shoot me in that state.UPDATE: Now after playing it for a while, how do I feel about it? It's fun, it really is. But there're 2 problem I have with it.1. I'm worry that it might have the same problem with TitanFall, it have 1 genius idea and executed really well, but that's all it have. And that's not really worth a full price games, though maybe the final version will have much more to offer2. The Monster is not really OP, but if the Monster is decent enough, and the Hunters' team have only 1 noob but he's either Trapper or Supporter, the Hunters are doomed. Trapper and Supporter are way too important to be handle by someone who dont know how to play them, and by disable them first (usually the supporter first then the trapper, or the otherway around is fine too, just not as effective) the fight become really too easy even for a Stage 2 Goliath. Kraken seem even more OP but I havent try it yet so...I cant wait to see what more can they do with the game in the final product, will put this on my wishlist until then."}

{"text": "Bad Company 2 is a more than acceptable instalment in the acclaimed Battlefield series. The game features a solid, enjoyable campaign that visits varied locations and harnesses an abundant range of weapons which raise the quality of what could otherwise be a stereotypical, conventional and ultimately dull set of missions. Movements and gunplay is fairly smooth and rarely descends into frustrating territory. Locations pop with colour and life, and there's a bona-fide sense of realism present throughout the environment, even when the mission you are completing is anything but. The real highlight and the most popular aspect of Bad Company 2 is the immensely popular multi-player mode. With it's vast maps, unique and diverse arsenal of weapons and great team mechanics, Bad Company 2's multi-player triumphs over its counterpart and frequently compared franchise Call of Duty in many respects. Teams feel more close-knit and dependant on each other than most other multi-player games and locations feel more expansive too. Moments of tension and anticipation, speculating what your opponents will attempt next are nail bitingly pleasant. Making tactical decisions and planning your movements requires more brain-power and strategizing than what may be expected, but when your plan achieves success, the feeling of jubilation is unmatched. It really is a game mode most enjoyed with friends who enjoy planning out their moves and attempting to execute them with precision. And with an addictive levelling up system, you'll find it hard to pull yourself away.Bad Company 2 is a great game and is a genuine classic in the shooter genre. With it's gradually decreasing popularity thanks to the newer instalments in the Battlefield franchise, it's a smart idea to purchase this while the game's community is still thriving. 8.5/10(Written a while ago)"}

{"text": "Jesus, this is a tough one to review.I have extremely polarised opinions abut this game, because the best parts are fantastic, which makes the worst parts even more terrible. The story, writing and gameplay from the original game are back, with some new cast members to either be eaten or saved. That's about as good as it gets, however, because (especially in the second half of the game) the developers seem to have forgotten what made the first one so good.The game is as brutal as the first, but without purpose. In the first one, characters died as a result of your failure to protect them. In this one, people die because the developers said so, and because they want to show how 'dramatic' they can be, forgetting that the key point of drama is audience involvement.The game allows you to brood for ages about whether to reconnect with your old friends, or what to do when your plans fail, and then it'll pull out of nowhere a choice that you can't possibly be prepared for. I remember one particular section in which you have to help one of two endangered allies, but both choices led to the same outcome!I don't want to say that it's all bad. The point-and-click+ style of gameplay is still charming as ever, and there were a few moment of genuine gut-wrench.Just play your cards well when you think about buying this game, and be prepared to slog through some really hard crap to get to the good bits.7/10."}

Even better with the Gekokujo mod for the (urp) weebs. On the visual perspective, this game has a quite slow animation (when your character swings a 2 handed weapon, I didn't quite get the 'hyah' feel when striking your enemy) and it's quite buggy too (not as bad as the sequel though), the overhead view felt empty (grasslands, trees, valleys, and no detail whatsoever). In conclusion, it's not that visually appealing (this is a 2009 game, give more efforts to visual, you see what you play). Gameplay however, 10/10, hands down."}
{"text": "LYNE is a puzzle game, its release date was 17 Mar, 2014. The publisher and developer of this game is Thomas Bowker. This is an intriguing puzzle game, with actual puzzles, you don't walk around and move objects to opens doors and stuff like other puzzlers, in this one it is like a simulation with nifty graphics. The aim of the game is to connect all objects together, and you can't leave any untouched.The game consists of 26 levels, each letter of the english alphabet is a level. Each level consists of 25 puzzles. All up you will end up completeing 650 different puzzles. But thats not it, there are also daily challanges with can have from 1 to 3 puzzles, some are harder than others. The game may seem easy at first, but as you get to higher level letters it can get rather challanging. As you get to higher levels you will get harder puzzles, this means you will get more variety of different colours, different grey ones requering more numbers, and a bigger amount of shapes. It can get rather challanging at the higher levels.You can finish the game anywhere from 10-15 hours, but of course it all depends on how good you are at this game. The achievments in this game are quite unique, everytime you finish a letter you will get an achievment which is that letter, so you can spell words and stuff on your profile in the achievment tab things, its pretty cool.This game is pretty cool, its challanging, cheap... what more could you want, my final verdict is a 9/10"}
{"text": "*BEFORE YOU CONTINUE*I've been in Games Dev for a while now, so everything in this review comes from an industry-grade perspective. I'll try to be as objective as I can, so you can decide for yourself whether or not it's worth it.If a classic top-down RPG is your goal, by all means, get this. It has all you need to get started - the default build even comes with a main AND pause menu!So, let's play pros and cons:Pros:- Simple to navigate UI- A LOT of pre made stuff to make prototyping quickly- Documentation for the programmers- Reasonable price (when I bought it)- People make stuff for this game in Workshop- Some cool stuff in the workshopCons:- It's easy to tell when someone has made a game with this program- Most of the community made graphics conform to the grid of RPG Maker - making most of the stuff look 'generic'- Want to make a turn-based strategy? Best you find something else.- learnerFirendly = preMadeCode ? No : Yes (programmers will understand this); - Documentation isn't as in-depth as some of the meatier engines out there- People make stuff for this game in Workshop- Pre-made events make it easier, but what if you wanted to make a game in a different engine?TL;DRGood for top-down RPGs, not so much for other games - but not impossible"}

I recommend it even if you just stay in the lower tiers."}

{"text": "I have been searching for an old school brutal RPG for so long that I had almost given up, until now.  Everthing about this game speaks of patience, time and careful  development.   The developer/s have clearly played a vast array of games themselves and have created a game that will speak to the sophisticated RPG'er who isn't solely drawn to graphical thrills. The depth of character development and it's importance to your longevity in the game world is something I cannot stress you enough to take your time with.This turn based RPG is unforgiving and it's game types and difficulties are designed to help you learn to survive.  There is no \"Loading a save game\"  when you're about to be 2 hit by a unique boss twice your lvl who has just seen you, warped behind you cackling with glee at it's next meal.  Brutal, ingenious and rewarding, this game will challenge you to develop strategies just get out alive more often than being concerned about killing your foe.You only have so many lives Adventurer.98 / 100"}

It is a great indie game that changes, evolves and develops as  you play it, starting as a black and white, 2D adventure game like the original Legend of Zelda, and developing into a fully coloured, 3D, free roam, adventure RPG more like Final Fantasy. The game is enjoyable, short and funny and has a great soundtrack, I would definitely recomend this game to lovers of old adventure games and whom want to relive their history and all the changes they have gone through to become what they are today.Thanks for reading, Jazza."}

{"text": "With all the hubbub around another great recent sprite-based indie RPG, I keep recommending those that liked that one to try out LISA.It's a post-apocalyptic tale of a father searching for his daughter in a hellscape full of twisted mutants and the worst of humanity that will play at your emotions and expectations, part absurdist, part horrifyingly real.The battle system is unique, with a big emphasis on status effects and dialing in combos like a fighting game. While some of these techniques (anything involving tripping, oil+fire attacks) will turn most battles into a cakewalk, it's offset by the ridiculous brutality of many of the bosses.However, the story and writing is the best part of the game. The creator toes a fine line between absurd, often crude or sardonic humour and extremely serious moments that will have you on the edge of your seat. Many times you will have to choose between two horrible decisions, and the consequences will impact the rest of your game. There are no happy endings in The Painful RPG and the game will always remind you of the awful choices you made.A twisted and groovy soundtrack tops it all off. I am yet to find another game quite like LISA."}

{"text": "The Gods are angry. Calamity wracks the land and ravening hordes of mythical creatures are attacking hapless tax-dodging villages all over Greece. In this hour of dire need, even the Spartan King Leonidas (taking a break from kicking innocent Persians into deep holes and prancing about in a leather jockstrap and cape) has joined forces with their ancient enemies the Greeks. Perhaps the Gods are sick of yet another Greek bailout, or perhaps the Centaurs are livid at being sold Horse Meat Lasagne. Who knows. Greece needs a mighty hero (and probably better Beef inspectors). Are you up to the challenge?Published in 2006, TQ is an excellent Action RPG that has aged very well and a game I still play. To be properly playable, the expansion Immortal Throne is mandatory. As is the Titan Quest Fanpatch 1.17a, the Patchfix for Fanpatch 1.17, SSTQDefilerNET (RNG Function Fix, Slow Cast Fix) and TQ Vault (an out-of-game inventory management program to preserve your sanity). For truely mighty heroes, the following mods are recommended: 'm4ssboss3s-clean' and 'monsters-xmax'."}

You'll probably play the game in quick bursts and die often. I can't even get past the cavern levels. The constant dying might wear you down but the game keeps you invested by awarding points at the end of each run which go into a progression bar which unlocks new play dynamics and new palettes. Downwell is simple in its execution and a very tight experience. Downwell does what it needs to do and does it perfectly."}

Furthermore the species creator is very interesting, the implications of ethics and the political possibilities that they produce is just great. I do not know in what way that this game is worse than any other 4X game out at the moment. Masterful AdditionsTechnology - A genius idea of having there be 3 tech trees going at once, Science, Engineering, Social. So you are not waiting around for that 1 technology you are researching to drop, you have three techs on the go all at once. Loved that addition.Unit Builder - I thought that the ship building was actually better than Galactic Civ 3 even though it lacked the sheer customisability of GC3. I found my choices were more significant, and that the ships I was building were more meaningful to me because of it. Different Species - Oh the different species, and all of their lovely art, and differences. I loved that i can conqure a people who are better adapted to arctic planets and then just deport them off their lush contiental planets to the arctic planets i have not yet fully colonised, so that i can settle my more continentally adapted prime species onto it. I love all the different ethics, and i love how my peoples happiness is so effected by how i behave. "}

If this sounds interesting to you, I'd recommend taking your time with it.One technical addition, as you're not running around with 30 other users blowing things up, the pull on your resources isn't as much, so assuming your system can handle it, you can crank everything up to max and enjoy the scenery even more."}

{"text": "-Don't mind my hours spent, I've clocked crapton of hours on Xbox 360.-Review on SP only.Dead Island is no stranger to the zombie mania. It's a definite win for avid zombie fans and is a reminiscence for the good old times. Dead Island has an array of features not only the brain dead zombies per se but also weapon crafting, somewhat open-world experience and at times, mowing down horde of zombies with a rusty car. It's a great game indeed and deserve the accolade as TMoZG. [As if that acronym exist] On the other hand, unlike the console platform, the PC platform does have it's flaws. In hindsight, the game does stutters due to poor optimization even with a GTX 760. But then again, that's about it. Oh, totally not for the weak-hearted. Compared to Dead Island Riptide, this stands out. Nothing beats the original that's for sure. Having said all of these, Dead Island does pumped me up for Dying light and Dead Island 2 as a starter kit."}

{"text": "Started out strong: funny protagonist, the awesome recoiless submachine gun, big chunky enemies for you to pump your lead into, and last but not least, wang cookies.And then midway through the game, you will find that the game's initial charms start to wear off. The game never deviates from its initial path: the same 'wang' jokes are told time and again, the new jokes err more on the side of cringe-worthy instead of funny. The cool weapons become underpowered as the game starts to pile more and more fatties at you at any single point in time. The level design is dreadfully uninspired and boring. You run from point to point triggering the game's setpieces in order to spawn the various over-used enemies which the game throws at you in every chapter. In between the points, you will almost never find any enemies lurking or patrolling. The katana is the game's saving point, severing limbs and decapitating heads never gets old. However, the hit boxes for the larger sized enemies are a little wonky, so you might find yourself supposedly slashing at the back of the bugger, only to be disappointed that none of the hits registered.

{"text": "How many times does a company need to get it right?after2 releases and numerous patches its in worse shape than it has ever been.Latency/connection has, for some reason, gotton worse on this release. So again, don't bother with pvp.Covenants are STILL broken, why bother with anything else than blood brothers? the rest are broken and dont work as intended.Durability bug? yup still there.The thing that gripes me the most of all, is the imbalance of items in the game. Some weapons and armor are so profoundly overpowered than other equipment, that it makes no sense to use anything else. Which leads to a dull repetitve game with the same thing over and over again.If you own the vanilla dark souls 2, dont buy this, its a downgrade.keep away from this stinker, nothing to see here."}

{"text": "This game is wrongly accused of being pay-to-win. This is a pay-to-progress title, and the devs are workgin on making it less and less so. By reducing the bonuses of being a premium member, they have decreased the in game money gain so everyone needs to farm. There is no reason to get mad when people pay up to $100 for a tank in a video game, it's their moeny and their choice. If this game was pay-to-win, then there would be things that only premium members can access that normal members can't. There are only 2 things that a premium member can access that a F2P member cant. Those are the extra inventory slots for your weapons, which is useless as you can only tkae a maximum of 3 weapons anyway as you cant carry too much weight. The second is an extra combat badge slot, to those who dont know what that is, you can equip 1 badge if F2P and 2 if you are a premium member, these give you small bonuses which dont affect the tide of battle. In saying that, they hardly affect a single soldiers gameplay that much, and can be countered easily with skill. All in all, don't be disgruntled by all the negative reviews from people whining about the game being pay-to-win because its really not. If you feel like you need a game to pass some time then give this a go and make your own call but dont review it after 60 hrs... Happy to answer any questions or disscuss with anyone about this game on any topic, add me for info and thank you for reading. ENJOY THE GAME"}

{"text": "Probably the best game on the genre. You can build anything you want if you are a builder, or you can enjoy cool monster and boss fights if you like the dangerous side of the life (YAY). I've got over 1000 hours of gameplay on Terraria, like playing alone, editing custom maps and multiplayer co-op adventure or PVP. This game is awesome. With a awesome team working on its mechanics and sprites, and the great community that the game have, you'll feel like you're at home. I give a 10/10, cause it's completely awesome!PROS: - Boss fights!- Game biomes make it always different.- NPCs!- Every world is different.- +1000 ITEMS!CONS:- Finite worlds.- Don't have a story.- Don't have a local \"Creative Mode\" (you have to download a certain Mod)- Don't have QUESTS (actually there is a new Angler NPC who asks if you can catch certain type of fish, but I mean REAL quests, like the RPG ones)"}

{"text": "Borderlands 2 is a rpg, Fps. This game is worth the money but not only is it an fps but quite wacky and bizzare making it one of the most unique and different game of all time. Borderlands 2 contains quite a few dlc that last very long. It also have 3 headhunter dlc which are short and only give out alot of skins and heads for your character.Borderlands 2 has a wide variety of bosses and mini-bosses such as knuckledragger,boom-bewm and captain flynt. Borderlands 2 a great solo game but when friends come on its raid boss time! Raid bosses are tough bosses and usually need a few peopel to defeat. An example is terramorphous, He is a big powerful monster who can wipe you off the map. Some raid bosses are Hyperius, Master Gee, Voracidous and dexidous.Borderlands 2 has a million different types of weapons, Many are found randomly but some 'Unique' weapons which are usually marked with red text saying something about the weapon. Every boss in borderlands 2 drops a unique which you will need to farm for. Farming is when you fight the boss over and over again for his rarest loot. Some bosses only have a 1 in 200 chance of dropping their unique. Raid bosses drop and legendaries. Borderlands 2 is a great game and easily a 9.5 out of 10"}

Honestly, ignore the thumb, because whether or not I'd recommend this game depends on the person. Some people will find endless hours of entertainment exploring the environments and finding creative ways to break the game, while for others, the novelty of goat ragdoll contortions will wear off within the first 20 minutes.My advice? There are ridiculous numbers of videos on YouTube of people playing this game. Watch a few, see if you think you might like it. If you do, then good luck and happy glitching!"}

This game was made for for apple ipads and iphones using only touchscreen controls, then ported to pc...badly. I would have thought that the developers would have tweaked the controls and graphics for the modified crystal engine that Human Revolution used. Did they? No - they used the Unity engine that they used for iOS and seem to have paid absolutely no attention to converting touch controls for mouse and keyboard.As a result the game is virtually unplayable and Eidos has shafted many loyal fans for the sake of easy profits.P.S. For once, Twilight is a better love story than this game"}
{"text": "Would I reccomend this game? Yes, absolutely it is glorious. If you haven't played killing floor one I'd reccomend waiting till after early access when the game is complete, at the moment it is barebones, 4 classes and not that many weapons for each.That said each and every weapon is beautiful, each and every sound is bowel looseningly awesome, every bullet is a glory to watch, zed time, oh yes zed time.This game is not complete and yet already I am incredibly happy with my purchase, it is amazing and so much fun.p.s throwing money at the boss will drop his health.

It offers little that the console version didn't, and doesn't even have online play. The game runs well, but as it's a PS3 port (yes PS3, not PS4) i would expect nothing less. It's more DoA, if you need that in your life then get the game, otherwise, buy it on console or don't buy it at all."}

{"text": "**This review is based on the base game**A great grand strategy game from Paradox.  The first in their 4 strategy series, this game is set in the medieval period, streching from Ireland to India and Iceland to Mali.  The base game ranges from 1066 (norman invasion) - 1453 (fall of constantinople).  In CKII you try to continue dynasty - trying to make it the most prestigous in Europe!  The game is centered around your dynasty and succession.  If your heir is not of your dynasty, it's game over.You start as a count/earl, duke, king or emporer controlling one of the counties, duchies, kingdoms or empires on the map.  Without any DLCs, you can only be a christian ruler and not a merchant rebublic.  You cannot be a theology (pope/bishop).  The game also features baronies, cities and bishoprics but that cannot be your primary title.  As a ruler you manage vassals (rulers below you) and try to please - or overthrow - your leige (ruler above you).  The feudal ranking is as below (above = liege; below = vassal): - Emporer - King - Duke - Baron/Bishop/MayorYou can be a liege to someone below you, but not equal or above you.  Your vassals are only below you - not equal to you.A Catholic (usually) follows the pope, and the pope can orders crusades.  The crusades can be based on real historical crusades (such as many of the ones for Jerusalem) and crusades to rid infidels/heritics.  Any catholic ruler can join a crusade, and the winner of the crusade is defined by how much they contributed to the crusade.  Winning the crusade will sometimes grant the winner all titles (including baronies).Each character has traits.  Your traits affect peoples opinion of you and your diplomacy, martial, stewardship, intriuge and learning level.  Traits will be passed on by the guardian of a child and by events occuring to an adult (16+).  Few traits will be passed on through birth (such as genius) but there is only a small chance.One of the games biggest features is Casus Beli (CB).  A CB is a justificaiton for war - something you need to attack a ruler of your own faith. CBs can range from De Jure claims to Overthrow ruler.  A claim is just that - you or one of your courtiers is related to the ruler of the title you want.  Whether that relation is a blood relation, or through marriage it doesn't matter.  The independence or overthrow ruler CBs are against you liege, and are self explanetory.  Holy wars can be declared on heretics/infidels.  Another type of claim is the de jure claim.De jure is where is the title is traditionally in that duchy/kingdom/empire.  For example, the duchy of cornwall is de jure Wales, but is owned by England.  It takes 100 years for de jure to change, and it will only change if you have the whole duchy.CKII is an excellent strategy game - if you have the patience.  It can be quite frustrating at times, and will boggle your mind with all the confusing succession laws.  This game is a great mix of plotting, pleasing and prisoning, not to mention declaring all of that war.  With over $100 worth of DLC, there is a huge base for expansion and the game also has a big modding community.9/10"}

Skyrim in particular is my favourite title. While the main story is amazing in it's own right (last boss is slightly disappointing) there are hundreds of hours worth of exploring, listening to dialogue and doing side quests. If that isn't enough there is a thriving modding community on Skyrim nexus and the steam workshop. I've played Skyrim A LOT spanning over many different profiles and still to this day there is something new that surprises me. While Skyrim isn't as deep as RPGs go it is a world filled with emersive characters and storylines: the voice acting is top notch (they have Mario as part of the cast!) and the artwork on the city designs such as Windhelm is fantastic. While Sword and Sorcery isn't for everyone Skyrim is dumbed down to a point where it's enjoyable to almost anyone. I'm probably late on this anyway..."}

{"text": "This game is outright awful. Its major problem is that it is purely an RPG, merely with a FPS perspective (and while RPGs typically boil down to stat designation to compensate for not having any gameplay- a FPS game has no excuse, especially when other FPS like FarCry 3 mix RPG elements perfectly fine). -Interface is clumsy-Skills system is awful- instead of simply enhancing your proficiency or giving you new, handy abilities (like FC3), it simply unlocks arbitrary \"XX minimum skill level required before you are allowed to do this task\" restrictions. And the only way to level up is to hunt down hundreds of enemies, it seems. Also, you get very poor information as to what leveling up otherwise does for you-Weapons are clumsy and weak. A fake 'ironsights' mechanic doesn't help.-Enemies are boring and scarce-Exploration is a chore as everything is so far apart with no faster way of travelling to new areas than walking slowly to them-You want to avoid collecting items as they make you heavier, and you're not allowed to fast-travel for some reason, forcing you to open up your options menu and manually take out dozens of items until your weight gets back into the green-Lots of bugs and glitches- game crashed a few times, and that part where the bad guy shoots the sheriff? Apparently I was supposed to sit back and watch, as punching him causes the sheriff to shoot me instead, ignoring the other guy.-Tutorials are obscene- typically FPSs presume you already know how to walk and hit the 'e' key, but presume you don't know the more advanced mechanics like how 'stealing' works, Karma works, is there a consequence for shooting drones or picking up too many objects, how radiation poisoning works. Not this game, instead it spends 30 or so minutes dragging us through the obvious mechanics, and expects the player to figure the rest for themselves.I don't recommend even playing it. I wish I actually didn't."}

Even if you still don't get hooked on the story, the gameplay alone is worth every minute. The puzzles will make you twitch with delight or want to kill something beautiful but the non-linear gameplay means you can skip anything and return without having to 'endure' a tough spot.Not convinced?

The plot is simple because all you need to do is to go from a safe house to another killing everything which is in your way. I spent on over 2k hours on and the price is worth it, that's why i highly suggest everyone who's interested in good content should try this.It has its ups and downs. You can basically meet all sorts of people in the community, nicer or less nicer, from where you can choose to play further. This is why it's very competitive. From time to time, you can experience minor bugs but they don't downgrade the experience.In conclusion, I give this game 10/10, one of the best old games out there!"}

One of the most appealing things about this game is just its all-round humour. While being a tad childish, you can still get a laugh out of some of the jokes - especially the stereotypes.

While the story is definitely set out well and Virgil, the new core, is a joyful addition to the game this can often be undercut by the difficulty of the game, as it will often take vigorous methodical work to even get close to an answer for a course that is something you wouldn't even consider as it goes against the puzzle solving mechanics of the original two games.However, the voice-acting, interactions with Virgil and the very pleasant old timey feel of the game helps to push you through it, and at a total of zero dollars makes for an enjoyable journey through the old Portal universe that you've been missing for four years. I would definitely recommend it for those who've been waiting for Portal 3, as it may be the closest we'll ever get, but maybe not for those with short patience, as it is definitely a game of hard thinking.The ending is superb, it has a beautiful soundtrack, Virgil is a splendid character to take you on the adventure and in the end the game just FEELS like a new Portal game. It is fantastically well done and fantastically difficult."}

{"text": "Fez has the nostalgic feeling of 2D platformer games and has the complexity of puzzle games. You navigate through obstacles by changing the angle of your perception when at times things are impossible to reach at one angle become available in the other. At times the game will be a bit confusing, tiring and frustrating but that is the test of puzzle games for you.Though this game might not be for some, it is still an enjoyable game in its own. Having its originality in its concept and application it is commendable that it is one of those unique games that will be remembered."}

{"text": "Ace of Spades. Before Jagex was on the scene, this game had potential. I was an early Alpha tester and I must say, the game was good. In Beta it was even better. When it was first released on Steam, I played it non-stop for 6 hours. Then I played in short bursts with friends. Then, after I hadn't been on for about 2 months, everything had changed. Apparently Jagex decided the game wasn't traffic, or at least that's what it came across as. So they tried to make it better. But they made it a despicable game. Ace of Spades is no longer worth its non sale price of $15. It's not even worth $2. I just wish Jagex would listen to the desperate people who used to play AoS to restore it to what it used to be. It's just not worth it anymore.2/10"}

{"text": "Much shoot 'em upSuch loot gatheringMany gunsWowFirst of all this game is amazing, the visuals are great and I love the cel shaders (cartoon black lines). All the play time I've put into this game has been mostly single player. (shameful). But the few multiplayer games I played were much more fun. The dlc's this game has are awesome.. they add  an insane amount of playtime and way more guns. I enjoyed all of them, but the least enjoyable was the Pirates Booty dlc. It was very dissapointing with just reskinned bandits. The Torgue DLC was one of my favourites, due to me loving bikes and sick as guitar riffs. It is sort of weak with the reskinned bandits again, but it was still really enjoyable. The Hammerlock DLC was very different and very good. The new enemies and different archetypes really get you to think of how you tackle different groups. the final dlc, Tiny Tina's Assault was unreal. There was nothing reused with everything having an upgrade to suit to the Medieval world of Bunkers and BadassesTo summarise, this game is possible my fav shooter based game, I love the rpg elements and the classes are insanely well thought out and are very interesting. The story is written so well and the voice acting is very well performed. The game is full of little funny puns (Like suicide Psychos screaming YOLO just as they explode into a violent cloud of red mist is much more entertaining than it should be)!!I give this 10/10 and it has earned a BADASS seal of approval!"}

{"text": "Ok. Before I begin my rant, good game. I bought Godus in its really early stages (before a single player review was released), liked it, but got bored after a while. Every so often I would revisit and check it out again. So I heard Godus v2.0 was out. Sweet! I try it and I like it. A lot. It was better than the old version by far - except for the bugs. The tons and tons of bugs. Some black squares appear after a while and flash around - driving me crazy. But when I restart the game they go away. No biggie. After some progress I finally discover voyaging. I try it once, but then I have to go. I come back two days later, the game loads, opens up, and the crashes. Straight away. No warning, nothing. I've tried tons of times to fix it - but nothing works. Seriously guys! Why would you release a super buggy game?! I would have been more than happy to wait that extra however-long-it-takes so that you can have a good v2.0! Not cool. Anyways, good game, very buggy - and now I can't play it anymore."}

For me, this game seemed like an experiment, a way to make people think about how something that we see as insignificant in our everyday life can be percieved as a subject of philosophical debate. Cutting all of that sophisticated sounding stuff out, just wow. I started playing the game and noticed that you only had 2 options in the menu, Start and Exit... No Options, No Credits, Not even a Help button, Just Start and Exit. The game doesn't give you instructions and it doesn't hint at places, It just simply asks whether you want to play or not. Now for people who don't really understand how texts can hold hidden meanings, (i.e. People who haven't been bored out of there life listening to shakespeare in High School or haven't figured it out already), this might seem like a 5 minute game where they put extreme details into the animations of a fly.

If you don't know what i mean you will after playing thios game for a few hours.Unfortunatily no matter how awesome Saints Row VI is i can't get behind the aliens.Specifically driving down a section of road just chillen to hack a station and they will just pop up out of nowhere when you haven't even raised a enemy alarm. Just annoys alot cause you can barely get a good pedestrain bumper combo before the alein swarm wrecks everything. Awesome game with new powers, weapons that run on energy instead of bullets so that's a huge saving in ammo.The ability to run super-fast and smash vechiles out of the way is really awesome if you need a quick getaway."}

{"text": "I've been falsely VAC banned on this game before, but legitimate cheaters are always plaguing matches.CSS is better than this and that's a simple fact. In CSS you can't spray, there's no RNG and it's more balanced. In CSGO, you can spray with weapons like the Bizon, there is so much RNG with your weapon accuracy and the weapons arsenal is biased in favour of the Terrorist team.One of the biggest turnoffs is the extremely toxic community. Let us compare CSS and CSGO once again: In CSS you had chill, down to Earth people who you could talk to, make friends, learn about the game, etc. CSGO's community on the other hand is full of raging tryhards who flame everyone, even their own team, and act like they're the hot shot who is carrying the team. Additionally, you have a lot of hackers and dodgy Russians on VPNs trying to scam you.Oh yeah, and the ranked system is stupid too because it seems to be completely unable to match up players of a similar skill."}

Some PC gamers have a setup that is not easy to remove a joystick for various reasons, joysticks are not easy to disable on a window system. These new games see joysicks as a gamepad and use buttons and any axis across any or all of the attached joysticks and disable the keyboard alltogether making the game unplayable. Simple fix is dont downgrade PC inputs to suit a 10-15 button gamepad."}

{"text": "To put it bluntly, Broken Age is fantastic.The game is a classic point-and-click adventure, in the vein of the Lucasfilm Classics. For those of you who have been living under a rock for two years, Broken Age (previously known as Double Fine Adventure) was a huge kickstarter success, finishing up with over 3 million in crowd-sourced funds. Being one of the original big Kickstarter projects, there was some worry, but Double Fine pulled through in the most stylish way possible.The game is split into two parts, which is.... split into another two parts.This is a review of Act 1. Act 2 will be released some time this year, and here's hoping it's as good as this act. In each act there are two tales to play, both incredibly different, but linked in many, many ways. In one, you play as Vella, a girl forced into tradition. In the other you play as Shay, a boy forced to stay in a spaceship his whole life. Both stories are incredibly fun to play. On your first playthrough you may not notice the similarities between the stories, but if you think about them and put the events together in your mind, you realise how linked these tales are. I can't describe the amazing feeling I had when I discovered these connections. I can't really describe them without completely spoiling the game though.The gameplay is what you would expect from any adventure game. It's fun, puzzling and satisfying. The only downfall is the sheer simplicity of the puzzles. I only really got stuck on one puzzle and even then it's because I just didn't notice one item amongst the background. However, this is actually a pro for younger gamers, as they will enjoy it without getting frustrated.The art. Oh man, the art. It's gorgeous. I can say no more, just look at the screenshots.The music is fantastic as in most Double Fine games. Some great peaceful, ambient tunes to relax you as the gears in your head grind.The story is obviously great, with some excellent writing. The biggest caveat in adventure games for me is feeling bored as lines and lines of text go on and on. In this game though, I was always interested, clicking on every dialogue option available. The AAA voice acting helps a lot too. Before you ask, yes, Jennifer Hale is in it.Overall, Broken Age is a must-buy. Generally I don't preorder or buy games at launch, I just wait for a sale. But this time I did and it was worth every dollar. The length may be an issue, but for me just Act 1 was worth the purchase, but with another act on the way, there's really no reason not to buy this ASAP. What more can I say? Brilliant art, music, puzzle design, writing, voice acting.... It all helps to make this a great, great game. Do yourself a favour and pick this up. You won't regret it."}

For starters the devs probably know this game is crap because all they gave us for the game was 3D model in desc no gameplay. I have seen so many people request things but the devs couldn't care less. The camera is bad, infantry and sometimes vehicles just go through walls. And out of all the time i have played it just doesn't have that, FUN feel. I highly recommend you do NOT buy the game.

{"text": "bought it, love it. i invested in the nemesis bundle because i was afraid that i'd get stuck with a lame default mech, but the fact of the matter is it doesnt matter what mech you use, you can still win. i wouldnt use the term \"pay to win\" but if you're willing to put in some cash it grants you quicker access to some weapons and perks than having to play for hours on end. the only thins you have to pay for are the cosmetics, everything that affects gameplay can be acheived by earning HC (Hawken Credits) which you get based more on play time than anything else, but you can increase the amount slightly by achieving a higher score in any given game mode. there is only one thing i think could be changed, i just feel like everythings a bit over priced when it comes to using the HC, its better than a lot of other games that have a dual currency system, but it could be better, especially since when you spend 3000 credits on a perk that only works on the mech you bought it for. Ultimately, i feel like the reward system is a bit harsh because you have to buy the same things multiple times if you want to use more than one mech, but other than that its a great game and i highly recommend it"}

I couldn't think of a different game from the series I would recommend one plays first than this.And with that, you'd have to play this first.

{"text": "I have been waiting for this game to come out ever since the release of their original demo. I must have played those few levels over and over for probably a total of hours so you can imagine my excitement when they got greenlit and set up a Kickstarter. I followed them through all that time until finally it came to their point of release. The GameSuperhot is a game about using time to your advantage. The more you move the faster time moves. If you're standing still it is to the point of almost being stopped. You can watch the bullets slowly fly past you (Or into you). If you're shooting or moving around quickly it speeds up to around real time depending on how you're moving. This allows you to get out of situations with multiple enemies that may seem impossible considering you have no health and die in one hit. It also allows for amazing looking replays when sped up to real time.The VisualsThe game has a scheme of three colours, red for the enemies, black for weapons and white for the environment. However it couldn't work better with the game. It makes it easy to pick out enemies and weapons around the area whilst still being able to create an environment. The enemies are made of glass which provides a satisfying shatter sound and visual upon killing them. There is no blood or gore just broken glass. The weapons also shatter upon impact should you throw them at a wall or enemy. The whole thing creates a style that seems crystalline and pristine whilst also creating an air of fragility.The CampaignThe campaign is short, only around 2-3 hours long, but it couldn't have been made better. Each level is a different environment with a different setup of enemies. Some of the levels put you in immediate danger, forcing you to figure out tactics through trial and error but an instant restart system negates any annoyance that may cause. The whole campaign is underlined by a story which breeds intrigue as well as adds an unsettling feeling to it all.SummarySuperhot is exactly the game I hoped for ever since playing the demo. The mechanics are smooth and the whole thing is visually appealing. The levels are inventive and the story solid and well done despite almost not being essential. However the $24.99 USD price tag ($35.07 AUD) for a 2-3 hour long campaign may seem a bit much. I would recommend waiting for a sale that's somewhere around 50% off and picking it up then. There are challenge and endless modes which are exactly what they sound like but they still don't really provide enough for what they're asking. Despite the cost I enjoyed playing this game immensely and would highly recommend it to anyone who wishes they could take their time with first person shooters. TL;DRPros Innovative time mechanics Simple yet perfect visuals Interesting and unsettling story Smooth and responsive controls Endless and challenge modesCons Campaign only 2-3 hours $24.99 USD price tag for that time"}

{"text": "Gaben is love, Gaben is lifeAs a child i always lived PC games, i used to beg my Dad to buy me games, i would pray to LORD GABEN at night, hoping that he would grant me sales.Gaben would always give me sales usually 75% off. I had all the Valve games and would constantly trade and open cases. Keys were expensive.My Father could hear me praying to gaben, he came in and smashed my computer against the wall, i was crying over the smashed up parts crunched up on the floor. I started on cry over the loss of my Gaming pc. I knew my Dad was jealous for my devoting to Gaben. I start to fall asleep. I feel a strange presence enter my room. I quickly woke up to find Gaben. standing next to my Bed. \"its gaben\" i loudly though to myself\". I am so happy to see him. Gaben then uses his powers to lift up my broken pc and repair it with his mind. I am so thankful that he did such a kind thing. Gaben then proceeds to walk up to me. He then whispers in my ear,\" this is my hat\", i threw my Ghastly gibus at him, he rejects it and bends me over the bed, he enters my his fat fingers into my pants. but went for my pocket instead and takes out my wallet, he uses his magic to grant me 95% sales on all the games on my wishlist. Then penetrates my wallet and takes $10 out it is expensive but i do it for gaben. it is uncomfortable. He then proceeds to take out a $50 note, in the irritation i scream out \"Fluttershy is best pony, not pinkie\". Gaben is furious now and throws me against the wall, which reveals a secret wall safe. He walks over to the safe and takes out all my money, then begins to penetrate my tight butt hole, it hurts but i do it for Gaben. The noise attracts my dad to the room. My dad enters the room and finds me bent over in the corner in tears of joy and pain, while he sees gaben thrusting my hard. Gaben turns to my dad and looks him dead in the eye and flies out the window and says his last words 'Gaben is love, Gaben is life', followed by, \"you will never resist my sales\". i am now nearly unconscious in satisfaction as drool flows out of my mouth and i am still curled up in a bent over position."}

{"text": "like many a review of this game on the internet, this review will just be about praise for this game.this game, though not without flaws, is a shining example amongst indie games, and what just a few people can do in a short time.firstly the good stuff:-the game is visually impressive, being very colourful, flashy, yet simple. it easily cathces your attention.-has a superb dubstep soundtrack and it only gets larger the more CD's you get (even if it is very limited)-simple, easily understood controls that allow for well, simple and difficult gameplay.-an upgrade system that simultaneously unlocks new abilities and songs for (via the aformentioned CD's)-fun, addictive, arcade style gamplay that you can just pick up.now the bad:-while the contrls are easily understood, the game itself doenst convey how to use the controls very well-there is no way to check the controls again once you've started playing.-the graphics options are limited at best, and the resolution options are pretty bad.-no online rankings as of yet (i hear that will be fixed soon though)-severe lack of modes and different playstyles (the game couldve benefitted greatly from having an unlockable charecter or two).-post game is severly lacking, and being so short, you need something to rope you players back in (again, unlockable charecters)-and finally, you cant buy the soundtrack from steam. this seems like a minor thing, but after playing this for about 3 hours, i wanted to support the devs by buying there soundtrack, and lo and behold, you can't.overall, the game, while a bucket load of fun and value ($2 people), it has an even greater amount of minor flaws that hold it back from being a perfect arcade-e, style shoot em up sort of game (i have no clue what genre this game is).when the kinks are ironed out, and an extra charecter is added, then i can whole heartedly give this a 9/10, but until then its a 7/10."}

{"text": "So i brought this game because it did looked like a nice space sim, and I have always wanted to play another space sim, but have not found any recient space sims appealing. The first 60 hours of the game were great, the spaces ships felt great, the atmosphere was great. The after a few days of getting into the game everything when downhill. The space ships were expensive, the replacement cost was getting higher and higher, the missions at the stations were still only offering 10k per job, and all of this became not only became a huge grind for credits (in-game money) but it really wasnt even worth doing as I was being constantly kill by players in pythons and anaconda space ships (the best ships in the game.)To sum things up is that I got really bored of this game very quick, as all it really seems to be is 400 something star systems with with same 4 types of space stations, and 20 of the same space craft.Pros+Nice hud.+Nice space station design. +Nice sound of thrusters.+Nice space ship design.Cons-Repeative gameplay.-lack of Space station design.-lack of Space ship design.  -Expensive ship replacment (if player is destroyed)-Lack of jobs-Lack of credits paid for jobs.-Unbalanced ships.-Is not new player friendly-Paying for different paint job with real money.-Players in high tech ships such as the python and anaconda destroying you, just to troll you.This game felt like it had great potential, but is nothing more then a copy and paste game, which features the same solar systems with the same 4 types of space stations everywhere in the game."}

{"text": "The Witcher is definitly not for the faint of heart. It has an impressive main story with plenty of interesting and dark plot points. It also boasts a fairly intuitive alchemy system and nice flair of atmosphere. However there are a few things that will put off many gamers. Firstly, the combat system is absolutely dreadful. Many say that the combat is fast paced and enjoyable, but the simple fact is that it is shallow and unintuitive, with the only strategy taking the form of combat stances that either make the fight incredibly easy or impossible. Outside of combat, navigation is a bore with fairly generic environments and middle-of-the-road textures. The character models are constantly rehashed, to the point where the same person will show up in every town. At least five times. The animation quality is so lopsided that its sometimes difficult to tell which decade this game came out. In combat scenarios, Geralt has many high quality animations for his attacks in different stances, however, outside of combat the animation quality is lackluster at best. During cutscenes, characters often walk in slow motion when everything else is moving normally, constant speech animations are reused relentlessly and the animations of other elements of characters are just stupid, such as dwarven beards that have a penchant for jumping for joy whenever Geralt talks.While the main story is very well written and interesting, the sidequests are often no more that fetch quests that require you to run to and fro from areas you have already discovered. This is an example of clear presence of relentless padding and backtracking. As if that problem was not enough, many of The Witcher's quests are time-of-day dependant. This means that to begin and hand in most quests you have to find a campfire and rest until the quest is availible, which will also remove any buffs that you have applied to your character. The game has many problems and easily causes boredom, however a single playthrough is recommended, simply because it sets the stage for the far superior sequel. I give The withcer: Enhanced Edition a 6\\10"}

This game is a true master peice featuring beautiful scores and mind blowing sites.

This game has what you'd expect from a Professor Layton game; great story, great graphic and in general, great things that you expect in the series. It will grip you every time you solve a puzzle and the cutscenes are just magnificent. It has a long plot to keep you occupied every puzzle solved is another mystery unravelled.

Plays the game for 2 hours in Multiplayer. Raging because I died of cold. [All because I needed one more stone.] 15 minutes into finding my friend in the cold night. Its morning, builds a house. Lives in house. A strong man chases after me and my friend. We ran and hide in the forest. Staring at the man from behind a tree. He chases me. A wolf saves me by distracting the man. Escapes. Makes armour for friend and me, hunts the man down. Kills the man. Loots the man. Prosper in the game. Run out of wood. Its night time. Sees a boar. Hides in house cause I am \"Shadow fearful\". I hide in the house till my friend comes in. He asks for food. We go hunting for food. Remembers about the boar. Refuses to go out. My friend goes out. I check my inventory, alot of items in the vinicity. Looks like my friend's items. Screams in horror. Opens door.What happens? That is for you to find out.This game looks very promising. Although it is in early stages, I already find it better than alot of games. Although the combat does need improvement [Bows bows bows bows] but the game is VERY REALISTIC [Opinion Alert]. However, it is very rage inducing as very few items are given to you at the start. The world is so big that finding your friend takes HOURS. [Is this a compliment to saying the map is huge?]. I try to imagine the future multiplayer. Sleath take-downs on players/creatures. Walls for defending, playing rent for living in people's houses :3. Archer towers where I hire people to be archers on night shift with their bows, placable torches.
