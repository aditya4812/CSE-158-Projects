{"text": "This book was surprisingly good :) It started out a little stiff. The pace picking up as I went. The world building was pretty solid; I love Daine, though I do tend to picture her differently from the cover model. \n You know a book fits into high fantasy when it has a map at the front of it. Daine is thirteen, and alone. HEr and her horse, Cloud, are searching for their next home. Enter, Onua, A K'mir who instantly takes a liking to Daine. \n I can't wait to see what they will get up to next."}
{"text": "4 Mated Stars! \n Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy from Author \n Genre: MM Paranormal Romance \n My Blue Mountain Review ... \n Another great paranormal love story by Cardeno C. In this new series we have the blue mountain pack where the pack is led by the Alpha Frederick and helped with his twin brother and other Alpha Mitch. Here we find out that not all Alphas find their mate, because not all Alphas are able to deal with the responsibilites of the pack and their mate. But Mitch and Frederick have always known they were destined to have mates. More often than not Omegas and Alphas are mated but it is not often you find a male Omega. \n So when the pack stumbles across Simon on their territory and let the Alphas know that there is an unknown lone omega wolf on their mountain, for the first time Mitch gets hope that his mate has been found. Finding your mate doesn't always mean its going to be easy, especially when you mate is scared of his own skin and alphas in general. But Mitch doesn't give up easily so he has to give Simon time to trust him. \n Even though Simon's natural Omega instincts come to life around Mitch he fights it for a long time as he doesn't trust any alpha. Mitch has to be patient with Simon but the reward is worth it for this mated duo. \n Mitch the natural alpha wins my heart especially how he takes care of his mate Simob. Once again Cardeno C. has written a very lovely story about true love. So far I have loved every single story of Cardeno C. They are quick to read and jam packed with emotion and heart. \n For more reviews, visit Live Read and Breathe \n Like us on Facebook Live Read and Breathe Facebook \n Follow along with Twitter Live Read and Breathe Twitter"}

{"text": "3 stars \n I can't believe I'm going to say it but this fell short of the mark for me. There's no doubt that Nora can tell a story and paint pictures with words. I love all of her paranormal trilogies so far, but some aspects of this felt a bit recycled. \n The story didn't drag but it wasn't spectacular either as I had hoped. I loved the beginning introduction of Sorcha and her 3 children. It pulled me in instantly. After that, some things were too similar to Three Sisters Island, Key and Sign of Seven trilogies. The evil bad guy is slightly different, even though the power seeking is similar to every evil sorcerer written I suppose. The characters were likeable enough but I didn't feel strongly connected to them. \n Our heroine, Iona grew up knowing she didn't belong where she was. The only person who understood her was her Nan, who told her the history of Sorcha the Dark Witch. She decided to uproot and move to Ireland to find her connections. And there she did, with her cousins, Branna and Connor, who are also sister and brother. \n We're also introduced to Boyle, Finbar and Meara. There's strong friendships between all these characters that you can feel. The relationship between Iona and Boyle, however, didn't really spark any flames off the pages for me. I felt like I was told that they had a connection rather feeling it for myself. Usually my stomach or heart flutter and sigh for the H/h. It didn't happen here. It felt a little too rushed maybe as they did jump in feet first. Plus the conflict they had has been done before, and by Nora too no less. \n The connection between Branna and Fin reminds me of Mia and Sam from Three Sisters A LOT. Even though they are similar, I find myself more intrigued for their story than this one. \n The build up in the book focused on allowing Iona to learn and control her power. The fight wasn't all that dramatic and ended rather quickly, but this is only the first book after all. I hope there's more action and magic (between the H/h, too) in the next one. \n Steam: 1.5"}

{"text": "This is probably my favourite book in the whole series, from the cover to the content inside the pages!!! Im super impressed by Mead that she had written such a fantastic novel. So... a lot of stuff happens. Like life changing, plot changing stuff. After losing Mason, Rose starts feeling the affects of that and the fact she had killed 2 Strigoi. She starts seeing things she thinks is in her head. All it took was a plane ride for her to mentally implode. It definitely gives us, readers, and everyone accompanying Rose on the plane, a heart attack. Especially poor, worrying Dimitri. That is probably the 2nd most memorable scene that comes to mind when I think of the series as a whole. The 1st would have to be in Frostbite when Rose kills the 2 Strigoi in rage for killing Mason. The series really takes a dramatic role now and everything is happening at lightening speed. We get more of Adrian, now that he's enrolled at St. Vlad's to... chill? He's too old for classes, being 19 or 20, so he literally just joins to chill around and because he's bored. \n It seems to be a common theme with Mead, that at every end of her books, theres a huge shocking ending and cliffhanger. AGAIN Mead pulls that crap and we are left crying and screaming, \"NOOOOO!!!!\" \n ITS NOT FAIR MEAD, this is torture you're putting us through. Anyways, go read it. Shit happens. Bad shit. On the bright side, Rose and Dimitri finally succumb to their desires and at least they have a good time for awhile.. until all hell breaks loose :( \n IF you liked this review, check out moree on my blog ! \n http://keepcalmandloveboooks.blogspot.ca"}
{"text": "Crosspost: TheReadingBelle.com \n I received an ebook copy of this book via Netgalley, in exchange for an honest review. \n I have to say that The Night Parade has been one the most entertaining books that I have read for this month. I thought it was going to be young adult, but it is middle grade. I had so much fun reading this book!! \n This book reminded me of Spirited Away which is one of my favorite films when I was a young girl. In Spirited Away and in The Night Parade, both protagonists find themselves involved with the spirit world and with a quest to break a curse. \n Now going back to the book, I initially did not like Saki. I thought she was rude especially to her loving grandmother. As the book progressed, she grew on me since she started changing. She was a completely different person by the end of the book. I thought that she was courageous and more true to herself. I enjoyed her growth and it made this book far more enjoyable because of that. \n Overall, I loved her adventures in the spirit world! She had to endure a lot and I really liked her guides to help her on her journey. I loved the Japanese mythology in this book! One of my favorite characters from the spirit world is The Moonlight Prince, even though he is a minor character. What can I say, I happen to be a sucker for princes. \n What I really appreciated about this book is that it teaches us, the readers, that we should appreciate what's in front of us. We should try being more independent, instead of being too dependent on technology. For example, Saki was glued to her phone and hated the countryside. As the story goes on, she appreciates what she has around her. By the end, she fell in love with the countryside. Overall, this is positive book!! \n I would love for this book to be adapted into an animated film! I think if they were to adapt this book to a movie, the movie would be better. I really enjoyed reading this enchanting tale! I do recommend this book!! \n Final Rating: [?][?][?][?]"}

{"text": "See full review for The Glittering Court at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n When I saw Mead promoting this book on her Twitter I was a little curious. I love reading books that have to deal with regency and ladies of high birth masquerading and figuring out that their something more than their title, and I also love Mead's writing. I added it to my reading list and my friend - who's also a huge Mead fan - got to it before I did. She ended up not liking it all too much, and I was a little nervous. I gave it a go anyway and I can see what's going on."}
{"text": "Normalmente los libros de ciencia ficcion no aguanta muy bien el paso del tiempo y sin embargo este libro escrito en 1896 no pierde nada y podria haberse escrito, salvo por algunos detalles, actualmente. \n El tema principal del libro es la eterna confrontacion entre la etica o la moral y los metodos utilizados para para conseguir avances cientificos. Tambien se deja entrever una ligera critica a las religiones y como estas se usaban y usan para controlar a los pueblos menos desarrollados. \n El libro esta contado a modo de recuerdos y tiene una narrativa que te engancha, es muy agradable de leer manteniendo el suspense y la tension practicamente durante toda su lectura. \n Imprescindible para todo cientifico."}

{"text": "I am torn as we finish this next book in our chronological reading of the Chronicles of Narnia. On the one hand, my son and I loved the story. The horses, Bree with his pride and Hwin with her noble gentleness, the unexpected hero of Shasta, the toughness and transformation of Aravis, the vivid heat and color of Calormene, the rich mountains of Archenland, the longing for 'home' of Narnia and the glimpses into the Golden Age reign of the Pevensie children. All of this with the thrilling adventure of unknown adversaries, escapes, chases, betrayals, desert crossing, castle sieging, and Aslan's profound appearances and wise counsel \"I will only tell you your own story.\" \n Yet, there is something lacking. Is it any wonder that Lewis, so little exposed to female company in his early life, lacks vibrancy in his female characters? The high language in which the Pevensie's previously rather ordinary children speak is somewhat distracting and required editing for our student to understand. And then there are the clear Arabic/ Muslim tones of Calormene society and religious practice. The portrayal does smack of English superiority at points. Yet pondering this reinforced in my mind that the tension between Islam and countries claimed by it, and Christianity, and countries allied with it, is a long standing one that extends back centuries before September 11, 2001. \n In the end, this is a delightful story, that entertains and excites the imagination of children. While it is also an easy, amusing read for adults, the story contains deeper echoes of both the joys and challenges of our world. Looking forward to continuing the series!"}
{"text": "See full review for Dead Silence at: http://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.w... \n A common theme in all four books of this series is the secrets that Violet keeps. But it isn't really until this book that she realizes that she is keeping too many of them, and that her best friend in the whole world - Chelsea - is starting to get annoyed with them. Violet realizes it and doesn't know what to do about it on top of everything else. \n It's been a few months since Violet's kidnapping and she's trying to deal with living with her own imprint. Her friends are worried about her, but she doesn't know how to be around them with this imprint. She's taking more of the sleeping pills to dull the echo. But it isn't until her mother cleans out the attic and finds a box of her grandmother's old stuff that Violet finds a way to deal with the imprint and that there is something going on with her team."}
{"text": "See full review for The Orphan Queen at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n The Orphan Queen is the first for me. I've read plenty of fantasy books and I've read plenty of rebellion books and I've read plenty of both books combined. But this fantasy and rebellion book was different. You have your usual magic users, kings and queens, and successions and those trying to take back a kingdom. But the reason for the torn apart kingdoms was because of something called the wraith, which was born out of using magic. Huh. Interesting. \n Wilhelmina is the lost princess of the land of Aecor. Ten years ago, she was involved in the One Night War where the Indigo Kingdom attacked hers because her parents kidnapped the crown prince Tobiah. He saved her that night, while her parents were killed. Those other children who survived have gone on to form a group called the Ospreys that are trying to get Wil back to her throne. To do so they have a long plan that involves Wil and her friend Melanie infiltrating the Indigo Palace as refugees from a land that has already fallen to the wraith. But while there she can't complete her mission, not while she learns the truth about what really happened that night and what is out there that could save them all from the incoming wraith."}

{"text": "While the first book of The Infernal Devices series was thick and full of intricate information, Clockwork Prince was full of character. Curses, black magic, betrayal, friendship, and love is all intertwined as these brilliant characters' fight against the evil of The Magister, who wants the Shadowhunters to become extinct. \n I swear that I spent the last half of the book with my heart in my throat. My heart aches for Will and for Tessa, because of what they face now hurts just as much as it heals. Poor Tessa loves two parts of a whole--does one deserve more from her? Do either of them deserve eternity or will she spend those days after love has gone alone?"}
{"text": "The story of The Night Circus is the story of Celia and Marco, bound together at an early age and raised to play a game of magic that only one can win in order to prove a point between two men. The circus is the game and the acts pawns, caught up in a world of spells and illusions. Celia and Marco are unwilling participants, searching for a way to stop playing and survive. As they search they find each other and The Night Circus becomes a love story. \n As other reviews suggest, The Night Circus one of those books you will either love or hate. Personally, I loved it but can completely understand why it isn't everyone's cup of tea. I found that I needed to know what happened next and that I was really rooting for Celia and Marcus. At the same time, the game itself didn't completely make sense. In this, it was frustrating. I felt it was just beyond my reach. The main problem for me was that it's creators weren't strong enough characters in themselves. I didn't understand their motivation. For a first novel, however, and because I cared enough about everyone else, I was able to get past this issue. I also enjoyed the rich, detailed, descriptions. I felt I could see the circus. Again, though, this would not suit everyone as it involves a lot of fantasy. For those who enjoy such books, however, this is a jolly good read and highly recommended."}
{"text": "I read this in part because Felicia Day liked it and in part because I was looking for something to fill the void left by finishing The Dresden Files. I liked this. I probably would have given it 3.5 stars rather than 4 but since you can give half ratings I went up to 4. \n It was very noir, in a lot of ways. I think that what people who didn't like this book, didn't like, was that aspect of noir that's a bit corny but those of us who like the genre secretly love. Someone mentioned he kept referring to \"the Nightside\" over and over and I found this amusing the same way I'd find it amusing if he said that a dame walked into his office. It reads a little like Sin City, in that way. \n It's definitely not the same caliber as Dresden Files but it read so quickly and I enjoyed the world the author created so I will definitely be continuing with the series for now."}
{"text": "Every book in Lindsay Buroker's Emperor's Edge series is a delight. Protagonist Amaranthe shows courage as she leads her motley team in defense of the deposed Emperor. Buroker's characters are well rounded, consistent and complement each other. One of the ways we get to know the main characters better is that each book comes from the point of view of a different member of the team, in this case Maldynado. I love getting to know all the members well, as the whole story becomes more involving and more exciting. The steampunk world and the politics of power-mongering become clearer as the stories progress. Action and reflection balance and ground the plot, and the pacing is just right. As well, the romance between Amaranthe and the Assassin shows up just enough to twig our interest but does not take over the whole story, and this love relationships moves through reasonable and heart-warming developments as time goes on. I heartily recommend this book and the entire series to those who love a good story and care about the clash of good and evil."}
{"text": "This is quite possibly the worst book I've read recently. I read 100 pages and I was so confused. Kids pretending to be others but thinking back to a script that they made and there were people who were playing on person but not someone in this part of the story. I gave up. \n As the one reviewer said, it was a like a private joke that we weren't in on. As far as it being Narnia it's far from it, the whole idea would have been great but it's not anything like a Narnia. Great writer you aren't."}

I didn't really care for book one because it lagged and the court politics went over my head a lot of the time. Book two was slightly better with more action, but the whole 'vision' thing that Kelsea experienced was sort of trippy. Book 3 is the same. The constant back and forth between the members of Kelsea's court, Kelsea herself, the Red Queen, and Kelsea's visions of Katie from post-crossing gets a little crazy. While the action does pick up and there aren't really any places where The Fate of the Tearling lags, I'm still a little bit mystified."}

{"text": "Everyone always says that Katie's books make them laugh. They will, but while there are situations that you will embarrass yourself in a public with shouts of laughter there is an excellent plot that makes you want to stay up reading 'just one more page' until you've finished. There are many paranormal romance writers who treat the subject with some somber, dark emotions. Don't get me wrong I've read those too but there is just something about a 'leading man' with a blow-up sheep. Ramona wasn't the only thing that had tears of laughter rolling down my cheeks, add to her and her stockings Twatter, ladyplant, talking heads in gerbil balls, Bowling with Gary, and sex toys shaped like a U, and I was pretty much gasping for air during many chapters. All of that though only enhanced the storyline, gave Bee and Constantine some personality; Connie needed something to keep him from seeming to be smug and unapproachable and the outstanding secondary characters Katie wove into the tale were able to show Constantine's kind but stubborn Wyvern's heart. I even found myself accepting and even liking Bee from Dragon Fall once I had the chance to really 'get to know her'. The story twisted and turned in ways I never expected. Bee and Constantine worked through every amusing and adventurous situation they found themselves in proving a positive outlook can in fact win the day. A wonderful story with a couple that were truly fated to be together and I love every minute of it!"}

{"text": "The Hereafter features Nin and Dylan, two teens who find themselves dead. Neither of them have memories of their deaths. Nin 'awakes' at peace--on a beach and in a seemingly idyllic place. Dylan find himself dead in a dumpster--disaffected and angry and bitter. At first, Nin and Dylan seem like they can't be different people. \n This story plays with memories, which I love. There's an insubstantial quality to the Hereafter, which alternates with 'Before' chapters. Boucher's flowing, wispy prose aids to this atmosphere and lends itself best to Nin's chapters and character. Nin and Dylan piece together their memories, showing that Nin's life wasn't so peaceful after all. The mysteries of both Nin and Dylan's lives are all in their memories, which kind of leaves the current story in the Hereafter feeling a little thin on stakes. That's personal opinion, though, and if you're okay with stories that are less action-packed, most of the momentum of the story taking place in Dylan and Nin's memories will probably work better for you than it did for me. \n A romance taking place in the afterlife...it's kind of odd and yet sweet. Boucher's writing sells the sweet romance aspect of this, and what initially attracted me to this book was the idea of how this type of afterlife romance would develop. Dylan and Nin bond over their problems, and Dylan opens up to Nin about his frankly shitting life. This drives Dylan away from Nin, but she has her own problems when she begins to remember her old boyfriend and Mrs. Frost. Both of these characters are intensely sympathetic...which was a bit boring to me? If you like commentary romance and contemporary YA, I think this story will work better for you than it did for me. \n I don't want to ruin the big twist in the story, but it did deliver. This story is 100% raw emotion and driven by the character's feelings. There's an underlying theme of forgiveness and atonement in the afterlife, which becomes pronounced the more the story progresses. There's a fluidity to this story and a non-linear aspect to it that's enchanting. It reminded me a bit of Everyday, which I really liked."}

{"text": "This book started off terribly for me. Probably because I'm a mood reader, and I guess I just wasn't at all in the mood for the raging bitchy rudeness that is Anita Blake. She honestly has no redeeming qualities. I LIKE unlikable characters and villains. But Anita is just a straight-up nasty person. She does nothing but storm around, treating everyone like shit when they have done nothing to deserve that treatment, demands that she be treated with the utmost respect (God help you if you call her Miss), and even struts around a high school, smugly thinking to herself how much hotter she is than these HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS. Who does that?! \n Anyway, the book did pick up for me once the story got moving. I was glad to have a change of scenery, even though the plot remained terribly formulaic. But, the werewolf-vampire love triangle took a backseat, which I was very happy about. Larry was the best character in this book -- he seems like a genuine guy, he can be kick-ass when he tries, and he's willing to learn. I just sincerely hope Anita doesn't ruin him and turn Larry into a mini-me. \n I need to mention the writing. It's pretty atrocious. The book is so filled with action sequences, but Hamilton does not write these scenes well. I find that very few authors can write long fight scenes where you can easily picture what is going on. In nearly every action scene in this book, I couldn't keep up with who got hurt/killed and by whom, who was wielding what weapon, etc. It's always just a jumbled mess to me. On a totally opposite note, I felt like in this book Hamilton was trying to write...better? There were sentences that seemed like they were meant to be poetic or something, but that just made no sense in reality and I was left rereading these parts several times before I understood what she was trying to say. \n In conclusion, the best part of this book was when Anita licked Jean Claude's nipple. Lollollollollol."}
{"text": "\"Once - long ago and for millennia before that - we had been slaves to High Fae overlords. Once, we had built them glorious, sprawling civilizations from blood and sweat, built them temples to their feral gods. Once, we had rebelled, across every land and territory. The War had been so bloody, so destructive, that it took six mortal queens crafting the Treaty for the slaughter to ease on both sides and for the wall to be constructed: the North of our world conceded to the High Fae and faeries, who took their magic with them; the South to we cowering mortals, forever forced o scratch out a living from the earth.\" \n With ACoTaR I pooped my Sarah J. Maas cherry. It's actually ironic because I bought all her Throne of Glass series as paperback already and bought her follow-up, A Court of Mist and Fury, without having read a single word of hers - yup, I had some faith in this author. \n That being said, I barely remember what the blurb said about the book when I decided I start reading it, I was simply fascinated with the cover and thought I've to finally start this series because EVERYONE is raving about. I read this book in two days and took it everywhere with me - I was that fascinated by the world Sarah created. \n I'm a huge fantasy fan, in my opinion, it gives books a special twist that makes my bookworm heart skip a beat. \n Feyre, a young girl that had to grow up way too fast, had to see and feel so much cruelty in her young age, committed a crime she didn't know was a crime. Killing a fae, which was disguised as a wolf. Despite her hate for the fae she killed him (unknowingly) in order to feed and provide for her family. As a result, a High Lord of the Fae came to claim her, because she has to pay her debt for killing a faerie - he took Feyre to the South, away from her family, her misery. \n That's when the story really begins. \n I've to admit the beginning dragged a bit and I played with the thought to DNF but I didn' want to give up - not just because everyone told me how awesome this story is - but I wanted to trust my instinct that this series got to be fantastic. \n AND I WAS RIGHT!! \n Omg, the slow build-up between Feyre and Tamlin was great. Both warmed up to each other and Feyre finally got live a life she deserved. Tamlin showed her a new world; a world that she thought was cruel to humans but his home was everything but that. Both couldn't deny their growing feelings anymore ....until SHE came and ripped their happiness apart. \n \"Because I was human, and I would grow old and - I didn't let myself get that far as he came closer still. Slowly, as if giving me time to pull away, he brushed his lips against my cheek. Soft and warm and heartbreakingly gentle.\" \n The last few chapters gave me almost a heart attack. If you enjoy romantic fantasies than check out this series - a love that goes beyond, a love that makes your heart beat faster, a love that is like no other. \n ___________________________________ \n Read all my reviews (A-Z) on the blog \n Like the blog on Facebook \n Email subscription to my blog"}

Who are a little bit angry and a lot funny and smart? \n Not many. \n Which is why this book was my jam growing up. Meg Murry is the heroine I needed as a child, and though she ultimately defeats IT with love. Really? Love? Not that volcano of super rage I felt beneath the surface? Whatever l'Engle. It's your book. You do you, you crazy snowflake I loved it. \n Rereading it as an adult, though....Was there always all of this religion mixed in with my precious science and math? Was it necessary to bring it in? And did it add to the plot in anyway? \n Adding in the religion seemed heavy-handed, bogged down the plot with precious pages that could have been better spent exploring Aunt Beast or developing Calvin as a character, and continually pulled me out of the story. \n Still, ten-year-old me cannot give this book anything less than four stars. Ultimately, still one of the most entertaining reads I had a child, and one of the reasons I became deeply interested in the sciences. Worth reading. \n Just with a grain of salt."}

{"text": "So I'm having a hard time reviewing this book, at times it was a little slow and then at times it was really good. I think the history part of it kind of bored me a bit, but not to the point to stop reading. I loved all the romance, action, and drama that goes on and found myself wanting to read more during those parts. \n The romance between Diana and Matthew is great, even though it was forbidden and had serious consequences, you just couldn't help but want them to be together. I really fell for Matthew, I mean come on, who wouldn't want a very sexy, hot vampire loving and protecting you? At least that is how I pictured him to be in my head. \n I'm definitely going to read the second book in this series to see how everything plays out!"}
{"text": "I love Marchetta. I mean, love. I still think that Finnikin of the Rock is the most perfect book EVER written. \n As a story, Froi of the Exiles isn't up to par. It's as though by trying to define madness, Marchetta loses her grip of the character development. Don't get me wrong. This book is FAR better than MOST I've read. Marchetta is a skillful, fantastic author. \n However. \n Froi of the Exiles made me angry. Very angry. In this book, the story doesn't really end. It leaves a plethora of loose threads, hanging endings. \n I resent when authors simply stop a story, whether it's because they're out of room or their publishers are wanting to hook people into buying the next volume. I bought Froi on its Kindle release date on the strength of the writing in Finnikin - and the ending of Finnikin feels satisfying, a story tied up, if not completely, at least enough that I didn't want to throw myself off a balcony for not knowing what was next."}
{"text": "Wow, never have I read a book that started so strong to fall so, so flat in the last 50 pages. Starts of really great with this whole Atlantis vibe, then it gets weird with the whole no crying thing. it really derails though with the whole possession and try to make the girl cry stuff. Seriously such a garbage book, and the main character is such a raging bitch. \n All in all, i would very much like to have this book scrubbed from my mind. Except for a lingering feeling of never read that again. So disappointing to feel like that about a book that started so strong."}

The story is very fantastic, formidable, and meaningful. \n Veronica has a courageous writing styles. That's the reason why I love her books. (especially after reading Allegiant) \n All the world in the story is fictional, so it means that there's a long way for us to be familiar with the brand new fresh world. At first, it might makes us feel a little bit impatient. However, while passing through it, we will find out that the story is really awesome!!! \n Characters are the most attractive element that make me keep reading on it. \n The relationship between Cyra and Akos is so remarkable. And I ship them so so so so so so much!!! \n (Still have lots of feelings to tell actually. \n Maybe I will write it down after having a sleep. LOL)"}

{"text": "3 stars \n I have a great interest while reading the introduction from the book. And I do like it with its fantastic topic and particular story line. The Blue Moon Narthex reminds me the adventures of Harry Potter and Percy Jackson. (Also, it reminds me one of my favorite series, The 39 Clues. ) \n As a middle grade story, it's a very talented work. Each plots like a piece of puzzle put the truth and exciting exploration together. However, maybe it's because that there are lots of mysterious things happen so suddenly, making it need to slow down the paces to unveil all the secrets hidden from Cole's dad. That's the reason why I only give it only 3 stars. \n Nevertheless, it's still worthy to be patient as getting through the beginning of the book. After passing through those slow-pace plots, everything is being more exciting than I can imagine. \n Receive ARC from NetGalley to exchange for the honest review."}
{"text": "See full review for Horizon at: http://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.w... \n I'll admit that after book 2, I was a little wary of this series. I mean, how can you top the death of not only the main character but the one that she loves as well? The answer, you really can't. I mean, yes, the other two books were good, but they were kind of a let down after book 2. \n With Horizon you got the same set up as you did in Mystic - different POVs with each chapter and I really wished that that wasn't the case. The constant jumping of character's POVs broke up the story and I couldn't really get into a constant groove with it. Not to mention the plot was a little bit lacking, I mean, you have this huge buildup of what Daire and the others have been up to since the last book and what they're planning on doing, but all of a sudden it's like wham, bam, climax! Uh...okay?"}

During a stormy night Evie finds herself taken from everything she knows.

{"text": "4.5 stars \n What an intense ride! If this was a movie, I don't think I could loosen my grip on the armrest and my arm would be sore after. If I could say one thing to sum up the book, it'd be coming round full circles, especially for John, Xhex and Darius. \n I loved John Matthew the first time he was introduced. He had that innocent and gentle way about him. Xhex is a hard core kickass heroine, one I would not want to mess with after seeing her assassination skills. \n John and Xhex was drawn to one another when they first laid eyes on each other in ZeroSum. They were indeed meant for each other. They both have a pretty brutal past and issues they have to overcome. \n \"You're not half the male you could be because of what was done to you. You're twice what anyone else is because you survived.\" \n The beauty of the relationship is seeing them hold each other up in this book. John was such a wonderful hero. He didn't disappoint me in the least. Xhex was pretty clear she didn't deserve a happy ending but when you have someone such as John in your life, it's hard not to second guess your decision. \n The flashbacks to Darius connected the dots and the strands of life that are intertwined. The few surprises here and there with the Chosen and Payne kept things interesting. The paranormal investigators bits made me scratch my head a little. Yes, the identity of who they found was revealed but is there a significance to it? Or is it just filler? \n What broke my heart in this is the distance between Blay and Qhuinn. I just want their HEA. I know I'll get there but it seems forever away! \n There's more development on Lash, I was actually kind of creeped out at one point. Such evil evil power. \n Overall, I really enjoyed this, it kept me flipping pages to find out what's happening next."}

{"text": "I like the new perspective. I dunno, I kinda see how people don't like him sneaking into her room, but I think that fact has already been covered. He's not a normal teenage boy. The vampires seem to be a little bit more in every way.... stronger, more beautiful, more inclined to act out emotionally.... Plus, if this were any other teen romance, nobody would care. It's just the author's way of describing his inability to be away from her, and since we know that Bella practically moves into failure to thrive without Edward, I'd say it's safe to say they have the similar issues. \n I really like knowing the perspectives of the vampires. It'd be nice if she got into Edward's struggle to not eat or rape Bella when he's making out with her- it sounds like that's the direction she's going in with it being just as burning as the thirst.... \n Finish it already!!

{"text": "Bound by Prophecy is the third installment in the Bound series by Stormy Smith. Like its predecessor, it picks up where the second book left off - straight into the action. \n Amelia had fallen into a kind of coma after the battle at Cresthaven and Aidan could only reach her in his animal form. \n I felt that I could have used a quick reminder or short summary of what happened in the previous books, even though I read them, but unlike the other two which I read almost simultaneously, there were several months between the second and third books. \n Bound by Prophecy is more focused on Aidan and Amelia's relationship, which means there is more romance than the previous books. It's still a clean novel, but I sometimes felt I needed less holding hands and kissing and more moving forward with the plot, which has several twists and turns that I doubt anyone saw coming. \n \"His fear washed over me like the first swim of summer, the water like ice until you're fully submerged.\" \n Quick-paced, the novel shifts between three perspectives this time, namely: Amelia's, Aidan's and Micah's. We also get to see the characters from book two more in-depth, especially Baleon and Micah. \n When the characters started travelling, I got confused, especially since there was Cresthaven and Syria. What was in Syria and how did they know? This part was a big question mark for me especially since I didn't remember it being mentioned in the second book - it could have been there but my memory fails me. Also, why is their home in Syria not Cresthaven? \n There were several instances in the novel that I felt Amelia was selfish, which is understandable and an important aspect in her character as a to-be leader, still sometimes I felt it was a bit much. \n There is also a lot of speculation as to Amelia's powers and her Keeper power, which has been a bit of a vague subject since the first book. \n \"I'm not part of some destiny or prophecy. What I am is a curse.\" \n One of the most likeable characters in all three books is Amelia's best friend Bethany, AKA \"B\". Her character is light, funny and sometimes the voice of reason. One of my favourite quotes was when she was reprimanding Amelia. \n \"Do you know what that means, Miss 'nobody likes me, I should go eat worms'? That means he doesn't hold it against you. And if he doesn't hold it against you, you damn well can't hold it against yourself.\" \n There is also the strained relationship between Micah and Bethany, who dated briefly before Amelia was forced to be with Micah (end of book 1 & most of book 2). Still there were some indications of hope. \n \"Micah walked slowly toward Bethany, as cautious as a zookeeper approaching a big cat, and likely for a good reason.\" \n Bound by Prophecy is filled with beautiful quotes and speeches by a variety of characters. \n Here Cole tells Amelia about their father's choices: \n \"He looked at me, and said, 'Cole, there are times when you have to rip your own heart out to show it how to beat.' I thought he was crazy, but I get it now. We were his heart. And what he had to do to us tore him up, but we had to learn how to beat alone.\" \n One of the characters that develops significantly in Bound by Prophecy is Micah, who moves from a prince put down by his mother to a strong leader. \n The parts narrated from his viewpoint are interesting, quick and calculated. He doesn't have time to lose and the character development is clear. His speeches were among the best in the novel. Below is the confrontation scene between him and his mother, Queen Julia. \n \"Power is held by those who take it. It is kept by those who wield it unflinchingly. It is earned by those who are willing to compromise anything to achieve their purpose.\" \n \"No mother,\" I interjected, \"that is where you are the one who has it wrong. Power is earned by those refuse to compromise their ideals and beliefs. It is kept by those who put the greater good before themselves. It is held by those who are supported and believed in. Power is merely having the resources to accomplish your objectives, and it is fleeting to those who throw people away like garbage when they don't conform. \n \"Power is celebrated and revered by those who benefit from it,\" I continued. \"You have maintained your power through coercion and fear, and that is why you are dying. You couldn't sustain your power because it was never meant for this purpose. You are dying because your life is not worth the air you need to breathe. You're dying because you are evil in the world needs rid of you.\" \n Although Bound by Prophecy was not my favourite book in the series, I enjoyed the first and second books more, it still earns a 3.5-star rating and is an interesting, fast-paced conclusion to the series - which Stormy Smith has said she might write new books using other characters \n Note: I know this review is long overdue - I finished the book in time but I did not have time to write the review. My apologies for the delay. \n Note II: I received a free copy of Bound by Prophecy from the author and as part of a blog tour in exchange for an honest review."}

{"text": "Really a 3.5 stars \n To be honest, I wanted to hate this book from the start. I can't stand following the crowd with books. Another thing that threw me off was my younger sister read it first, and I hate that she knows what happens before me. \n Anyway, despite those qualms, it did take me quite a bit to actually get into enjoying the novel. The first half was too slow paced for my taste, but the description was lovely. After reaching a little over half of the book I couldn't put it down, and was stunned by the sudden increase in pace as well as the additions to plot. \n The twists in this book left me stunned. I saw one coming, but out of the multitude of them all, that was nothing. Those twists left me with a book hangover, that I'm now experiencing, and can't believe that's what took place. If you love dramatic changes in events throughout a book, and I'm guessing series, this is a romance you'd want to follow."}
{"text": "For twenty-one year-old Gemma, life has been nothing short of a little weird. Living a life of nothing more than a shell, emotionless, and just getting by her world is turned upside down by a single moment of emotion. From there she is over taken by emotion after emotion making life confusing and complicated as she adjusts to the changes she is experiencing. \n Then she meets Alex, who she is undeniably attracted to but his arrogance and secretiveness leaves Gemma confused in her feeling for him. Yet she still is pulled by an invisible connection from past dreams and nightmare and a overall feeling that there is something important that exists between them \n As secrets about her past unravel, Gemma's life becomes threatened. She needs to figure out what's going on, before she winds up dead. But the only person she can turn to for answers is the one person she isn't sure she can trust. \n SO, I have read the YA version to this series Fallen Star and I loved it then, so of course I love Shattered Promises. The story is basically the same only all the characters are college age, and the intensity that Alex and Gemma share is far more intimate. Every time Gemma experiences a new emotion this time it seems like lust is accompanying it. The girl is a raging ball of hormones that needs release. I think that allowing the characters to be older and more intimate will open up many different avenues for the future book series. Her relationship with Alex can only get more complicated with all the sexual frustration added to their teetering relationship. Her relationship with Laylen teeters on a want and a true friendship. I still was just as intrigued by the new version as I was the old Version of this series. \n The story is different and introduces all sorts of different characters. Even though I have basically read it before I was still just as engorged in the story waiting for the next twist in the story. The edgier version leaves you even more on the edge of your seat because the scenes are so much more intense, or it seems that way. Overall the book is intriguing, suspenseful, full of mystery and action, and NOW a whole lot more intimate leaving you all hot and bothered."}

{"text": "Digging into this book for the first time after the series ended, I was reminded how much I love its increasing character development and storyline. This was the first Potter book I ever read (having seen the first movie, stupidly, I raced on to the second book to see what happened next! then forced myself to start at the beginning) and it's still one of my favorite plots. It's also the creepiest of the books -- how could it not be, with an unseen terror lurking in Hogwarts that only Harry can hear? And how could you not love some of Rowling's new characters, like Moaning Myrtle? \n Reaching the end of this book is both sobering (since it's so much fun) and exciting, since next up in the franchise is my favorite book!"}
{"text": "I was surprised by how much I liked this book. The first 20 or so pages I was little hesitant to keep reading the book. But after that it picked up and I couldn't put it down. I kept wondering what was going to happen or what adventure was going to happen. \n We all know that \"the boy\" is Peter Pan. But he isn't the main main character which was great. I loved that there were old characters and new ones mixed in it. \n The way the story is told, as if it's a story teller telling you the story was a great way to tell the story. Sometimes at times it got really wordy, but overall I felt it was a new and interesting way to tell the story. It was change from all the other ways that fantasy stories are told. \n I did like the change in fantasy. As most books now are Harry Potterish, it was a relief to see someone trying something new in the terms of books. \n The one slight problem I had with this book was the naming of the Indians. I felt it was a little, off. I know it was for humor but I just felt that names such as \"Dog Licking Self\" was a little offensive. And the name kept coming up. That was my only real problem with the book. Oh and the fact that NONE of the Indians knew how to speak proper English, then again this is the Boy's world so maybe that's how he wanted it."}

Tell me. \n As always the world building was brilliant, and the characters were so memorable that I slipped right into it. I absolutely adored Cress and Thorne in this one. the relationship was highly realistic considering the whole satellite aspect. And his being tongue tied around her was a little corny but it did get the point across. Please, please tell me that we get to see Cinder and Kai get married in some anthology or other. \n And, finally, I am actually now curious to read Levana's story. I want to know more about Channary and whether she really was as awful as all that. And, if so, where the hell did Cinder get her awesomeness from."}
{"text": "This novel contains moments of intelligence and pathos, biting commentary on religion, modern society and the like, and times where the action sparks or the story takes on a cool old-fashioned 50's monster movie vibe. Unfortunately, there are also moments of jarringly awkward writing, blunt descriptions of sexual encounters, bowel movements and vivid scenes of carnage- and that's not as much fun as it sounds ;) \n All told, my enjoyment of this novel vacillated wildly, and in my opinion barely made it to three stars.

He totally neglects Cormia which is not cool. I felt incredibly sorry for Cormia; she was forced to move out of the only home she knew to mate with a total stranger. She might have seemed weak in the first quarter of the book, but gradually she grew stronger and stronger. I liked her a lot. \n I love how Ward always includes a second love story (or the hints of one) in the storyline. It wasn't just Cormia and Phury, there was also John and Xhex. There are chapters dedicated to Zsadist and Bella, which makes me thankful because they're one of my favourite couples. \n So Lover Enshrined might not have reached the standards of the previous five books but it was still extremely riveting.

{"text": "The only thing that I liked about Dead Ever After, the final book of Southern Vampire Mysteries, was the prologue. It was the only part of this book which reminded me of the good old days when Charlaine Harris wrote memorable dialogue lines and her characters exhibited a sense of humour. She also introduced an interesting refined villain, a devil. The prologue raised some expectations that this new character would make some interesting action later on, the expectation entirely unfulfilled, as he made no further appearances in the book. \n The rest of the book is totally predictable, lacklustre and disappointing to many fans of this book series. They were, however, forewarned in the past that Sookie would not be turned and not end up with a vampire, so no surprises here. Especially that she had already shown her fans that she didn't care about their preferences in Dead and Gone, the other book of this series that brought the equal disappointment to many of her readers. For me the biggest disappointment after reading the complete 13 novel series, is the fact that from liking greatly the protagonists of this series, I finish reading the series with the characters I don't like or even care about their fate. Sad, really."}

The male main character comments on this so it might be that at some point it's 'explained', oth the werewolf alpha male who is regularly raping him seems to think it's funny that humans object to their females and males being separated (their females being considered no threat, unlike the rebels, who are all male, it's assumed by context). \n Second, since it's a dual POV, we know almost from the beginning Aaron is not responsible for the crime he's accused of, but he never SAYS anything. Supposedly it's to keep his cover with the rebels, but now again, he's in private with the most powerful man in the country/area, who wants something FROM him. Aaron isn't even really a rebel or opposed to the wolves, just to submission in general, so it wouldn't betray any of his principles (and it might actually help him find the person he's looking for) to ask for Quinn's help. But maybe it goes back to the point that the guy is happy to enslave, force body modifications and rape him before he's even healed from those. \n Third, Alpha Asshole insists he wouldn't force his slave to have sex with him. Instead he'll lick him, werewolf saliva proving an irresistible aphrodisiac (possibly just for that wolf's mate, not super clear). Now, drugging someone so they can't refuse to have sex with you IS RAPE. I do not object to noncon per se, and this fantasy so whatever, but I felt like this was somehow presented as a real moral justification and just, personally, weirded me out. Particularly because I thought the idea of two alpha guys pushing at each other was really hot, and Aaron is not an alpha guy by any standard."}

I didn't particularly like the audiobook reader but I loved the narrator wasn't a native English speaker, it really worked for a story set in ancient Poland, I thought.

{"text": "Miriam Black lives a dark and dangerous life. As this book opens, she is giving normal a try but its not going well. Miriam is living in a rundown trailer in a rundown trailer park while working a dreary retail job in a rundown store. And this is as good as things get for our heroine. Miriam's gift (or curse) is the ability to see the moment of a person's death if she touches their skin. Even wearing gloves won't spare her from horrific visions and hallucinations. Miriam has recently decided to use her ability to try to change fate and save the innocents. That might mean killing the guilty but the piper must be paid. In this book, Miriam is hunting a serial killer who kidnaps, tortures and murders teenage girls. This puts her in many a perilous situation and I lost count of how many times she herself is beaten and abused by sadistic attackers. If one thing is certain, its that normal is not in the cards for Miriam Black."}
{"text": "Evie is half human and half angel, created to be the first angel with a soul. She is a sweet morsel that too many creatures want to drink, consume, love or kill. She has a soul mate, an aspire, an undead King and a guardian angel that all would like to claim her as their own. Her biggest obstacle could be the very man who started it all, her father. \n These characters have such strong bonds that I found myself just as torn as Evie about who I needed her to end up with. Introducing new interests and twists just made life more complicated for her and knowing who to trust, almost impossible. Ending on a sweet, but ominous note means that there will be another addition to the series. I'm really hoping it's in the works!"}

{"text": "Jaevid is a half-elf, half-human that's sent to live with this biological human father, Ulric, who makes saddles for dragon riders. Fledgling, especially early on, goes quickly into How to Train Your Dragon territory. Jaevid is basically Elven Hiccup. If this is the How to Train Your Dragon novelization, I'm okay with that (I loved that movie). \n The story is a little slow. Not in terms of action, but Jaevid's internal monologue doesn't quite feel right. The writerly part of my brain started to whisper \"passive voice and gerunds...too much passive voice and gerunds...\" This pattern of writing makes Jeavid feel like a boring character, even though I've got a solid idea of him as a person being that he's a shy fifteen year old. He's a bit more introspective, but there were parts that I started to skim because there was too much passive vs. active voice. \n Felix is a weird character for me. I like him, but his personality--what we're told and what we see--is a bit incongruous. Felix at once feels too mature and understanding, and yet, he does the silly 'don't tell me the clearly important information you have' shtick. He's also a huge goof-ball when it comes to the other students and girls. As I said, I liked him, but he feels a bit hard to pin down. \n The dragons don't have much personality, which is a bit of a shame. (Note: This gets better in Avian, but I want to talk about it in Fledgling, first.) Mavrik feels like an animal here, which is good, but this novel begs for the How to Train Your Dragon comparison. Toothless feels distinct as an animal with a personality, but Mavrik is a bit more of plot prop in this novel. He's an animal, which is good, but he lacks the quirky behaviors normal animals exhibit. Once again, this gets better, but this is where Mavrik's character stands for me in Fledgling. \n There's a lot of little, incongruous details in this story that felt silly to me. There are 9 fledglings and yet, a 100 trainees? That's a very lopsided class size (years 1 and years 2 only were mentioned as being dragon riders). Once again, this is fixed and explained in Avian, but it left me scratching my head in Fledgling. They also jump on the back of a dragon...a dragon that has spines! And live. The slavers didn't notice their prisoners run free? There was a lot of these little things, which added up for me, and even impacted the enjoyable moments of the book. \n There are several times in the story where the mentor, Sile, has to be saved by Jae and Felix. It feels a bit repetitive, but it establishes that there's a faction out for his life and that they're connected to the crown. I liked Sile, but he doesn't explain nearly enough of the major backstory to satisfy me. This is purposeful, but it does obscure his motivations. \n MYTH TWIST! There's a little surprise and added mythology after Felix and Jaevid are captured. This isn't the dragon version of Hogwarts, and I expected the climax to take place at the school, which it doesn't. This is a welcomed surprise and hooked me into the end of the story. The conclusion of the plot felt a bit too convenient. This is a continuing series, and there's certainly more in the world and series. This book has the easy, MG feel of Eragon without the fiddly prose, but the obvious comparison is How to Train Your Dragon. The middle of the story diverts it away from what I expected, which elevated this book (and other novels in the series) for me."}

{"text": "Having been bored to tears by some recent YA fiction (coughDIVERGENTcough), I put off reading this book for a very longtime. But I was actually incredibly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Having the narrator be a male seemed an interesting choice in a field dominated by female-centric fiction... and it also seemed rather ingenious. Instead of reading about Bella lusting after Edward, why not let young women read a novel in which the guy is the one doing the fawning? Isn't the whole point of escapism to want to BE the person whom someone desires? While the countdown to the big birthday seemed to go on a little long, and the ending was a bit more pat than I might have liked, I will (eventually) get around to reading the next book in the series... which is more than I can say for Divergent."}

Since I have visited Disney World more than once, I enjoyed reading about the places that I had visited and enjoyed. Most of the plot occurred in Animal Kingdom and it was an interesting read. Highly recommended for the middle school reader."}

{"text": "My sci-fi/fantasy consigliare (especially of free stuff), pointed out this freebee, when I told him about Priest's new book, Dreadnaught. I know it's a short story, but, I dunno, I found it lacking in substance. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but I really hope the rest of her stuff is a little more dense (I can only assume that it is, as she's nominated for the Hugo, and what not ... and I should have started out there). \n That's the only really negative thing I have to say. \n Now, the postivie is that it's pretty f'n creepy. You know as a kid, how you would have a stuffed animal, or toy, and you would swear that it moved ... kinda like the clown in poltergeist? THAT, is what this story does well. Not only that, Priest does a really good job in building sympathetic characters ... especially in Edwin, and the mentally enfeebled doctor he cares for. \n I would hold off reading it (if you can), until later in October, especially if you're into horror, or spooky stuff."}
{"text": "I found this book intriguing from the beginning. I thought that as it went on it became more intriguing and I wanted to keep reading to see what would happen with the characters.

However, I can say it was the site of a great triumph, in that it is the first book this student ever finished that he didn't thoroughly enjoy - a victory of self-discipline! \n The adaptation is good, as is the rest of this series, it was simply the story that didn't happen to entice us."}
{"text": "I hated this book. Timothy was a terrible child that no one could like. His attitude was beyond bad, it was out of character. \n The fact that the author threw in characters from a previous book just to make a sequel didn't help. \n Oh and don't forget that the adults acted like they were braindead uncaring people. \n Sometimes it felt like the author tried to make her writing whitty or smart alicky to get the kids to like it but it turned readers off because it felt like a back talking teenager."}
{"text": "I spent my formative childhood years trying to turn my bedroom light on and off by invoking magic or paranormal forces alone, so naturally I feel well qualified to pass judgement on Raymond Feist's Riftwar Saga. \n A classic mix of underdog characters who come good, in a big way. Why hasn't my life followed a similar meteoric rise :o \n The whole story unfolds in a really entertaining way. I read this as a teen originally, returning back for nostalgic reasons as an adult. It was still a really enjoyable read and I really enjoy most of the author's work. Perhaps like a lot of fantasy, the characters tend to be clearly good or bad but I wouldn't say the story suffers for that. More recent similar genre books, such as Trudi Canavan's Black Magician series, have arguably more complex, lifelike characters featuring throughout. That said, I think the scale of the Riftwar Saga makes it a great read for lovers of fantasy. Some of the scenes involving Pug on the alternate World Tsuruan are superb. (Note to self - never, ever annoy a magician :s) It would be great to see something like this or Trudi's books made into films - they would be so much better than some that make the transition I am sure."}

{"text": "Sweet Ruin features two new characters, Rune and Josephine, rather than continuing on with existing characters. Although Thad and Nix are in the story, no other continuing characters are really involved, but rather new secondary characters. This helps build the upcoming Ascension, as well as outlines the Morior and their role in the Ascensions of the past and current. \n Dark Fey...poisonous to all those who come in contact with his blood, Rune is half fey and half demon. Rune struggles to keep his past in the past, but never truly left if behind. Ever loyal to the leader of Morior (Orion), Rune sets out on his new mission to kill Nix. As an archer and dealer in secrets he is the best for the job. At times I found Rune likeable, but overall I was not sold on his character. \n 'Dead and dead', Josephine is a new breed in which we have only had minimal contact with...she is Thad's older sister. Age eight, Josephine and Thaddius (infant), wandered the streets. Jo's character is brash and she can't seem to stay out of trouble. Which leads to the fated day, she had to let Thad go. Jo tells it like it is and doesn't really ever become a likeable character and at times comes off as whiny. \n Crossing paths and destined to be fated, Rune and Josephine struggle with their growing relationship and 'saving' Thad. I started reading the series this summer, so I am pretty familiar with the other stories. I can say, however, I was not as impressed by this story as the others. Overall the story was good, but I feel within the series there are others that far surpass Sweet Ruin. Looking forward to seeing where the story goes now that the Morior are revealed. I received Sweet Ruin via Netgalley for an honest review."}

Reread all the smart witty dialogues?

It's just that good. \n I pretty much say to everyone else, you haven't lived the biggest romance faerie adventure of your life if you haven't read this magnificent masterpiece."}
{"text": "This whole series is amazing. Honestly, it was so different and very interesting to read Ward's words because they're not like the normal vampire books. The book opens up with some of the brotherhood in a club, and we're basically just seeing their P.O.V and mind set. Pretty much that's when I realized this wasn't going to be a fluffy twilight type of vampire story. There has explicit scenes, swearing and gore. This is not a book for children that is for sure. Each book in the series is following the story of a different brother's P.O.V and plot. So being the first book, it follows the leader of the Black Dagger Brotherhood, Wrath. After his most trusted friend and follower dies, he grants the one wish he had, find his half-breed daughter and protect her. This is when Beth comes in. A seemingly normal 25 year old women who works a middle class job. She automatically gets called, being the friend and reporter for the police, to the crime scene where her unknown father was murdered. This is when Wrath first sees Beth, and from there it's just hectic. \n I did not realize how much sex was going to be in this novel. Lets just say Wrath is a .... hell of a dude... Anyways, Beth and Wrath have an immediate connection and slowly she becomes apart of her father's world and starts falling for the big intimidating leader. The way the vampires work in this story is that they can eat food just like normal people, but need blood to survive and stay strong, and that blood has to be from a vampire. There are a lot of character introductions in this book and it's a bit hectic trying to remember them, I will admit. But Ward's writing style was so easy to read and follow that it definitely helped with the remembering of the names. \n If you're into vampire-erotica type of novels with lots of action, fighting and character development then this is the book and series for you! I did thoroughly enjoy this book but I wouldn't say it's my favourite in the series. Just to keep that in mind, if you do read this and want to read on there are better books in the series. J.R. Ward's book, Dark Lover, was a great introduction to the Black Dagger Brotherhood series anyways, no matter which book was better. \n IF you liked this review, check out more on my blog where I review YA and other genres! \n http://keepcalmandloveboooks.blogspot.ca"}

But one day, she notices a really handsome man, and he notices her. And her whole world changes. \n I liked Kate most of the time. But her relationship with Vincent felt rushed and a bit forced. It wasn't instalove exactly, but it wasn't far from it either. \n I didn't liked her sister much. I get that she is naive and has a different way of coping with their parents death, but her decisions were almost too naive and it felt like she was a one dimensional character made just for the plot of the book. \n I loved the Paris setting, and I was exited about the Angels aspect of the story, but was a bit disappointing. The whole book felt like a different version of Twilight. But with a less annoying heroine. Even the creepy stalking is there. \n Don't know if I will continue with the series."}
{"text": "Found that a lot of characters were from the first book (which I haven't read yet) & they were introduced into this story with very little background information. \n The story references back to the first in the series for no particular reason - doesn't seem connected with the plot. \n Think I would have enjoyed it much more if I'd read them in order. As it is, I'm not tempted to read the first book now as this one was a major spoiler."}
{"text": "Thoroughly enjoyed this book years ago when I read it. Imaginative and fun."}
{"text": "The first 30% of this book is awful. I wondered if it was the character showing naivety at one point but it was poor writing. There's lots of stuff that doesn't make sense - for example, the bizarre relationship between Anna and her adopted mother which bordered on emotional blackmail and then at the end she quotes her adopted mother by saying the best way to live someone was with an open palm/let them go. Huh. The mother has kept Anna so sheltered her whole life - unless this was a recent quote it makes no sense. Had there been a scene where she'd said to Anna \"This scares the hell out of me but I know I have to let you deal with it in your own way\" it might have made more sense. \n There's so much crying in this book - this girl would cry if you picked a daisy in front of her because you'd killed it. I suppose it makes the end confrontation slightly more believable. It does gets a bit better but I'm still a bit unclear on the character development. perhaps that is explained in the rest of the series which I'd like to read but the rest of the books are blimmen expensive."}

She's so angry, which yes, her fiance did just die, but does she have anything else to her? There was one point where she gets mad at her partner for not remembering her fiance, but then thinks he might have been influenced by a memory wipe, BUT decides he's keeping things from her because he's lying to her. This all makes sense, right? \n I don't know if I'll be reading the rest of this series. The world building is shaky and I don't know if it's worth investing in."}

{"text": "The minute a book is labeled 'urban fantasy' and the main character is a woman, people automatically assume they are going to get this smart-ass, sassy heroine who can do anything and everything under the sun. Mix in a few werewolves/vampires or a handsome guy who works for the FBI/law enforcement and you have the whole book wrapped up in a nutshell - but Black Swan Rising is not like that. \n Black Swan Rising shows that urban fantasy - good urban fantasy - doesn't have to follow the cookie cutter layout that has become so popular. It has an interesting plot, mixture of everyone's favorite vampires, fairies, demons, and the like, the use of history/art and modern-day NYC, and characters that are written in a way that readers almost instantly fall in love with them. \n The first thing that attracted my attention upon reading Black Swan Rising was the characters. There was just something about Garet James - our leading lady - and her friends and family members that just clicked. I found them likeable and easy to relate to, which lead to the easy ability to connect with this book. \n Garet James is strong, but not in the sense that she would win a fist fight or be the class bully. She's strong and independent in other ways. I think this is where Black Swan Rising veers from other urban fantasy books, as it has a relatively normal, yet strong woman in the lead. The novel was able to stand on its own without having this major, super-strong, sassy woman at the wheel of the ship and it did just fine. \n Another intriguing aspect of Black Swan Rising was the setting of the novel. It takes place in NYC. There are lots of major landmarks and attractions used in various scenes throughout the novel, which really added character to the whole book. It was nice to see a novel that focused on the historical aspect, without drowning readers in boring, dull facts. \n There were a handful of times where I did feel a little like an outsider with the whole NYC setting. I have never visited there and have no ability to reference some of the locations mentioned, but I was able to breeze through those sections and not feel totally lost. \n While Black Swan Rising is an amazing novel, it is not without its faults. Some of the novel revolves around Garet discovering all these magical elemental skills. I have to admit, this part wasn't as captivating as I would have imagined. Maybe it is because some of the stuff was so technical and out there that it was hard as a reader to follow along or maybe I just couldn't seem to follow it. Either way, it wasn't - in my opinion - one of the stronger parts of the book. \n Another weakness of the book was its habit to throw multiple fantasy creatures at the reader. There are vampires, fairies, and demons. While all play a part in the plot, they do seem a little 'thrown out there'. I would have liked to see them a little more integrated into the book and not so random. \n Overall, Black Swan Rising was a surprising novel. I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected and found the artistic elements, underground fantasy world, and loveable characters captivating until the last page. This is definitely a gentler/slower urban fantasy, but do not let that prevent you from reading it."}
{"text": "WARNING: This review contains spoilers from the first book in the series. \n Lia has finally arrived at Venda, but now she's more at danger than ever. The Konomizar, the ruler of Venda, has decided that she may be of value and plans to use her as a pawn in his power games. Kaden just wants to keep her alive, but his loyalties still lay with his country. Rafe promised he's rescuing Lia, and that his best four men are coming to infiltrate in the castle and save them; he just needs to have more time. But Lia is starting to nurture her gift and wont sit tight while everyone else uses her as a tool. \n I enjoyed this book. It took me a while to remember every character and everything that happened, but once I did I could once again connect with the characters. I enjoyed watching the reality of Venda through Lia's eyes and to see her change her preconceived ideas. The other's pov where nice, except with Pauline: I would have liked to see her taking more action. I get that she is pregnant, but they are not really doing anything really. I guess is just a way for us to know that the queen and Lia's brothers are being manipulated by the chancellor. I guess we'll know more next book, but it was painful to see the princes distrusting their sister. \n I love Rafe, and i like Kaden. Both characters are sweet and in love, but one is willing to do anything for Lia and the other is just way too naive and biased to really make an impact. I'm dying to see how things progress, since Lia definitely chose Rafe, and doesn't love Kaden the same way. I want to know what Kaden vision mean, if she is meant to be with him... maybe that means that Rafe will die. \n I liked Lia in this book. She is strong and stands up for herself every time. She is impulsive at times and a bit naive and irrational, but she is smart and stands firm for what she believes. At times I didn't agree with her actions, but she didn't rub me the wrong way like other selfish main characters of other series. \n The end of the book was a bit rushed, or maybe I read it too quickly. I can't believe The Konomizar killed Aster... but I loved that she took revenge. Finally he was dead! It's a shame she won't stay, I would have loved to see Lia as a Konomizar. Now Rafe and Lia are alone and she has two arrows in her chest!!! Talk about a cliffhanger"}

{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n From the very beginning...I had a a hard time setting it down...but alas...I did have to get some sleep...and then have some fun on vaca away from my Kindle...LOL \n This book is amazing... \n I am a lover of super-natural beings...and love reading books about vampires, werewolves, etc. It was great to read a book about \"mere-folk\"...oops sorry...they don't like being called that...they are to be referred to as Syrena. \n Emma...is the main character...and a high school student that loses a close friend during a swim in the ocean...but not before tripping into her soon to be boyfriend...Galen (a Syrena) who has tracked her in hopes of helping the two facets of the Syrena...those of Triton...and the other of Poseidon. \n While Emma grieves...Galen stays close to her...not just for the hope of keeping his kind alive...but also because he feels drawn to this girl...who shows signs of being a Syrena herself... \n Things happen...and the two become closer...first for just the show of keeping Emma's mom happy...but then their love comes forth...and soooo many others things start to pop into place...and Galen becomes torn...between duty and love. \n I go could into more details...but I think those are enough...because it is the classic love story...and the author, Anna Banks has done an excellent job of putting each of the words together to make a story soooo worth reading over and over again...and makes you want to continue reading the series...which...of course I am!!! \n I highly recommend this cook to anyone that loves a love story...and wants to dive deep into the waters of the Syrena!!!"}
{"text": "Another great entry in the Psy-Changeling series!"}
{"text": "This was such a cool concept. I'v always had a burning interest in angel/demon books and just adding gargoyles made it even better! I was pretty into this book, I couldn't put it down and had finished it in one go. Poor Layla, can't be kissed because she literally has the kiss of death. It's pretty obvious the desire Zayne holds for her, which just made it 10x more frustrating at how blind Layla was. You know, I'll admit, I think I'm team Zayne, something about him just makes me love him better than Roth! I mean, don't get me wrong, Roth is hella sexy and so raw in power, it's exhilarating to read, but.... Zayne is also powerful and smart and just.. angel like? Definitely more my type -insert heart eyes-! \n I liked that Armentrout wasn't afraid to bring in mythology to the story and plot. We heavily get into some hell-related mythology which was great. While, this story was romance-based, I did like the other stuff too. Her friends, the inside Warden drama, and Layla's dilemma. Layla wasn't the typical strong, fearless and ruthless character that I usually prefer but I did like that her ultimate priority and nature was saving the people she cared about and just good-heartedly trying to help everyone and anyone. \n Some of the characters weren't my favourite like, Stacey, who was way too portrayed as the 'slut' and the 'wild' one of the friendship between her and Layla. Also, Danika. I mean, Layla doesn't act too nice to her but come on.. being a Zayne lover myself, lets not have Danika in the picture please. I found it weird how I kind of ?liked? Petr and that unnecessary drama. Obviously we find out why he's needed in the series but for spoilers sake, I won't say. Petr was a good distraction from the whole Zayne/Roth love drama. One thing I didn't really understand about the plot was that humans very well knew gargoyles existed but.. how and why? It's almost as if everyone in the world has this, 'so what?' kind of attitude towards it, which I don't get considering usually people would be making it national news and freaking the hell out. \n The book was enjoyable but only for a light reading. If you were wanting to read this for an in-depth plot masterpiece, unfortunately you won't find it here. It was still good, and I did read the next one :) \n IF you enjoyed this review, check out more YA and other genre books on my blog! \n http://keepcalmandloveboooks.blogspot.ca"}
{"text": "3.5 STARS I adored how this story was woven from the past to the future. What a brilliant way to connect history with lore! This story has depth and an intimate look into the mind of a vampire who fights his very, violent nature. There were moments where I stopped and said, \"Yeah. I bet that is exactly how this would feel.\" Things that I had often wondered how to put into words were done so here and so elegantly written, as well. And to see such a vile creature be redeemed? I am in awe of how accepting I was to this change."}
{"text": "This is a good YA series in my opinion. It has its faults, but I really enjoyed it (specially the other books in the saga) and I liked the characters. They can be annoying at sometimes, and there where definitively times when I tough about burning the book, but after reading the first 3 books (in which you have some sort of story closure, even if they re-pick it later) I was left with a nice feeling about the saga. Definitively worth a try. If you find its not for you, that's ok too."}
{"text": "Interesting. It felt like a very slow, thoughtful book, but a lot of things went by much too quickly -- Anton and Svetlana's courtship appears to have occurred entirely between sections one and two, for example, and really nobody except for Anton and Egor got much in the way of characterization. It was neat to have the mix of fantasy elements and complicated mysteries, though, and the mysteries all had great flourishing reveals as Anton figured them out (although I would have liked to have their emotional significances worked out for a little longer). There was a slightly old-fashioned feeling from having a vaguely Holmesian hero who won by being actually smart, not just clever and tough. Also, I was fascinated to read a story so grounded in Moscow and Russia, a setting very foreign to me. \n I'm not hopping to read the sequels, though; the main point of the book seems to have been \"how do you act truly good when the consequences of anything you do seem to be evil?\", and there's only so far you can go with an answer like \"um, I don't know\"."}
{"text": "I listened to this one in audio. \n At first, I wasn't sure the audio would work. The timeline jumps, and there are a great number of characters. I often need to see ten names in order to remember them. \n But...it all worked out. \n And I really liked it. \n There was mystery, things I didn't see coming. \n There was beauty, not only in the setting-which was an obvious aspect-but in the relationships of the characters and in the writing itself. Talk about some beautiful images. \n There were characters I cared about. \n And, apparently, I'm a fan of authors who aren't afraid to do the things that I don't really want them to do-like having someone die. I don't like it, but I appreciate that the author respects me enough to not protect me from the yucky things in the world. \n A wonderful, fantastic read."}

{"text": "I'll admit that I have not read Afanasyev's collection in its entirety, but more than enough to get the gist of the work. It's a collection. Some stories will be good. Other's will be bad. Some of my favorites were ones that echoed traditional western fairy tales like Cinderella and Snow White as well as ones that were distinctly Russian. It's not something I would ever read for enjoyment. Most of these stories feel quick, bland, and unmemorable. It is a great document as a representation of Russian culture. But besides academic interests, it's not really worth the time to go through the entire thing. I believe there to be far more interesting and memorable collections out there."}

Never thought I would like all of them but by the end of the book, I feel like I am losing something again. \n To Rick Riordan, you can do anything with the next installments of the Heroes novels. Just don't kill Annabeth and Percy and don't make them break up either. \n And may I have the patience to wait for House of Hades."}

{"text": "This review was written for Joyfully Jay Reviews and can be found here: http://joyfullyjay.com/2016/06/review... \n 5+ stars... \n First off, I want to say that readers will likely want to begin this book on a weekend, or when they have some serious time to read. Because it is long. And, while I never felt it slow, there is no getting around the length. \n Secondly: wow. Or, Wow. Quite possibly WOW. \n I've read a metric ton of shifter books. Hetero, gay, lesbian, menage, YA. For real, this is a genre that I know. \n Wolfsong stands apart. \n Ox is a strapping boy, if a bit slow. He's teased for his lack of intellect, but he's a steadfast and loving boy who takes care of his mom, working in the place of his derelict father from the age of 14. He becomes a mechanic in their small town of Green Creek, building lasting friendships with his fellow grease monkeys, especially Gordo, the owner of the garage. \n Ox and his mom share a small cottage in the woods, which shares a lane with a stately home that's been abandoned nearly Ox's whole life. \n On his 16th birthday, Ox meets Joe Bennett, who he believes to be a precocious kid, but 10-year-old Joe hadn't spoken in over a year before they meet. The Bennetts have moved into the abandoned house and he wants Ox to meet his family, so he drags Ox to their house. It all seems very sweet, especially when Joe gifts Ox with a small stone wolf on the next day--a belated birthday gift. \n The Bennetts are absolutely gone for Ox, in a way that's strange to him. He has close relationships with his mom and Gordo, but Joe's parents and uncle and elder brothers really interact with him strongly. When bullies at school attempt to taunt Ox, the Bennett boys stand up for him. They invite Ox over for dinners all the time, and Joe is soon Ox's best friend. Joe's father counsels Ox continually until Ox begins to think of him as his true father--and the feeling is mutual. \n The years pass and over time Ox recognizes the oddities of the Bennett pack. Because they are indeed werewolves. His strong connection to Joe binds Ox to the pack in a way none had really predicted, and it's Ox that Joe needs to maintain his grasp on humanity. Little did Ox realize that Joe's gift so many years ago would bind them forever. Ox is a man who gives his whole heart, like Joe, even if Ox doesn't see Joe as a partner for much of the book. He is so much younger, and fragile in many ways when they meet. The story unfolds over a period of nearly fifteen years of Ox's life. And the revelations that he finds in himself and his pack are far more than Ox could have ever expected. \n Even without a love spark, Ox has a protectiveness for Joe that is unwavering. He learns of Joe's previous kidnap and torture by a rogue wolf, and is filled with rage for Joe's suffering. That his abuser lives is a serious problem, especially when he escapes his magic-fortified prison. Ox and Joe share a love that was so present for so long that the second Ox realizes the sexual feelings he has for an almost-grown Joe, he's humiliated for being so blind. There are moments of such sweetness and humor, and they help with the parts that are so dire. \n I honestly don't want to linger too long on the plot, because it is epically winding. An underdog becomes a hero. The unlovable finds love. Strength is a measure of power, and force, but also of patience and love. Bad guys will take and take until they cannot take any longer. It is the righteous who will win the day. Any of these could summarize themes in the book. Rest assured that all the threads are part of a rich and beautiful tapestry that is resolved at the end. It's mostly a love story between Ox and Joe, but also between Ox and Ox, and that may sound stupid, but Ox has no love for himself. That the future Alpha of all the North American werewolf packs, Joe, loves him is unimaginable, unfathomable. He's a simple man, and his world is turned inside out by his connection to Joe and the Bennett pack. There is first love and heartbreak and battles to the death and mourning and separation and deep longing and resentment and daring moments and heroic measures. \n The writing itself is non-standard, with prose that is lyrical in many ways and was a little challenging at first. The entire book is told by Ox's viewpoint and the spare sentence structure often belies the deep context. Repetition of certain images and memories are a big part of the story, and how Ox sees his world--not just in abstract emotions, but in vibrant color and brutal clarity. The characterization is epic, and that includes the accessory characters, as well. I could completely see several spin-off books from this one alone, because I would read whatever the author had to offer on at least five other characters from the Bennett pack. I want to assure readers that, despite the pack wars and the double crosses and the separation and the resentment, the book ends on a happy note. There are a couple of scenes of steamy goodness, but it's a small slice of the giant pie."}
{"text": "4.5stars \n Pure, the second book in The Covenant series was GREAT! The tensions between Alex and the Counsel, her and the pure bloods and most importantly, between her, Aiden and Seth grew. \n This book was entertaining because of all the surprises, secrets, and hidden agendas from many characters. Alex has to undergo quite the challenges in this book - physically as well as emotionally - while trying to figure out her feelings, what the dead Oracle told her, her intuition and the path she's destined to take. \n Overall a great book that kept me clued to my Kindle. Right now I don't know if I'm team Seth or Aiden. I love them both :) \n Also, as of right now it's not a real love triangle - let's see. \n **Note: I'm reading this series for my own enjoyment and therefore my reviews will be shorter and after I finished the whole series, I'll post a quick summary on my blog. \n ___________________________________ \n Read all my reviews (A-Z) on the blog \n Like the blog on Facebook \n Email subscription to my blog"}

{"text": "This book... I've waited sooo long of it and now that I've finished it I'm sad. It was everything I wished it to be... it was everything I was looking for... it was just perfect! The Lux series is one of my favorite paranormal YA series ever, and I don't mind that there are less steamy scenes in it than in the books I use to read because Jennifer's books have it all. Seriously, I have nothing, absolutely nothing to complain about. The story starts where the other story left off -Kat being captured, locked in in Mount Weather, holding captive by Daedalus. The book is filled with lots of action and suspense!! I try to keep this review spoiler free for the people who haven't read the first three books. \n Daemon *sigh*... he's even more perfect in Origin. He's still this cocky handsome lil bastard that puts a smile on your face. He made me laugh, swoon, and love him even more. His determination so save Kat put me in awe and I effing loved reading it. He's strong and when he put his mind into something there was no way of turning back. In Origin we can experience a softer side of him as well. He's expressing his feeling for Kat and it's heart melting adorable to read his inner dialogues -goner potential ;) \n \"I'll burn the world down to save her.\" \n \"You're my - you're my everything, Kat.\" \n \"My thoughts spun further back, to the first time I'd seen Kat walking out her front door, heading over to my house to ask direction. Even if I hadn't wanted to admit it in that moment, she had sunk her claws into me, and I didn't want them out.\" \n Kat... poor Kat had to endure so much pain while being held captive. Geez, those people at Deadalus were cruel, sadistic, and pure evil. I got sick from the things they made Kat do and as well as Daemon. But I was in awe of her; she was strong and tried to stay strong. She did hold on to her sweet memories of Daemon, their time together, hoping and praying if she'll ever see him again. And deep down I knew Daemon will come and get her that both will find a way out and THANK GOD I was right!! \n \"My memories after the doors had sealed shut were hazy. Daemon's parting words haunted every moment. I love you Kat. Always have. Always will.\" \n Those two are such an adorable and funny couple it was pure bliss to read about them in Origin. Their dialogues cracked me up sometimes cause even though everyone, and I mean everyone wants to harm they, Daemon can't shut up and throws out the funniest stuff ... \n \"Shut up.\" She brushed her lips against mine. I nipped at her lower lip, and a rosy flush appeared on her cheeks. \"Hmm, you know how I like it when you get all mouthy with me.\" \"You're mental\" \n .... LOL!! \n The book introduced a new character, Archer, and I really liked him. He is an interesting and very complex character, which leads back to the title of the book -but nope, I won't spoil anything, just read for yourself. In the beginning I wasn't quite sure what he's up against but THEN when I knew his plan, I was all team Archer. You'll like him. \n Origin is written in dual POV, and the ppl that know me, know how much I love that. Being in Daemon's head was great; it made me fall for him even more. This book has so many surprises in it -positive as negative- that I was bummed to know the last Lux book will be released next summer *sucks*. And yes, the book ends with an effing cliffhanger and my first thought was: WTH!! I wanted to read more, so much more cause I loved this book so much. So yes, I'll be sitting impatiently, stalking Jennifer's authors page, until the last book is being released. \n \"I want to spend every second, every minute, every hour with you.\" Part of me couldn't believe something so cheesy had come out of my mouth, but it was also very beautifully true. \"I want a year's worth of seconds and minutes with you. I want a decade's worth of hours, so many that I can't add them up.\" \n When you get to those pages when Daemon pours his heart out, you'll be goner like me for sure!! \n If you have loved the first 3 books in the Lux series, you WON'T be disappointed at all with Origin. Jennifer delivered another great book <3"}
{"text": "Re-read. Old rating 4 stars. New rating 2 stars. \n I've been in a major romance slump lately. So it only made sense to me that I should re-read the books that I've already rated highly but read so many years ago that I don't actually remember them all that well. Because a good book is a good book, right? \n So, the plot. Somewhere very far away, a thousand years ago, super-amazing-gorgeous-warrior-amazing-lover aka Tristan was sleeping with an absolutely horrible woman named Zirra. He's well aware of how awful she is so I don't really understand that. Anyway, he makes it clear that it will always just be sex and she refuses to believe that. When he finally makes it really really really clear, she freaks out and curses him to be a slave to her pleasure and stuffs him in a tiny jewelry box a la genie. He has to be a slave to the pleasure of any woman that possesses his box and the curse will only be lifted when he finds true love. After that, he'll be transported back to his home from wherever he happens to be. Due to some shady politics going on, the box is taken from Zirra and sent far away to protect that tenuous peace on his home planet. A thousand or so years later, the box ends up in a flea market where Julia, our heroine is shopping for her antique shop. She is drawn to the box and buys it. While cleaning it, she pops it open and Tristan appears. He explains that he is there for her pleasure and she makes it clear that she wants nothing from him. Tristan is taken aback by this and the two of them begin to fall for one another. Zirra, of course, is still alive in Imperia and still wants her sex slave, so she does her best to find Tristan. \n So much of this book rubbed me the wrong way. Tristan endured neglect to the point of abuse as a child and then was forced into sexual slavery for centuries. He had to do everything his *shudder* \"masters\" commanded him. However distasteful, however degrading, he had no choice. How did my younger self somehow gloss over this really disturbing fact? When he finally understands that Julia really isn't going to use him for sex he thinks she so incredibly kind and then, of course, decides he wants to sleep with her for the fun of it. And as for Julia, she had a disastrous date when she was 16 that ruined her self-esteem and doomed her to a life of virginal awkwardness. She hasn't dated since that one horrible date. Tristan just can't believe Julia isn't going to command him to clean her toilets or murder a non-existent husband and Julia is just so excited that a man could actually find her size 8 body appealing. So of course it's true love. REALLY? YOU PEOPLE NEED TO GET OUT MORE. \n As others have mentioned, the fact that Zirra was eventually cursed the same way she cursed Tristan did not feel like revenge. It was just disturbing. So now she has to spend an eternity as a sex slave. Was she unhinged and homicidal? Yes. But sentencing her to an eternity of non-consensual sex just doesn't sit right with me. Tristan endured it for a thousand years. What if Zirra endures it for 4 thousand? 10 thousand? I mean, anyone in a box is immortal. This didn't really feel like the right time for the whole \"eye for an eye\" thing. I didn't feel it was justice, it was just rapey and wrong. Death would have been better. \n I found the idea of Tristan and Julia's relationship while Tristan was hers to command so...weird. He was still physically bound to do anything she said. If the roles were reversed people would be chucking this book out the window. It really ruined so much of the romance. It was like a constant cloud of weirdness that floated above everything that was supposed to be sexy or swoon-worthy. \n Honestly, the only reason I'm giving any stars is the fact that everything that wasn't part of the romance was pretty damn funny. I actually laughed out loud when Tristan kept murdering phones in an attempt to protect Julia. Despite any complaints I have about Gena Showalter's books, they always manage to make me smile and occasionally laugh like a mad woman. However, I will most definitely not be reading this again."}
{"text": "Pretty good story. Great world building of which I would like to see more."}
{"text": "Abaddon's a mid-level devil who's required to collect a certain quota of souls, but not all souls are equal. Like, corrupting one pure soul is worth more than a dozen athletes dying to Go Pro...for example. Abaddon really dislikes soul harvesting. He avoids it, at all cost, but he's gotten a warning due to his lack of productivity and is due to be demoted if he doesn't get one soul in the next month. \n So, Abaddon searches high-and-low for a sterling soul, one that will push his quota far back. He locates one such soul, a shining beacon of a man, in Seth. Seth is the blind virtuoso who plays for a tent revival group which travels the southeastern US. He's also more than just a man--as Abaddon soon learns. \n Seth is 21, innocent, sweet and complete catnip for Abaddon. His soul-hunger is off the charts whenever he's near Seth. Seth was an orphan, dropped at the doorstep of the revival, and adopted by the late revival master. He gets along with his surrogate family, and truly believes in the word of The Lord, but he wants a true love, and he's both a virgin and gay. It's interesting and cool that the revivalists are totally unaffected by that. The more time Abaddon spends in Seth's presence, the more he begins to realize that Seth is mystical in a way that's nearly unheard of. I don't want to give too much away, but expect trials with snakes and faith healing that works. \n In the meantime, Abaddon is plotting his harvest of Seth's soul, and he's also really wrecked over it. How can he condemn such a good man to an eternity in Hell? There are surely things Abaddon can trade Seth to make his human life more bearable, but will Seth accept them, knowing these gifts come from a Devil's hand? As atonement, Abaddon plans to pull every string he can to ensure that he and Seth will be able to connect in Hell, and spend their eternity together. It's still cold comfort for Abaddon... \n It's a quick read and an interesting story. I do love me a conflicted devil, and Abaddon is really a fun character to enjoy. The scenes in Hell are amusing and made me chuckle many a time. The unfolding romance was tender and touching, and I swooned for Seth just as hard as Abaddon did. I hadn't quite predicted the full path of this book, which charmed me, as a reader. I loved the positive portrayal of the revivalists, and the stalwart and battle-ready chaperone that Seth and Abaddon had to avoid whenever they wanted some alone-time. There's a heady build up of sexual tension, and a sweet love that's on the page."}

{"text": "It's more like a 3.5. \n While I really liked the 1st two books, this one seemed rushed, especially towards the ending. So many questions were left unanswered like: \n 1. How on the bloody Earth can you simulate pupils with contacts? I mean, I'm no expert, but contacts are fixed, they don't move around like pupils do, do they? \n 2. Physically speaking, wights should be blind. No pupils= no eyesight. \n 3. If they age forward when they go forward in time because time catches up with them, what happens when they go way back in time? \n 4. A loop needs a ymbryne to rewind it, no? That's what they said in the 1st book. Then Devil's Acre also needed an ymbryne. Doesn't matter if it's a secret loop or punishment loop. \n 5. Was Fiona really dead? Did they even go and put her body to rest? \n 6. Did they find Sergei's wife and child? Is he really dead? What did he mean by the see you on the other side line? \n 7. What happened to the 2 hollows- Jacob's Rogue Hollow and the one under the bridge? What happened to the sleeping hollow Jacob drugged with Mother Dust's powder? \n 8. What happened to Caul- I mean they said he'd come back as a hollow, no? \n 9. Where is Nim? \n 10. Are Melina and the Brothers ok? Did the ymbrynes manage to find a way to help the children whose souls the wights partially extracted? Did they find a way to help the ones whose entire souls were extracted? \n 11. What were the voices, noises, feelings of being watched and creepiness to the Library of Souls? Was it only background noise to add the atmosphere of the book with no explanation? \n 12. Is Sam dead? Did she somehow die in the war? I am curious what happened to her. \n Also, the ending is unrealistic. Some books are just better without the sugar coated, unrealistic happy ending. I mean, they somehow realized their ages were reset? What? And then they go and live in Jacob's house completely out in the open, forcing themselves on Jacob's parents and manipulating and controlling them? the And they all live happily ever after? Fudge"}

At first, I wasn't sure if I wanted to put the sticker anywhere; the cover art is delightful and balanced, and I felt the sticker might spoil it. \n Then I finished the book, and I applied the sticker. \n I'd heard the first two thirds of the book before, read by Rothfuss, and I had an idea of what to expect. The ending doesn't disappoint, but it's probably not the thing to leave out when your young nieces and nephews are likely to visit. The art, as I have said, is fantastic and will absolutely suck in young readers (especially as many of today's children's books are generally so bland). Adults will enjoy them even more. The story is fun and generally paces well. \n Overall, recommended if you're the sort of person who likes this sort of thing. It's not for everyone, so don't say you weren't warned. But it certainly is for a lot of people with a particular type of humor."}
{"text": "Release date: June 17, 2107 \n 5 very enthusiastic stars \n Okay, I'm big enough to admit it. I seriously overestimated my memory and underestimated how very detailed Nalini Singh's books are. I saw that this was a new series and I remembered reading one or a couple of her books years ago and I jumped at the opportunity to read this. I've been reading too many HR novels and wanted something different. All it took was Nalini Singh's name on the cover and the mention of bear changelings and I was all in. \n I was pretty lost when I started it. There was so much information that I just didn't understand and ended up smiling and nodding through. Things are explained to the extent that I could follow what was happening, but I had no emotional attachment to 75% of the characters beyond knowing who was good and who was bad. Fortunately for me, the other 25% were fantastic enough that it didn't even matter that I was meeting them for the first time. \n I'm going to put the synopsis as a spoiler as not to ruin anything. I don't know what was previous knowledge or new to previous readers. \n The book opens with Valentin Nikolaev, the alpha of the Stonewater bear clan knocking on Silver Mercant's door. Apparently, he's been doing his best to woo/court her for the last 10 months. He is smitten with Silver, who is Psy and head of EmNet. EmNet is the fact of a new alliance between the Psy, Changelings, and humans. Despite the fact that Silver is Silent, something about Valentin fascinates and calls to her. Valentin happens to be at Silver's apartment when there is an attempt on her life and ends up saving her life. He convinces Silver's grandmother that Silver would safest in a place no one would ever think to look for her, Stonewater. Valentin takes advantage of Silver's presence in his home to do his best to break through Silver's decision to be Silent and win her over. He knows in his heart that Silver is his mate. However, Valentin's success is bittersweet. Silver falls for him but also shares with him that Silence is what is keeping her from going insane. It is a race against time to somehow find a way for Silver to embrace her emotions and love of Valentin and keep herself from going mad. In the midst of all this, Valentin, Silver, and those that they both trust work to find out who wants Silver dead and what their end game is. \n Even before reading it, I knew this book would amazing. It did not disappoint. Valentin is without a doubt my favorite book bf of the year. Well, at least for a new series. I'm not really the biggest fan of shifter/changeling books but Singh's books are an exception. I loved every minute of Silver Silence. Silver was strong, powerful, confident, and incredibly likable. Valentin was just delightful. So damn perfect. He not only loved that Silver was incredibly strong and competent, it was a huge part of why he loved her. He would do anything for her, even if it hurt him. He was just one giant bundle of sigh-worthy bear. \n I don't really feel comfortable passing judgment on the plot seeing as I didn't understand the story behind a lot of it. What I can say is that I found it interesting and fast paced. The writing was superb. I loved the science behind so much of it and the detail and care Singh takes with each of the different races (factions? I'm not sure exactly what to call them.) There was an enormous amount of information about the humans, Psy, and changelings without drowning the reader in it. I never felt overwhelmed by all of the information despite the fact that it was all new to me. I can absolutely see why this series is loved by so many. I'm already looking forward to the next book in this series. \n I just loved this book. Absolutely recommend. \n *I received an ARC in exchange for a fair and honest review."}

Which flaps are good to read but really don't spoil the vast majority of the book. \n I found the characters, stiff, stilted, boring and just plain dull. The internal dialog as Shadow didn't do anything for me, it didn't make me like her or intensely dislike her. I can honestly say I felt NOTHING for the characters. \n The action jumped around. There were times where I'd read something and wonder where it was going and then we were taken another direction. Meanwhile I'm sitting there going \"But what about.....\".

(I'm sure I would if I had the chance. Wouldn't you?) This launches a series of improbable adventures that takes her across all of England with only 10 pounds in her pocket. I've read a lot of these mind-trippy books with supposed explanations of the reality behind this illusion we call life, but I've got to say this is the only one with a theory so sound that I'm actually tempted to believe it. Thomas is really a wonderful writer, equally adept at expounding huge theories like this and narrating small moments where people are having unimportant conversations over tea. My only teeny reservation is that the love story seems a little bit too pat to be believable, but I guess love at first sight sometimes happens, right?"}

{"text": "This was a quick, fast, dystopian YA novel that sets you up for more books. There is a blood fever that came through the land and killed all of the adults who contracted it, but to each of the kids that contracted it, it left them with markings and special abilities. Society has attached these people with a stigma that is only getting worse, very similar to what the Jews experienced in Germany before the war. They are being blamed for all the poverty or struggle, they are being limited in social interactions, they are being threatened to be banned from the city, etc. Our main character is a girl with one eye who had the blood fever as a child. Nobody knows her skill though since she has been unable to produce it while running away to prevent being illegally bought underage to be some gross guy's mistress (and who wouldn't run away from that lovely scenario). Now that she's produced these special powers, the government wants to get rid of her but she's saved by a band of other people with special abilities and becomes a part of this group trying to bring the government down and put the rightful prince on the thrown. That's the basic premise of the novel in a nutshell. It didn't wow me but it did take me on an adventure that I want to see where it leads, so there's that. It is definitely in the same vein as An Ember in the Ashes, so if you enjoyed that book, you'll probably enjoy this one as well."}
{"text": "Note: I received a free copy in exchange for an honest review and as part of a blog tour with Xpresso Book Tours. \n Check out the giveaways as part of the tour here: \n http://nadanessinmotion.blogspot.com/... \n The Enchanted Rose by Nadia Nader, is a novella or short novel and the first in a new and gripping series. \n The protagonist is Vivian, whose mother recently passed away and who has been shipped off to quirky aunts she's never heard of in a town called Misty Hills. There she begins to learn about her lineage, her family and their curse. Worst of all, Vivian discovers she has a twin sister and a hoard of secrets kept hidden by her mother. \n When Vivian asks one of her aunts (Agnes) why her mother had never mentioned them, she says: \"Your mother never mentioned us because she was desperate to break free. Mentioning us would have made her escape futile... As it is, you are back with us, so she never managed to truly escape.\" \n Upon her first encounter with her twin sister Rose, Vivian is told \"You shouldn't have let her come back. Her father didn't want her. And neither do we,\" which set the loathing, jealousy and anger between the two sister from the beginning of the novel. There are other previous examples, but I felt this was one of the strongest. \n Later when Rose says \"I've been okay for the past fifteen years without you, I don't need you now,\" we understand that Rose has been hating and holding a grudge against her sister for fifteen years. \"Her eyes shone with unconcealed hatred. Her voice dripped with deadly venom.\" \n I like how Ms. Nader includes comic relief in her novel. Vivian is sometimes sarcastic but the clash between her and her sister Rose often leads to humourous situations, or black comedy. \n \"I was horrified that she would describe Rose as \"cheerful,\" and it must have showed, Mrs. Sherwood laughed.\" \n Bit by bit, we learn about the history of Misty Hills and the curse that haunts each family. What I liked about the story of how the curse came to be, is that the original story of two sisters contrasts with the bad relationship between Vivian and Rose. \n Vivian is doubtful of everything when she arrives in Misty Hills and remains so till the end of the novel; I like how that part in her character didn't change, making the reader that all that is going on is a dream. I also liked Vivian's character development as well as Rose's. \n I didn't feel that the book title \"The Enchanted Rose\" was the appropriate one as we don't see that reflected in the novel. It might be a good name for the whole series but not the first instalment. It also misleads the reader into thinking it will be a bit of a Beauty and the Beast story. \n The novel is filled with vivid but enjoyable description and imagery. \n \"There was a wild and wonderful beauty to the unkempt grounds.\" \n It also has the mysterious Hunter, who does not appear often but has a huge secret (and I expect a major role in the coming book(s)). \n I like how the novel does not focus on romance; there is Hunter but there isn't anything \"romantic\", which for me makes the novel stronger at least for this part. \n Overall, I enjoyed the novel and I believe I finished it in a couple of days. It would have been one day, if I didn't have \"stuff\"."}

A quick, fun and light read, and I absolutely loved Marvin; the Paranoid depressed Android. Written in 1979 and a true modern scifi classic nowadays, it has made its mark; and now I finally found the answer to the question of life, the universe and everything, a reference that already passed me by millions of times. \n \"This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time.

{"text": "When we start off Book 3 of the Gryphon series, we find Celeste is happily in love with Caleb, the half-demon who helped save her and her family form the demon Countess in Book 2. Caleb's been infected with Titan blood to help his demonic transformation, and that becomes a problem when The countess now send every Titan into battle with humanity. \n See, if the titan whose blood was used to create Caleb is killed, he will die. The only way to save Caleb is to remove his demonic nature and erase all trace of his memory--yet Celeste holds on. She loves Caleb terribly and wants to keep him at her side. When the Titans arrive and hurt her brother, Gabe (who morphs into a protector lion to fight) Celeste knows she must sacrifice her love for Gabe in order to keep him and her family from harm. This is even harder to do when Caleb proposes marriage...but Celeste is stalwart--she makes the right choice even though it means losing Caleb forever. \n In dealing with that pain, Celeste seeks out Rowan, another half-demon, and a tentative friend, who can alter her mood by skin-on-skin contact. She takes to spending lots and lots of time with Rowan, all platonic as she's desperately heart-broken, and never realizes that his feelings are, perhaps, more than friendly. To me, I think she knew--she simply didn't want to \"go there\". \n In the meantime, her brother Gabe is planning to marry Alaina--their former spirit guide. And of course everything gets messed up. They nearly call the wedding off when the dress shop is trashed and the wedding hall explodes due to the Countess's unrelenting war on Celeste. The Countess wants to kill Celeste in order to call forth the Gryphon--her archenemy--into battle. And, because the Countess is a demon, she's cool with killing all Celeste's family and firends first. You know, to add to the suffering. \n Rowan comes to the rescue--for the wedding anyway. And the mixing of the human and otherworldly guests leads to some fun times. Oh, and suddenly there's something demonic about Celeste's sister Kendall. Which leads to the first close-to-Celeste fatality. We get a three pronged standoff between Celeste's warriors, the Countess's army and a newly sprung demonic horde under the control of Barnabus/Alec from Book 1 which is at the boil over stage. \n Ever the pirate, Rowan is hurt by Celeste's rebuffs. And this leads to the climactic scene wherein Celeste nearly bites it. Again. I swear this gal is constantly in peril. One of the perks of being a conduit. But, she has some new friends to help and the day is saved. \n This third book in the series is really a great showcase. So many intertwining plot lines have developed. It's kinda sad about Rowan. I never suspected Celeste would really fall for him, but it's still sad to see the effort he makes to meet her more than halfway--and then be refused. This book is light on the romance, as a result, which is fine because the battles have really lit up the pages, and we don't have too much time for pining over Caleb. It's an innocent read, suitable for YA readers of all flavors. The urban fantasy/paranormal elements are great, but this book really needs to be read after book 2, in my opinion. Too much history to catch up with to jump in here..."}

{"text": "7th&up \n I love to read, but if someone asks me what my favorite genre is, historical fiction really doesn't make the list. As it happens, the last three books that I've read were YA historical fantasy, and each one blew me away. \n I opened this book with hesitation, almost certain that the setting (California Gold Rush) would be dull and a chore to get through. \n Up next on the menu: a full plate of crow. I tore through the pages of this lush, engaging, realistic but suspenseful story. Carson painted such a vivid picture that whenever I glanced away from the book I was shocked that I wasn't surrounded by a harsh, unwelcoming land, with the sun blazing down, no water in sight, in the company of people that I wasn't sure that I could trust with my secrets, or my life. I became Lee, and took her troubles on as my own. I feared the villain in the story, yearned to go back in time when I had the comfort of my parents near me, mourned their loss, and worried that my only friend in the world was lost to me.

{"text": "This is an upper YA/New Adult type of read which features two 18 yo boys who finally experience a real love. \n Olly and Scott were best mates from the ages of 9-14. Then there was a kiss. And, their friendship dissolved. Olly admitted he was gay, and Scott would never admit to such a thing, not with his extremely homophobic father pressuring him to keep away for Olly. \n Now, they are 18, and finishing their A-levels (think: senior year in high school here in the US). The pressure is on, and their coming exams will determine which uni they'll attend. When Scott takes a bad turn and injures Olly by mistake, their animosity is exposed out on the street. Miss Wychwood, odd neighbor to Olly, takes a particular interest in the melee, and it's not long before Olly and Scott have their lives turned upside down. Olly wakes inside of Scott, and Scott is trapped in Olly's body. \n It's a body swap! I've loved this trope since the original Parent Trap (with Hayley Mills!!) and I really enjoyed how it worked here. Instead of Olly and Scott helping others connect, they get a unique chance to discover all the good and bad bits of the other, and come to terms with their true feelings. While \"Olly\" is brushing up his footie skills so as to not shame Scott on the school pitch, \"Scott\" is learning all the lines for Romeo, as he's now the lead in the school play. If it means \"Olly\" gets the chance to flirt with boys--and even kiss them (as Scott has secretly desired for a while), well then \"Scott\" must also snog \"his\" girlfriend. Poor Olly! He sure knew he didn't have a single scrap of heterosexuality after those experiences in Scott's stead. Thing is, Scott becomes more and more convinced that he's the one living the lie--and that Olly is the love of his life. Olly already knew that about Scott; it's why he broke off their friendship four years ago--he couldn't bear to watch Scott date girls. \n This book is a *little* light on the sexytimes, compared to other books by this author, but it fit reasonably well with the story. These are boys trapped in the others' body--and it feels like an invasion of privacy to indulge even in manual stimulation. They do break down those barriers, as they build a better rapport and reconnect with each other. I liked how their bond had some time to develop, and it's SOOO tender. And sweet. And just a bit hot, too. \n I really liked how Scott's parents dealt with the changes they are noticing in \"Scott.\" Olly, in Scott's stead, is exposed to Scott's dad's homophobia, and that's pretty rough. Olly's own parents are super open and loving, and it was interesting to see the careful steps that Scott's mother took to open communication and build a better rapport. Scott's girlfriend, on the other hand, wasn't a nice gal, and Scott was better off being fully shot of her. I liked his friends, on the whole, and I LOVED how conscientious Olly was--to be mindful of Scott's needs and not trying to make any permanent changes that would play out unfavorably when/if he and Scott swapped back to their original selves. \n Ultimately, this is a sweet read, with lots of excellent introspection, a little magic and a YA-ish level of sexual exploration. It's probably a bit racy for young teens, but the emotional accessibility will appeal to all age levels."}

(took me a while to find the right word haha) personas or even their original nature that they started with in the first book. This only correlates with Valek, Yelena, Irys, Ambrose etc. The only two characters that didn't really change were Janco and Ari, which I was happy about :) Thats pretty much all I have to say about this series! \n Thank you Snyder for the perfect first book, Poison Study."}

{"text": "A fun bit of fluff. Though the male protagonist of this story is a vampire, don't come into this expecting a dark and scary read. The tone of this book is light and sweet. Though Ian is almost killed by Ben the vampire hunter and Angelica is kidnapped by a vampire named Rosetta acting to protect John Polidori, author of \"The Vampyre\" these potentially grave problems are completely resolved with ridiculous quickness and don't alter the breezy tone Ann affects throughout. \n This book doesn't have a lot of depth to it in terms of plot, world building or characterization but if you go in ready for a light entertainment it's got charm. The premise is solid, Ian and Angelica are cool characters who have a fun relationship to read about, Ann writes good dialogue. I really enjoyed Angelica's attempts to repel Ian and how miserably they failed because he *gasp* actually wanted a bookish proto-feminist."}

Throughout this tale of new adventures, dangers and experiences, Chupeco also gives the reader plenty of warning of dark times to come- a jaded slightly older Tea also plays a part, and she is bent on bringing chaos and revenge to her enemies. \n While this novel drags at times as Chupeco builds a solid foundation for her world, and Tea was not always an enjoyable character, this is a book I would recommend to my teen patrons, and for my own part, I plan on keeping an eye out for the sequel. \n Thank you to Sourcebooks Fire and NetGalley for providing this ARC in exchange for an honest review."}

{"text": "Freeks by Amanda Hocking \n I think awkward flirting and adorable family bonds must be a sweet spot in books right now, but that's GREAT because I've found lots of those books that have recently that focus on tight family relationships. For me, paranormal romance and fantasy romance works the best when there are other strong relationships in the story that balance out the romance, making the entire story feel more authentic. Enter Freeks, which is something of the love child between The Night Circus (a book I was surprisingly 'meh' about) and Grey/Dark Shadows/Beautiful Creatures (ah yes, I do really have a paranormal sweet spot that I need to be scratched every once and while, hmm?) \n Enter Mara, a traveling carnie/circus worker in a freak show with people with actual paranormal powers. (A note: this book is set several decades in the past, which negates cell phones and the ease of newer communication, which would've riddled this story's plot with holes, especially the opening when Blossom disappears. It's amazing what 'go call her on the cell' can do to a story.) Mara has no powers (or at least she thinks she doesn't) for most of this book. She is, of course, wrong. Her mom is a necromancer and communes with the dead, and her mom's boyfriend and head of the circus, Gideon, is a psychic. When the beat-up trailers and wagons roll into Caudry for a high-paying gig, their powers start doing strange things, and everyone realizes they've stumbled into a magical mess that might require running from the town and ruining the circus. \n Freeks wastes no time in introducing townie and adorable love interest, Gabe, who meets Mara when she's walking through Caudry and admiring the old mansions. Gabe's sister, Selena, is having a birthday part, and Mara is invited in off the street. Adorable flirting ensues, but the savvy paranormal reader (if you're reading this blog, I assume you might count yourself among this number) knows there's something off about Gabe. If you can guess it (which you might be able to), you know where this story is heading. That said, I loved a lot of the scenes between Mara and Gabe because the stress at the circus, and how Mara clearly cares more for her family than a boy she just met, which helps make their relationship feel real-yet-also-adorable. \n When a monster attacks the carnival, a series of employees gets hurt. No one can figure out who sent the monster or what it's after, and the town's people are belligerent at worst and diffident and disinterested at best in the well-fare of the carnival workers. There are some obvious hints as to what the creature might be and who might be benefitting from it killing the carnival workers, and none of these things are subverted too heavily. There was one true surprise for me (Gabe really doesn't know anything! He's not actually a love lead villain!), but after ravenously reading this book, the ending fell a bit flat. It was weirdly anti-climactic and rushed after the detail that went into building the world and relationships of Freeks. Still, a 'meh' ending didn't ruin a solid paranormal story. \n Rating: 4 stars. I loved the characters, the family bonds, and the adorable flirting, but the ending let me down a bit. It was a bit too predictable and neat."}
{"text": "Mare Barrow is on the run. She used to be a Red - born with red blood with nothing special about her - until one day she accidentally revealed that she had Silver - born with silver blood and special abilities - abilities to the royal families. They took her in and tried to make her one of them, but she never wanted to be one of them. She planned a coup along with a few other Silvers - including her betrothed and the younger prince Maven - and the Scarlet Guard - an organization made up of Reds who go against the crown. She thought it was going to work out until she learned some horrifying truths. The Queen killed Cal - the older prince -mother and that her special gifts aren't as rare as she thought. There are hundreds of people like her - newbloods - and thankfully she has a list. But she forgot one very important lesson. In this time, anyone can betray anyone. \n Maven betrayed her. The Queen forced Cal to execute his own father and Maven arrested him for being a traitor along with Mare. They were to fight to the death in the arena, until they somehow escaped. Now they are on the run, but Mare has a plan. A poorly hatched plan, but a plan nonetheless. She has the list of the newbloods and she is going to save them, because Maven has that list too and he's coming for them. Only instead of killing them, she wants to protect them and maybe use them to form an army that will help take down the Silvers once and for all. \n All aboard!

{"text": "I was a little disappointed in this book. I was all excited for a fairy book that had some great action and it wasn't like I didn't get that. I thought that the world was really well thought out, but at times it seemed almost to complicated for a YA book geared for 5th graders. It was just so hard for me to keep track of names of places and the history. \n What I didn't like about this book was that at times it would talk about something and you would begin to wonder if you missed something, when in fact you didn't and it would be explained 100 pages later. It got to the point where I couldn't figure out if I missed something or if it wasn't explained yet to me. \n I did like that this book revolves around fairies. There are very few books that use those as the main characters and when they are used they are Tinkerbell like. These are fighting ones with different types and personalities. \n Over all I thought it was an intresting read and I might read the second oen that is coming out, however I thought the writing style was a little above a 5th grade and takes a certain type of reader to really understand it and like it."}
{"text": "Pevel returns to seventeenth century France in this second novel of the Cardinal's Blades. A new threat rises to threaten the future of France. La Donna, an Italian spy known for her subterfuge and intrigue and, of course, inescapable and beguiling beauty, possesses information of a plot against the King and is willing to share it, for a price. \n As a French adventure story that is supposed to remind us of Dumas - if Alexandre had had a penchant for dragons, dragonnettes, and dracs running rampant in the streets of Paris and the French countryside alongside the musketeers, that is - Pevel succeeds. \n There is a flavor to this novel that is very reminiscent of nineteenth century adventure \n novels, doused liberally with fantasy elements. This novel isn't without its difficulties, though. As a sequel, it stumbles a little. Certain revelations from the first book are largely ignored in this sequel, a flaw that only can be overlooked thanks to stronger writing on Pevel's part. The reader has to be prepared to do a little bit of work as Pevel traces a path through Paris street by street in what can be a confusing list of streets. Pevel, like Dumas (but sometimes without the same grace), suffers the crime of random information dumps, which mire this story in unnecessary complexity at times. Too much information, especially when revealed in a story utilizing the third person omniscience of the all knowing, all seeing, all explaining author, lends a detachment to the reader that makes it difficult to invest fully in the characters. \n \"The Alchemist in the Shadows\" is a good read, but you may have to \n work for it a little bit. ."}

{"text": "This was my first Guy Gavriel Kay book that I have shown any interest in. And it was quite an experience for myself. \n GG Kay's books require a bit of time and thought behind them to fully understand and appreciate them. That's not to say that they can't be read in one sitting I just believe for those that haven't learned to read his style of writing it could take a bit of time to get used to. \n Those that are looking for a plot that is straight-forward and upfront probably wouldn't enjoy this novel. While the storyline and characters are captivating, GG Kay takes readers on a round about journey to learn what is going on. There are side stories and side character interactions that take place, that divert from the storyline. \n Another aspect that was a bit dizzying to the reader is the repetition of information that was told just pages before. I understand the need to make sure certain points are portrayed but there was no need to repeat them in such a short time span. \n On the other hand there is so much detail that made this book amazing. The amount of depth into this whole Asain culture is absolutely mind blowing and really captivating. I couldn't draw myself away from it and really found it convincing. \n The plot line while it does take a bit to get into is a bit captivating. There was something that kept me wondering about what would happen with the horses and the whole assassins. It was this ability to leave a reader wanting more that kept me reading. \n Overall, it took a bit of time to get used to the writing and long descriptions but it was a great read. The characters and background stories were amazing, and the mystery involved with the main plot was captivating. There is plenty of research and background that went into it and for those that enjoy Asian flared stories this is the book for you."}

{"text": "Truthwitch was a highly hyped, almost to the point of being classified as overhyped, YA fantasy novel that was to be released right as the new year rolled in. It was being compared by promoters and individuals to the Throne of Glass series by Sarah J. Maas - who just so happens to be a good friend of the author of Truthwitch. \n Being a fan of Throne of Glass, I was curious to see how Truthwitch turned out. Does it live up to the hype or will it turn out to be another overly hyped up novel that falls flat? After completing Truthwitch, I can say that in some aspects - yes it does live up to the hype. However, there are certain areas within the book that could be worked on and improved. \n Truthwitch for fans of Throne of Glass will be an absolute amazing hit. It is adventurous, has extremely strong - and sometimes aggravating - main heroines, and the magic system (which sort of reminded me of something similar to The Last Airbender) is absolutely amazing. That doesn't mean it isn't without its flaws. \n Truthwitch started out relatively slow. There was an annoying habit of talking about places, people, and even parts of the magic system, as if we the readers should know what was going on. Upon the start of the novel, I had to look up whether this was in fact a first novel in a series because I felt confused and a bit lost. Eventually, I decided to just continue to read and see how it turned out. When I did this, I realized that things slowly start to unravel and make sense. \n Unfortunately, the confused and rather dropped in feeling readers may have at the beginning of the book might be enough to turn people away. While it is great to unravel and reveal things throughout a story, if readers are unable to connect and understand what is going on, it might cause people to stop reading. Things do work out in the end, but this was one of the problems with Truthwitch. \n Another problem with Truthwitch was the plot. Ultimately, the entire novel chronicles the adventurous journey of Safi and Iseult as they are running away. Yes, there are other elements thrown in - warring territories, evil kings/emperors, romance, and a bloodwitch - thrown in, but those elements aren't really fleshed out. If you are looking for a fleshed out three-dimensional story, Truthwitch is probably not going to be for you. \n For example, there is a long standing truce that has been struck between the many different territories. This truce prohibits people from harming and hurting each other and brought peace to the world during a time of war. That truce is now almost up and war is on the horizon. That is really all that is given. If you are wondering why the truce might not be resigned or what this big war is on the horizon, you aren't going to find out - at least not in this book maybe it'll be explored in the other novels. \n Of course because this big war is coming up or possibly coming up, it means that people are in need of a rare truthwitch - which is what Safi is and happens to be the only one in the territory. Unfortunately, because there was no real explanation for why the war was coming up or what was going on, it made it hard to understand why all the nations were fighting to get their hands on a truthwitch. It sort of makes sense at the end of the book, but even then if you try to dive deep into it there aren't really answers to some of the questions that many people might have. \n I found myself constantly asking multiple questions in an effort to understand some of the reasons why certain things or events were happening in the novel. Unfortunately, I never got answers. I don't expect all my questions to be answered in a single novel, but it was a bit frustrating to walk away with thousands more questions than answers. \n Even though there were some definite drawbacks to Truthwitch, it doesn't mean it was a horrible book. There are plenty of elements that made it a pleasant novel and will make it a top 2016 novel for some people. \n One of the strongest parts of Truthwitch was the amazing bond between the two main characters. Safi and Iseult are best friends forever, which in the Witchlands is considered Threadsisters. They would do anything for each other and each one watches the other's back. They are polar opposites to each other, but somehow they complement each other and make their characters almost lift off the page. \n I found it refreshing to see such a strong bond between two female lead characters. All too often it is easy to make females fight amongst each other, and yes our characters do squabble and argue occasionally, but it was amazing to see their relationship portrayed so well. It was their friendship that really made me continue to read the novel until the end. \n Overall, I will say that Truthwitch is a great start to what will be a promising series. It certain had a few hiccups along the way, but nothing that can't be worked out or eventually overcome as more novels are released. \n If you weren't a fan of Throne of Glass - the sappy romance, following a sometimes frustrating and naive main character, and the obvious YA tropes thrown in - then Truthwitch is certainly not the book for you. Those who loved Throne of Glass will love Truthwitch and be relieved to have another amazing series to follow. \n I personally will still follow this series. While it might not be one of my top novels for 2016 - it is still too early to tell - it had enough going for it that I would love to return to the world and characters."}

{"text": "This is the first book I have read by Heather Graham, the multiple award winning romantic suspense author. And honestly speaking, it left me cold. \n The premise is intriguing enough...a woman is murdered by her husband who is supposed to have been killed by the mafia. Even as FBI agent Brett is investigating the case more such murders by 'dead men' are revealed and the media goes ballistic about 'zombie attacks'. Meanwhile, Lara who has just started working at Sea Life, a dolphin research facility, gets a shock when one of the dolphins brings up a human body part. There is a paranormal angle in it as both Brett and Lara begin to connect with the ghosts of the murdered woman (Maria) and her husband (Miguel). Being part of the Krewe of Hunters series, there are special agents who specialise in solving crimes with the help of ghosts. Apart from this there is an angle about medical research too. \n While it is an easy enough read, there are too many characters (on both sides of the good vs evil divide). The paranormal angle isn't spooky enough. Besides it is a bit of a stretch to imagine that not only the Krewe Hunters but Brett and Lara too are able to easily communicate with ghosts. The writing does not create enough suspense nor is there much of a romance angle. It's unlikely that I will ever read any other book in this series."}

{"text": "This book. THIS BOOK. I can barely put into words how I feel about this book. Our queen, Sarah J Maas, has done it once again and fashioned a novel so beautiful, heart-wrenching, and exciting that it is both a joy and a torture to read. And I mean torturous in the best way possible, as this book wreaks havoc on your emotions from start to finish. Think the previous book was intense? Empire of Storms blows it out of the water! Talk about a book full of romance, action and general badassery (for lack of a better word). Aelin Ashryver Galathynius continues to dazzle in this instalment, just as she did in its predecessors. She kicks butt and takes names and does whatever is necessary to protect the ones she loves and to better the lives of the people of Terrasen. \n While I must admit it took me a bit to get used to ToG world again months after I finished Queen of Shadows, once I got back into the swing of things, I could not put it down! My heart was racing at every turn-at points when I thought I'd have a moment to rest, my emotions were put into overdrive as something INSANE occurred. I won't get into details, for the sake of remaining spoiler-free, but Aelin faces more adversity in this book then I thought was even possible and yet never crumbles under the pressure. She is a heroine for the ages and I cannot wait to see what fate (and Maas) have in store for her! I will somehow find ways to fill this terrible void Empire of Storms has left within me until next year, when Maas graces us with the next book of Aelin and her court's enthralling story."}

So it gets pretty interesting. He also has suspicious people after him and possibly trying to kill him. Of course, the gang is trying to protect him and find out who is after him. \n Jace and Clary's relationship gets to heat up a little, it seems like as soon as they're able to be together, something is always holding one of them back. I'm kind of getting annoyed with it, I just hate Jace's constant need to keep himself away from Clary. Even though he loves her, Clary is just hurt by it and Jace is miserable. I just think they need to be together and forget everthing and everyone else. Isn't that how is suppose to be?

But then things have to get all complicated, and then there's a confusing time jump, and then in the last few pages something supernatural happens with zero foreshadowing.

But the welcome distraction soon turns into a nightmare when Kelly Prescott tells her that she won't be naming Suze as her VP this year, because she's going to name the new guy. The new guy who just happens to be Paul Slater. The guy who almost left her for dead over the summer in the shadowland.

{"text": "I have very weird feelings about this book right now, and I wasn't sure if I was going to write a review. I started out absolutely loving this book and every single character, but as I read more and more, I think I liked it less and less? I'm not sure if that's really how I feel or if it was just a lot of reading in a short amount of time, but I didn't finish this book feeling like I usually do after finishing a Cassandra Clare book. At first I loved every single character so much, but (super unpopular opinion) I don't like Mark at all. I completely sympathize with what he's gone through and I feel bad for the guy, but he made me so angry and reading from his POV was so boring and made me madder. As I read, I decided I just really really loved Julien and he DOES NOT get enough recognition and love and people give him such a hard time for the dumbest reasons and I will defend him until I die. I liked that in this book our main character was a Shadowhunter already so we didn't have to go through the whole explanation and discovery of the shadow world again because it would have been so repetitive for me at this point. However, I think the main reason I wasn't as captivated with this book was because I didn't like the plot line and the villain as much as I like the plot lines in her other novels. I thought it was very interesting, but it moved way too slowly to the point where I was really just reading for the character relationships and not the plot at all. I couldn't believe that the mystery of Emma's parents deaths was solved in book one! That just felt so anticlimactic and simple to me considering that is the conflict our main character starts the story with. I do think the ending was very promising and will create a good conflict for our main characters for the rest of the series.

I like to use my imagination regarding how the characters lives play out once the novels are over. Also, with how the novel ended I didn't think the epilogue was necessary.

And in some ways it really wasn't. After what Ever went through in the last book, she is stronger than she has been in the previous four novels. Seriously I was surprised by how confident she was and I thought for sure that when she had her first confrontation with Haven that everything that she had been working for during the summer would have been wasted. But she walked away and went straight to Damen and they talked. Then when Miles finds out about what Ever, Haven and Damen really are she talks with him too. And hell, she even talks to Jude to make sure that he's going to be okay if Haven comes for him and she's not there to protect him."}

{"text": "Oh my word, I just don't even really know where to begin. \n Broken Shell Island is positively filled with fun and amusement. I found myself constantly laughing, shaking my head unable to believe what I was reading. \n It was almost like a guilty pleasure. The utter absurdity of everything made it extremely easy to constantly suspend disbelief. I mean, come on - Pixies pee on hair. Chalk makes doors. Suitcases navigate. Seriously. \n It ran the full gamut from glorious to gross. \n Characters - \n Here is what I liked most. Even though the world itself was very believably unbelievable and filled with absurd and hilarious magic, the characters were consistently easy to relate to, unique and well developed. I liked Opal and connected with her almost immediately. I did at times think she acted younger than her age, but after a while I forgot she was supposed to be 15 and just took her as she was. \n World building - This book's world building is what will make it a classic. It is so well developed and well thought out. \n Plot - Almost all the plot threads wind up being tied up nicely. You may be thinking you have it all figured out while reading but don't be too sure of yourself. This book is anything but predictable. \n Quality of writing and editing - This is a self published title that can easily stand with any traditionally publish novel. Top notch. \n Now, generally speaking, I am not a fan of humor. Because of this I had to be in the right mind to read this, as it really isn't serious at all. \n Also, as a parent I feel the need to add that while early on it seems like this would be a great title for children because of the mere fantastical elements and seemingly lighthearted story, it isn't appropriate for the young ones. I would say probably 12 or 13 and up it should be fine. There are a few mature themes and references. I have an 8 year old and while I think she could handle the writing itself and it would probably hold her attention, I don't want her coming to me and asking \"Mommy, what's a virgin?\" Also, a reference to \"doing it.\" (worded as such to come from the POV of a child.) Really these were the only things that would give me pause on the younger children reading it. \n The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I don't consider it something that I would have to read again and again and again. It's just my personal review style that only books that will become my new classics that I have to reread simply for the experience receive 5 stars."}

{"text": "Beth ha sfidato le regole del cielo per amare Xavier ma proprio il loro amore ha contribuito a rilegare le forze oscure all'inferno! \n In questo secondo capitolo della trilogia di Alexandra Adornetto, troviamo i nostri protagonisti esattamente dove li avevamo lasciati alla fine di Rebel: Beth e Xavier, con gli studenti studenti della Bryce Hamilton, partecipano al party di Halloween in una casa disabitata nei pressi di Venus Cove. E Beth, suo malgrado, e coinvolta dalle sue amiche Molly, Abby e Savannah in una seduta spiritica. Purtroppo, inavvertitamente, si apre un varco che permette alle creature oscure di farsi largo nuovamente sulla Terra. Infatti dall'Ade torna proprio Jake Thorn, che con un'abile messa in scena riesce a rapire Beth e la trascina, attraverso il portale, all'Inferno. \n Beth non sa nemmeno quello che la aspetta... l'Ade e un luogo terrificante e buio, l'odore acre dello zolfo riempie l'aria, il sole non esiste e l'orizzonte e un groviglio di nebbia fitta e grigiastra. E circondata da anime dannate che sono vittime di un'agonia indicibile, torturate in un ciclo perpetuo che sana temporaneamente le loro ferite per permettere ai torturatori di infliggerne delle nuove ogni giorno! \n Orribile e lacerante per lei, un angelo che sa alleviare il dolore con il solo tocco delle mani... \n Non solo, ma in questo luogo, dove la speranza non esiste, vivono demoni che si dilettano in ogni genere di peccato capitale. E' un susseguirsi di azioni violente e abbiette che mirano solo ad arrecare piacere a soddisfazioni a Lucifero o come lo chiamano i suoi figli \"Papa Luci (assurdo aggiungo!) \n Ed e proprio per il dover obbedire al volere dello stesso Lucifero che Jake porta Beth all'Inferno... vuole che diventi la principessa del terzo cerchio del regno dell'Ade. \n In realta, Lucifero ha intenzione di scatenare l'Apocalisse e usa il rapimento di Beth come una sfida al Regno dei Cieli... un angelo relegato all'Inferno rendera le anime dannate piu motivate alla guerra. \n Beth, separata da Xavier, e sempre piu debole fisicamente ed emotivamente, angosciata dall'orrore che la circonda. Sola e senza la possibilita di fuggire, vive le sue giornate chiusa in una suite d'albergo, sorvegliata dalle guardie di Jake. Ma, inaspettatamente, Beth instaura un legame di fiducia e affetto con Hanna, la giovane cameriera che si occupa di lei. Anche il suo sorvegliante personale, Tucker, si rivelera una persona fidata, perche aiutera Beth a far visita ai suoi cari con il suo spirito, ogni volta che lei lo desidera. \n Proprio questo salto che Beth fa con l'anima sulla Terra, permette di conoscere i movimenti e i progressi che Gabe, Ivy e Xavier fanno nella sua ricerca. \n Fughe repentine, oscure possessioni ed angeli supremi che entrano in gioco quando oramai tutto e quasi risolto, rendono il finale di Sacrifice interessante ma alquanto prevedibile! \n In questo secondo capitolo la Adornetto cambia il suo stile narrativo. Abbandonati i toni leggeri e romantici di Rebel, adesso la narrazione si fa piu cupa e cruda proprio come il regno che descrive, l'Inferno. \n Ebbene si, con una mossa a sorpresa dell'antagonista, l'autrice riesce a catapultarci dritti nelle viscere della Terra, un luogo oscuro e opprimente pervaso da orrore e peccato, uno scenario ben diverso da quello presentato nel primo libro. Ma, secondo il mio avviso, anche questa volta non sfrutta a pieno le potenzialita della trama. Le sue descrizioni, all'inizio interessanti, man mano si dilungano capitolo dopo capitolo, non accade niente di eclatante alla protagonista, dopo il colpo di scena iniziale. Un aspetto interessante introdotto dall'autrice e il trasmigrare dell'anima di Beth, ottimo appiglio, secondo me, per conoscere i fatti che coinvolgono i suoi fratelli e Xavier rimasti sulla Terra. Anche se questo continuo cambio di scena non da alla trama novita molto rilevanti, anzi il tanto atteso aiuto ai protagonisti arriva quasi alla fine e fa apparire il finale molto prevedibile. \n Beth, l'angelo dolce e innamorato in Rebel, non riesce ad essere una protagonista di rilievo all'interno del libro e persino i suoi fratelli sembrano brancolare letteralmente nel buio mentre cercano un modo per salvarla (tutto questo potere a mio avviso inutilizzato!). Invece proprio Xavier questa volta mi ha sorpresa piacevolmente.... deciso, caparbio e coraggioso, questo ragazzo fronteggia persino il male in persona per difendere la sua Beth! \n E che dire dello splendido antagonista Jake, il principe dell'Ade! Usato dall'autrice solo come mezzo di trasporto per condurre Beth e il lettore in un altro scenario, per poi diventare una figura ovvia, senza sfumature, un'anima che ha solo bisogno di essere amata dall'angelo che ha rapito -.- (scontato come la domenica dopo il sabato!) \n I personaggi di Hanna e di Tucker sono invece ben caratterizzati e inseriti nella storia. Nonostante il loro passato doloroso, riescono a trasmettere fiducia e coraggio alla protagonista. Lo scettro del peggiore va indubbiamente a Lucifero. Come puo incutere timore e rispetto un demone che si fa chiamare dai suoi figli Papa Luci? Il male in persona, il mandante di tutto, appare come un uomo di mezza eta che cerca di scacciare la noia progettando l'Apocalisse senza troppa convinzione! \n Uno scenario nuovo, demoni e anime dannate e il piu splendente fra gli gli arcangeli sarebbero stati sufficienti a rendere Sacrifice un bel libro... ma se a tutto cio non si uniscono una trama vivace e la coerenza dei personaggi, il tutto risulta appena passabile e poco entusiasmante. \n Se proprio siete ostinati ad intraprendere questa lettura aspettate almeno l'edizione economica..."}

{"text": "Aliens!!! Hot Aliens!!! My interests were pretty peaked when this came out. I definitely knew I had to read this, considering Armentrout is known to write hella great paranormal romance novels! Lets just start off by saying how funny and addictive this book was, from the start when Katy met Daemon, to Dee in the parking lot... I loved it! Daemon really is hot, sexy, and stab-worthy!! I have never been more infuriated by a character than Daemon. He is the arrogant, 'too cool for this' type of guy and just a straight out jerk when he meets Katy. Dee, being his twin sister isn't having any of this and makes him play nice. Thank you Dee!! \n This was such a thrilling ride, from hot jerks, to evil aliens trying to kill them, then lots and lots of touching... yes, definitely worth the read. Of course, having spend time with Dee and unfortunately, Daemon, Katy starts to notice off things about the pair. Also the fact theres ANOTHER twin family that's always around them. When Katy gets attacked by the Arum, a race of beings dedicated to wiping out Daemon and his kind, Daemon then reveals himself to protect her. Unfortunately that results in Katy being marked by the alien magic he used, lighting her up for all and any alien/Arum to see and track. Way to go Daemon. \n Of course, Armentrout adds in some high school drama, and Katy isn't the only female that's close to Daemon either, just so happens to be his on and off again alien girlfriend, yikes. I cringe every time Ash is in the picture, because we all know who's going to end up with Daemon so... \n This was such a quick, fun read and so worth it! I loved this book and the series, so GO CHECK IT OUT!! \n IF you liked this review, check out more YA and other genre books on my blog! \n http://keepcalmandloveboooks.blogspot.ca"}
{"text": "I am happy to report this book is just as great as book one. It builds on the first book and sets the stage for the third in a deeply satisfying way while also having a well constructed beginning, middle and end of its own. \n Character development remains excellent, and the moral and intellectual sophistication of the narrative remains intact. These books are simultaneously mentally and emotionally engaging. The world building is so great I feel totally immersed in the book's universe. I can't wait to read book three!"}

{"text": "I attended a book conference at the end of October (NCIBA) and was intrigued when I picked up Fracture and had not heard of it yet. It is definitely my type of book - though it's not entirely contemporary as I first thought. \n I was immediately interested in Delaney's life - we know from the summary of the book that she falls through the ice and it is a miracle she is alive. Instead of making us guess the details of the monumental event, Megan Miranda takes the time to set the scene and share the experience. I am really not a fan of books that skip over events that set up the rest of the book and force us to guess and assume things, so this was a great way for Fracture to start for me. \n As Delaney recovers from her accident and starts to notice things aren't quite right, Fracture morphs slightly into a mystery/paranormal from a straight contemporary, which would make it a great read for those weary of contemporary but wanting to explore the genre. \n Besides really liking Delaney, my other favorite part of Fracture is that it wasn't predictable. Besides what I knew about the book before reading, I was never sure where it was going to go. I was also kind of creeped out with Delaney's \"power\" which I was not expecting. \n Overall: great debut!"}
{"text": "A Mortal Song by Megan Crewe \n The premise behind A Mortal Song is amazing and makes it worth the read. Sora is a mortal girl who has been switched at birth with a kami (magical/goddess) child princess. This isn't to protect Sora but the kami princess, who's destined to save the kami at Mount Fuji with her amazing god powers. The story is told from the POV of Sora, the girl who grew up thinking she was a princess and is now getting replaced by a human girl. The worst part is that Sora has to train her replacement in the ways of magic before a horde of demons overruns the mountain and kills her adopted family, whom she loves even though they've lied to her her entire life. \n The premise is a heartbreaker, but the characters (especially Sora) never really gelled for me. Sora is a strange character for me. She had a lot of concrete details in her backstory, and I understood her motivation the entire time, but there was always something 'thin' about her. It was like she never thought about anything besides the plot. This story never forgets The Plot, so maybe that's what actually caused me to feel uninterested in the characters. There were a lot of moments where it just felt like it was 'going through the motions'. In fact, this reminds me a bit of how I felt about Heroine Complex, which was a story with a kickass concept that never really went beyond the conceptual idea for me. (I will say I thought the two main characters in Heroine Complex were more well-developed than the main characters in A Mortal Song. The world building of Heroine Complex ultimately grated on me more while A Mortal Song had elegant elements in how it built its world.) I would have preferred the story be a bit more twisty--maybe dare I say it...more of a hot mess--to breathe some life into it. The sections in Tokyo did drag, and for being at the center of the story, Sora often didn't feel like a main character. Everyone else in this story seemed to sideline her, which is part of her story as being the human child, but it made for a less interesting read than the 'kid with secret powers' story. Maybe I'm too fixated on that narrative, but I like my main character to feel like the freaking main character. A Mortal Song sometimes didn't feel like Sora's story. \n I'm not the type of reader to point out or loathe 'love triangles'. I tend to accept them as part of the story, but I really hated how forced the love stories were in A Mortal Song. I didn't feel much for either Takeo or Keiji, and the story always wanted to make these relationships more important. Maybe it's that I really wasn't feeling Sora as a character, which was why I didn't quite get attached to either of her romantic interests. I'm going to contrast this to Uprooted, where I was ridiculously attached to the main character's relationship; that come organically because I got the main character. If A Mortal Song could've made me care more about Sora, the rest of the story would've interested me more. Overall, this is a great YA fantasy piece, and if you like world-building and Asian mythology, this book could be a winner for you. \n Rating: 3 stars. Solid idea, but liked-not-loved the characters. Sora seemed really rigid for a first person POV character and none of the other characters 'stepped up' to become more interesting."}
{"text": "Crosspost: mytokyoblues.wordpress.com \n .. .:*deg.. .:*deg.. .:*deg.. .:*deg A fantastic reimagining of Cinderella. Suzume has gone through many hardships at such a young age. The death of her father and cousin haunt her. She is forced to live with her stepfather, Terayama, and mother, Yukiko. In this story, there are no wicked stepsisters and the Shadow Ball is not a charming escape to a better life. This story is about revenge, love, and magic. \n Suzume, I loved her! She is content with being plain looking. She had to endure so much pain. Her mother was very submissive and loyal to Terayama. Suzume couldn't talk to anyone about her feelings and resorted to cutting herself in order to cope. She has a gift of shadow weaving, she is very talented with her gift, but she was never aware of her powers. She is very determined, angsty, and stubborn. When she makes a plan, she wants to see it happen. She doesn't believe she deserves happiness and believes that the only way to atone for her sins is to avenge her fallen family. Though Suzume has to change her identity several times, she knew how to adapt and stay strong in order to survive. >=o<= \n Otieno, is Suzume's love interest. From the moment he saw her, he knew that she was \"the one\". He is not the prince, instead, he is close allies to the Moon Prince. He is also a talented shadow weaver. He became involved in Suzume's life when Terayama almost tried to kill her in order to get Otieno and his family's attention. He is Suzume's opposite, whereas Suzume believes she does not deserve love, he does. He is optimistic about their future and may I say, he has a lot of patience with her. Though Suzume tries to avoid him, he always finds a way to be with her. Lastly, biracial couple. Yassss!!! 9(*[?]*1) \n The magical fairy of this story would be Akira. Akira was the former Shadow Bride, who meets Suzume in jail. I really loved Akira, she was my favorite character. She was sassy and lovely. She was a legend among young children since the typical Shadow Bride isn't a courtesan. I really loved her relationship with Suzume. I thought it was so cute how the two of them decided to stay sisters. \n (*d*) Lord Terayama was my least favorite character. He got what he deserved in the end. I liked how the author gave him a backstory. He wasn't just some random background character that her mother remarries. He plays a crucial role in Suzume becoming a revenge fueled girl. But Suzume's mother, I was disappointed with the most. She tells her daughter that she loves her, but would rather listen to what her new husband says. She feels threaten when the attention is not on her. There were moments that showed how motherly she was, but most of the time, she wants to move on and forget all about the past. She never protects Suzume, ever. If I could describe her in one word it would be coward. \n The Moon Prince isn't the love interest, one would think since this is a Cinderella retelling. The Shadow Ball isn't the dreamy party of the year. In fact, the Shadow Ball is an event for one girl to become the prince's Shadow Bride. The winner of the Shadow Ball is to be with the prince, but could never marry for the rest of her life. I loved the world that the author created. It would have been cool if the author went into more detail about the moon kingdom. After reading the final chapter, I wanted more. I wanted to know the fate of Suzume and Otieno. But for now, I'll just imagine that they got their happily ever after. +(*b*)w \n Shadows On the Moon did remind me of Cinder by Marissa Meyer. I would recommend this story to fans of the Lunar Chronicles and pretty much anyone who loves a good revenge story. It's a standalone book too. There are no frustrating love triangles!!! \n Final Rating: (4.25) .. .:*deg.. .:*deg.. .:*deg.. .:*deg"}

{"text": "High Fantasy often faces the criticism that it is a poor reflection of the works that have gone before it, most notably Tolkien. By employing the same basic mythos with a highly Western European (and generally, British) composition, many chide that too much of fantasy falls into this trap and needs to be refreshed with something edgier, or something more original. The end result is generally a poor facsimile that inevitably fails to shine in comparison. \n \"A Guile of Dragons\" is not some mere copy. \n Yes, it employs many of the elements that we might quickly label a High Fantasy trope - dwarves, dragons, ancient terrors, and the name Merlin (or at least his son, Morlock). Its important to remember that it is not what elements a writer uses, but how they use them, that brings distinction. Enge does not treat these elements lightly - the history and culture of the dwarves alone are an integral part of this story, hinting at a depth we never see a bottom to. The shortness of the work (@300 pages) is belied by the depth and fullness of the characters that populate it. These are thick characters, populating the pages not because they fill a need but because it is their story to tell. \n Set as a prequel for Enge's character, Ambrosius, aka Morlock syr Theorn, \"A Guile of Dragons\" introduces us to a small cast of recurring characters, each of whom demonstrates a depth and fullness usually reserved for the titular character. Not having read the other books in this milieu proved to not be a problem - as a prequel, it is a well contained volume, beginning with the birth of Morlock, son of Merlin, and the circumstances that place young Morlock in the care of the dwarves of Thrymhaiam to the north. This is also the story of Morlock's first real adventure (other feats are alluded to, but nothing so grand), following a metre and pace that is reminiscent of a classic saga even when the story telling is modern. \n For in the Northold, the dwarves find themselves cut off from the Graith of Guardians as a guile of dragons invades, reigniting the Longest War from before the dawn of history. Morlock, a thaen of the Graith, adopted son of the dwarves, trapped between both worlds, faces the failings of each as he is thrust into battling the dragons themselves. \n Enge, who's unsecret real world identity is a classics professor, demonstrates that a writer is influenced by the books and life you lead. \"A Guile of Dragons\" is a worthy epic for any fantasy reader, containing a surprising depth and fullness that is rarely found in so short a book. I cannot say more about this book without spoiling it, so I will just say that I wholly and heartily recommend that it be read."}
{"text": "Every book in Lindsay Buroker's Emperor's Edge series is a delight. This first one particularly entertained me so much that I considered it the funniest and most touching book I'd read in ages. Protagonist Amaranthe shows humility and courage as she leads her motley team in defense of the deposed Emperor. Buroker's characters are well rounded, consistent and complement each other, and come from the real world, being fallible but willing to do their best. The steampunk world and the politics of power-mongering become clearer as the stories progress. Action and reflection balance and ground the plot, and the pacing is just right. As well, the romance between Amaranthe and the Assassin shows up just enough to twig our interest but does not take over the whole story, and this love relationships moves through reasonable and heart-warming developments as time goes on. I heartily recommend this book and the entire series to those who love a good story and care about the clash of good and evil."}
{"text": "While the series did not end how I was hoping...Braving the Darkness concludes the series nicely.

{"text": "After anxiously awaiting this year's new Picoult book, I was pretty bummed to see that it was a YA novel, filled with pictures and a fairy-tale plot, and half-written by somebody that didn't write as gloriously as my favorite author of all time, ever. \n AND YET. \n It wasn't all that bad. It was pretty damn good, actually, for what it aimed to be. It's a story for teenagers--falling in love for the first time, coming to accept and love yourself despite your flaws. With that said, nothing of significant importance was imparted to me upon my quick read of this at Barnes and Noble today (a comfy seat in the cafe, a large Hot Chocolate and I wiped this bad boy out). It didn't pack anywhere near the amount of punch that Jodi's best novels sometimes do, but it was sweet. I laughed out loud a few times--to the disapproval of my Cafe neighbors--and read my sister full paragraphs that I thought were cute. But that's about the extent of it."}

{"text": "I would have given this three and a half stars if I'd had the option, since it was better than the second book. For one thing, it actually resolved and the plot twists at the end were genious. For another, the way Mr. Beddor used the caterpillars in this one was very clever. \n Every once in a while I felt disoriented reading it because the cast of characters was so large, and naturally, when you have that many characters it's impossibly to adequetly spend enough time on all of them. The sound effects in the text continued to annoy me and I still found myself wishing for more indepth insights into the main character's thoughts. I found the budding romance between Alyss and Dodge lacking, but then, it's clear this isn't a romantic book but more of an action tough-boy read. Maybe I'm just in the wrong genre. \n Overall, I enjoyed the series and admired the author's imagination."}
{"text": "See full review for Spirit Bound at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n Like with the other two times I've read this book, my emotions are in a constant roller coaster and it starts right on page one. Dimitri is still sending Rose 'love letters' that basically say that she completely screwed up by not making sure that he was really dead on that bridge, they could have had forever, but he has to kill her now and he will find her no matter where she goes. Thankfully, after that, things kind of mellow out. Rose graduates, goes to Court and tries to figure out her next move. She breaks into a prison and kidnaps Victor Dashkov - the guy who tries to kill Lissa - and then she goes to Vegas to meet Victor's half-brother and interrogate him about if he brought a Strigoi back to life. Plot twist, he did do it, but a dhampir can't. The spirit user has to. Emotional high again when Dimitri shows up to take out Rose, but in the end they both fail."}

She will never be immortal and in her eyes she's temporary. She hates her parents for doing this to her and refuses to do anything that they say - and you thought you had issues with your parents when you were a teenager. Sheesh.

{"text": "This one is a perfect blend of snark, fantasy and swoon! \n MY DATE FROM HELL begins where it should--with Sophie being tortured within an inch of her life by her dad, Zeus. Family, ain't it grand? \n Still Sophie--a reincarnation of Persephone--can't reclaim the memories she's being tortured to divulge. So she battles on. In the process she frees herself, and Kai--Kyrillos, son of Hades--who is likewise up for execution. Sophie returns to her Vancouver boarding school to learn her magically-enhanced-bully, Bethany, is poised to claim supreme star-status with the help of Hermes--god of tricksters. \n Oh, and Sophie has less than two months to regain Persephone's memories and fall in love with Kai, or humanity is doomed. But Sophie can't seem to let go of her fears that Kai will only love her for Persephone's sake, and not her own. And that's kinda not so okay with Sophie. \n Though Eros and Aphrodite toss in some magic, Sophie can't overcome her own romantic notion that a person should be really in love, not simply faking it. Kai gets it, and he'd like to let her know his own feelings on the matter, but hey, gods have their pride. \n In order to unravel Persephone's memories, Sophie turns to master caster-Hephestus-also known by his hipster name, Festos. And, he's game to help if Sophie can maybe sway Theo into looking his way again. Oh, and Eros volunteers to rescue the brain-drain, but it's gonna hurt. So the merry bunch takes off after Hermes, on a date arranged by Aphrodite, to cut the cord on Bethany's villainous popularity. \n The date between Sophie and Kai soon becomes a Game of Death to rescue Hannah and gain Hermes' cooperation. Along the way Sophie begins to see that Kai isn't all bubbly over Persephone any longer. No, he's realized that Sophie's a pretty extraordinary gal--what with her snark and her magic powers and her saving the day. In fact, Sophie's willingness to accept Kai is what returns Persephone's memories. Now she knows who tried to kill her years ago in Hades. \n And, sadly, that person is back to finish the job."}
{"text": "This review was written for Joyfully Jay Reviews and can be accessed here: http://joyfullyjay.com/2016/05/review... \n 3.5 Stars. \n Stumptown Spirits is an interesting, contemporary reconnection romance that also features some paranormal elements. While the premise was excellent, I felt as if the execution didn't quite hit the mark. \n Riley and Logan were serious boyfriends--on the verge of a marriage proposal--when Logan disappeared from Riley's apartment and life in what may have been a staged scene of infidelity. Riley's life seemed to implode after this incident. He walked away from completing his Master's degree in folklore studies, only to land a \"research\" job with his best friend, Julie, a production assistant on a third-rate \"Ghost Hunter\"-type cable program. Riley is a glorified gofer, but he's got a great story that might gain him some well-deserved respect: the Stumptown Ghost War, a legend he first heard from Logan, the night they met in fact. \n Logan's roots in Portland, OR, go deep. His grandfather, a WWII vet, was vilified after he claimed to witness a spectral ghost battle in a secluded park--a battle where one of his friends got pulled into the fight and vanished from existence. Then, six years ago, Logan took his college roommate and sexytime-friend, Trent, out to see the ghosts, and Trent got sucked into the vortex, too. Logan had nearly given up devising a plan to save Trent, when he met Riley. Being with Riley was all he had ever longed for, and Riley--who is a bit mousy and has an Elmer Fudd speech impediment--counted himself uber-lucky to have such a sexy boyfriend. \n Riley and his TV crew show up in Portland to film the Ghost War, and Riley and Logan reconnect. It's not pretty. It does get gritty. And that's kinda where I got wrong-footed on the book. \n Riley's a smart man, but he lets Logan mistreat him. He makes excuses that he knows are unreasonable, mostly because he believes Logan's hiding something big. And, he is. Instead of trusting Riley, he hides and hides and hides his involvement and personal stake in the ghost war. Riley is smart, however, and he reads between the lines. He figures out not only what Logan won't tell him, but also how to turn the tide and keep Logan safe, while also righting old wrongs and saving innocents. \n If only Logan wasn't such a giant horse's ass. Really. Because he's got a gargantuan Hero Complex and blistering Martyr Complex, his efforts to keep Riley from danger are nothing short of ham-handed and ridiculous. I gave him the benefit of the doubt for 75% of the book, but after that I mostly wanted to punch him. Logan's redemption, if one could call it that, is that Riley never gives up, Logan really DOES love Riley, and external forces luckily converge serendipitously to save the day, and that was not cool, for me. I wanted Logan to wise up, cooperate with Riley, and be a real hero, not a moron. The one thing I can say is, he does the right thing in the end, even if it's long after the peril was over. So, it's an HEA. \n I got real tired of the bullying Riley suffers from the TV host. I can't even, with all the stereotyping. And I was aggravated by the lack of real physical connection between Riley and Logan. There's one scene of sexytimes, and it's almost heartbreaking, and I mean that in the sad and lonely, one-last-time way that always makes me maudlin. The book is set up for a sequel, with Riley and Logan on the hunt for another ghostly adventure. I'd be interested to see if these guys finally got their act together, or if they are destined to fall into the recurring legendary errors that Riley so diligently studies."}
{"text": "I wish there were enough words for me to describe how much I loved and adored this book, but at the moment words are failing me so forgive me if this review isn't up to my usual standards. A Court of Wings and Ruin (ACOWAR) was probably my number one anticipated book of 2017 and after the way ACOMAF ended I wasn't sure how I was going to be able to get through the months of wait. I somehow managed and ridiculously cursed myself when I got a stack of library books to read the week before ACOWAR's release. But when I did finally get through that stack of books and started this, I was a little hesitant at first. What if ACOWAR didn't live up to my high expectations and fell into that 'final books of series doldrums?' \n But I should have know that Maas wouldn't let it. She created a wonderful roller coaster of a novel.To read the rest of this review go here https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... but there are spoilers ahead!"}
{"text": "I started off reading this book not thinking TOO much of it; I expected a fun read that I'd enjoy, but nothing too major. It also didn't help when I glanced over the first three reviews which at the time that I write this review foreshadowed some very poor writing or plot. \n It didn't take me very long to realize how wrong they were. I'm not sure what it is, especially with Americans, that racism and feminism seem to be huge topics among just about anything. It seems to me that America (and I'm not saying this as an outsider, I've lived here most of my life) is so obsessed with not offending anything and making everything equal that they make mountains out of molehills- the fact that Chloe was black and that Galen was attractive and protective of Emma. \n Newflash people: It's not racist, and it's not sexist. As much as one may want to deny it, black women like Chloe do exist. I'm friends with plenty. Others unlike Chloe do as well. Chloe's fate in the story was for the sake of the plot, not blatant racism. Get over yourselves. As for Galen, I imagine that a man who isn't worried and protective of a woman, isn't in love with her either. There's nothing restricting and abusive about Emma and Galen. In fact, I went through this book smiling and musing happily about how it took the few positive similarities from Twilight, and had none of the '50s housewife attitude. \n That being said, it didn't take long for me to become enthralled with the book. The writing is easy to follow and intriguing, making for a fast and enjoyable read. I loved all the characters- though Rayna's a bit much. She, however, showed some satisfying character development. \n The only real thing that bothered me was the switch between point of view. I'm not sure why we couldn't have Galen in first person, but I got over it after a few chapters. I'm the type of person who isn't bothered by much but I am able to recognize something that isn't okay- I didn't see any problems with the book. \n After being enthralled, pretty much every page made me a little more attached to the characters and the plot. Not to mention I didn't see a good amount of the events coming; the last three pages, just wow. I knew there would be something up to complicate Galen and Emma's relationship, naturally, but I didn't see that happening specifically. Maybe I should have. But it was subtle enough to demand much respect. \n I cannot wait for Of Triton to come out - I'm much looking forward for it. Kudos."}

{"text": "Scarlett is a girl and farmer living in a small town in France. Her grandmother, who has raised her, has disappeared and Scarlet believes that she has been kidnapped. The police have stopped looking, and she's desperate to find some sort of clue. When she finds her father at her farm looking for something to give the kidnappers, she finds out that he was also taken and tortured, but her grandma refused to give them what they wanted, so they release them. When she questions him about their captors, all he knows is that they have weird tattoos. She recalls a guy with a similar tattoo named Wolf, a street fighter that helped her earlier that day. He tells her he was part of a gang that is trying to find information about Princess Selene, and that they've taken her grandmother because she was a pilot that went to the moon just before the attack on the princess. She asks him to take her to Paris to find the gang and rescue her grandma, and Wolf decides to help her. Meanwhile, Cinder escapes with the help of another convict named Thorne, and now they have a ship and can travel to Africa to find Dr. Erland. She's scared and she wants answers, so she decides to find a pilot in France that may have the answers about how she came to Earth and what happened to her in her first years. \n I liked Scarlet as a character, and I also liked Thorne, Cinder and Kai. Having their point of views was fun and made the book more fast paced. Wolf was ok, I wasn't a big fan most of the time but I don't dislike him. I loved how strong and determined Scarlet was and how she didn't get side tracked for anything. Her priority was finding her grandma. \n The development was predictable because we know Red Riding Hood's story. Wolf betraying Scarlet, her grandma dying. I didn't expect him to work for the Lunar Empire, but it was obvious there was something supernatural about him and his \"gang\", and the fact that Scarlet doesn't get suspicious was disappointing. It sucks that they also killed her father, she didn't get to reconcile with him or at least forgive him. \n You can see how Cinder is struggling with her destiny and duty, how she wants to know more about herself but is terrified about her role. \n It was also fun to see how Cinder's and Scarlet's story connect and by the end of the book they've formed this wanted/saving the world team (or \"pack\"). Can't wait to see what happens next and what Erland has planned for Cinder!"}
{"text": "Keara and her world are so well described and imagined that I fell into it and didn't want to come out. \n My only issue with this book is that it's not marketed as a part 1 or a trilogy, so the ending come pretty abruptly and leaves you hanging.

{"text": "Here we are, back again in the wonderful world Richelle Mead created. This book started off right on Sydney Sage at home being awakened by her alchemist bosses. Sydney's home life is a rough one, to say the least. Her father is horrible to her, he treats them like crap, and her sister is just so annoying. Zoe wants to do anything to make her dad proud, even if that means going on a mission that'll most likely get her killed, when she's only 15 years old. Of course, Sydney sees how obscure this is, and offers herself considering she knows more about the Moroi and Strigoi from her little escapade with Rose and Dimitri in Blood Promises and Last Sacrifice. Well, you can understand how upset Zoe was and accused Sydney of wanting all the glory to herself, yeah.. not really. What a brat. \n Anyways, flip forward a couple chapters and Sydney is back with the gang!!! Sydney, along with an annoying 'supervisor/partner' Keith Darnell, the golden boy of the alchemists. She meets up with Rose, Dimitri, Adrian, Eddie, Jill, and weirdly enough, Abe Mazur, Rose's father and someone Sydney has clearly met and made a deal with before, -gasp- mystery. Sydney and Jill move to Amberwood Prep to protect the newly found royalty, Jill, after many suspicious attacks made on her life. \n This novel was super juicy and totally fun to read. It never once got boring and I flew through it in one sitting. Adrian is a huge character in this series, which I'm glad for considering he didn't really get much in Vampire Academy. The others do make appearances once in a while but the book is solely about Sydney and her new life hiding out with Jill, Keith and Adrian. While, this book was pretty predictable, it did have its twists and surprises later on in the book and in the whole series. Adrian's lines were hilarious of course, so we still had the humour. Sydney's P.O.V was definitely different from Roses. Sydney's would be smarter, critical and more serious while Rose's was funny, witty, and sarcastic. Aside from that, this book was pretty darn great! I had fun reading it and definitely reading the rest of the series. \n IF you liked this review, check out more on my blog where I review other YA and genre books! \n http://keepcalmandloveboooks.blogspot.ca"}

The twists, which one would think would have gotten old by book six of a series, twisted into areas that I still didn't expect them to. The action was non-stop, and even when you did get a reprieve I took a deep breath with my characters and enjoyed it because I knew that it wasn't going to last. \n I've read some of the reviews for this series before I started it, and a lot people complained that there wasn't a lot of character development and that was a big reason they didn't like it. I have to disagree. The character development in these books is just fantastic. I sort of envy Caine's ability to develop these characters over an arc of books like she does. I can barely do it over fifteen chaptered stories."}

{"text": "#5 Best Sellers of all time, estimated 150 million copies sold (Source: Wikipedia.org) \n With this title, J.R.R. Tolkien became the only author to have two titles in the top 13 best selling titles of all time. This list consists of individual titles that have sold 100m+ copies. While The Hobbit makes the list at 100m, and assumes the #9 spot, The Fellowship of the Ring secures the #5 spot with an estimated 150m copies sold. This makes his work on Middle-earth one of the best selling series for adults of all time (Harry Potter, Goosebumps, Berenstain Bears, Sweet Valley High, etc were not written for adults). You should probably read The Hobbit (#9 Best Sellers of all time) first, as it was published first, in 1937, and its events are the foundation for these next chapters of Middle-earth history. \n I have to confess, the first time I read \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" I found it somewhat tedious. The plot was interesting, but the weight of the history of Middle-Earth, the numerous characters/ locations, and series of magical implements, was overwhelming. Nonetheless, I persevered, and I'm glad I did. Knowing what I know now, I would say to myself: \n \"Self, this is a book to be read multiple times. It is a classic because the themes and symbols work simultaneously on various levels. Don't try to comprehend Middle-earth completely as you read, but rather, be prepared to be swept away to a different world and enjoy it anew each time you visit.\" \n Once one has embraced the transformation, the amazing settings, endearing characters, and mythic themes are truly enchanting. Since that first exposure, the trilogy has drawn me back many times since, and I enjoy sharing it with others, and our children. \n You will note as you read, a peculiarity in Tolkien's use of language. This is a key part of the immersive nature of the Middle-earth world. It's not just that Tolkien creates several languages for different races (the Elvin language is particularly famous), but it's the way he uses the English language to create a chimeric rhythm, vocabulary and setting that runs in a river parallel and yet distinct from the Earth we know. This vision of creating a unique narrative voice drove both Tolkien -- and his editors (who learned that their 'helpful' changes were considered corruptions by Tolkien)-- to unprecedented levels of reviews and revisions. \n The Peter Jackson movie on this title was not only a huge success, but a mostly faithful account of the story line, language, history and settings of Middle-earth. Of course, the book is better, and sales indicate many were lead to discover the text either in preparation for or continued exploration after the movie was released. This is a huge win, because not only was this book a best seller, it represents some of the finest fictional writing in the English language and deserves it's status as an enduring classic. If you've only watched the movie/s, take the plunge and read the book/s! \n To start at the beginning, see \n The Hobbit, Tolkien, 1937 \n https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... \n To continue the journey, see \n Two Towers (Lord of the Rings #2), Tolkien, 1954 \n https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... \n Want to read #4 best seller of all time?

{"text": "Carry On is not original. It's not game-changing. It's not terribly literary. \n But by God this was one of the most entertaining and fun books I have read in a while. \n I have read a lot of complaints that this is basically just a lesser \"Harry Potter.\" And it is, kind of. This is Rainbow Rowell's take on Harry Potter. You will find so many similarities in her world and characters with that of Rowling. But at the same time, it is Rowell's take on \"the chosen one\" story, on typical YA romance, on YA tropes in general. There are a many great satirical moments in this, poking fun at everything from Harry Potter and Twilight to John Green, if you look hard enough. \n But Rowell does not get bogged down by satirizing these stories. She has fun with these tropes, and as the novel progresses, she really makes these elements her own and above all weaves them together to create an exciting story for the reader. \n Yes, there is a wizarding school. There is a chosen one. There is a nemesis. There is a mentor. There are vampires. There is romance. There's a lot of of stuff. But as you keep reading, you notice that Rowell gradually starts casting them aside. She is more interested in telling her own story and really working to create her own characters. \n This had everything that worked with Eleanor and Park and nothing that didn't. She has a terrific romance here and expertly executes the multiple POVs. But in addition to that, she creates in incredibly tight and interconnected plot that really works at building mystery, suspense, and intrigue. \n To put it simply, this is an engaging and entertaining story that Rowell tells with absolute expertise. It didn't change my life, but it made the past 5 days absolute fly by like a book has not done in a while. And that deserves 5 stars in my mind."}

All went well until one night when she gets badly hurt by an ancient fae and Ren, the new one in the Order, finds her bleeding on the steps. \n Ren is on a special mission and he's not exactly working for the Order but he's definitely working on something....when denying gets harder by the minute because Ren and Ivy spend a lot of 'work' time together, working to in Ivy's pants and vise versa is as well on the agenda LOL. \n \"And why do you've have to be so grabby? Jesus.\" \n \"I like the way you feel against me,\" he said. \n \"You're going to have to get to know me better before you taste my cake.\" \n \"Was that an invitation? Because I'm willing to get to know you in any way possible if that means I gt to taste your cake.\" \n Uhm yeah... what was I about to write? \n Oh yeah, I enjoyed this book tremendously. I liked the lighthearted humor, the snarky back and forth comments, the supernatural story-line, and of course the characters themselves. This is a fun page-turner with a sweet love story developing on the side and with Jennifer's famous plot twists and turns. I didn't see the ending coming and can honestly say the first thing I'll click this summer is Torn, book 2 in the series. \n If you enjoy YA paranormal romance with less drama, but some steamy scenes, great surprises in the plot, a plot that is more than a page turner then I highly suggest this new PNR series. \n Oh and before I forget, hands down, TINK is by far my favorite side-character ever! I laughed so hard I had tears....such a funny little fellow - you will love him! \n \"Tell me yes,\" he ordered huskily. \"Tell me yes and I'll do whatever you want. Anything you want. Just let me do this.\" \n ___________________________________ \n Read all my review (A-Z) on the blog \n Like the blog on Facebook \n Email subscription to my blog"}

The Luxen have landed and they don't want to leave anytime soon and they're destroying everything in their wake. Kat, Archer, Beth, and Luc are tucked away in the cabin not sure what to do. Dee, Dawson, and Daemon are gone, they left when the Luxen landed. Not sure what they're next move should be Katy is blown away when she learns that Beth is pregnant and Archer and her go out to get supplies. This is where they run into a group of Luxen destroying things and assimilating human bodies. Archer and Katy are about to escape and get the hell out of dodge when she feels Daemon, but instead she runs into Dawson. \n The next thing she knows she's waking up in a mansion surrounded by Luxen who are less than friendly, even her best friend Dee is against her. Turns out that the Luxen are all connected by their thoughts and when the new guys showed up, the leader infiltrated all their thoughts and brainwashed them into thinking that humans were evil and deserved to be subjugated. So what does that mean for Dawson and Daemon? It doesn't look good when Katy finally sees him again, he treats her like she's nothing but human trash and their love was nothing."}

{"text": "Imagine that your friend invited you to his/her house and when you get there, there is a group of people playing D&D or some kind of RPG and you just want to sit and watch it. \n This is the vibe of Gardens of the Moon. \n I think what people actually find complicated in this book is the amount of characters - because there is a lot of them. My way to deal with that was to get the list of characters from Wikipedia and keep close while reading. \n The way Steven Erikson don't just give you all the information and make you really pay close attention to the dialogue and the events and how the characters reacts to them is truly the art of a D&D Master."}
{"text": "See full review for Gone at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n Janie knows that she is a dream catcher. She has the weird ability to go inside people's dreams and change them if they ask for her help. But with this strange ability comes a price. If she uses it too long, she will eventually go blind like the others before her - most before their twenty-fifth birthday. She will also lose the mobility of her hands and legs. But she has accepted that fact. \n What she hasn't accepted is the fact of what this will do to her boyfriend Cabel who has been there for her over the last nine months. He's having dreams about what her disabilities are going to do to him and it's scaring her. Enough that she's thinking about breaking up with him, leaving the police force, and finding isolation somewhere where she can be safe. But even that might have its own problems she soon learns when her mother gets a phone call that changes Janie's plan... \n Okay, so here is my big complaint about this book. There wasn't enough of Cabel in it. I understand that he wasn't in it because Janie was trying to make this huge decision, but c'mon. The girl needs to listen to the Captain and talk to him about what's going on with her. He can't read minds."}

{"text": "Highly enjoyable read and every bit as good as the first. Better even in that book 2 takes you on a whirlwind adventure and then leaves you on the edge of the cliff waiting for the third installment. I cannot wait for the third book to arrive. I was not disappointed with Kelley's storytelling or her characters in this book. She added new depths and new delights with every page. Certainly a page turner that will cause you to loose more than a few fingernails in nailbiting suspense. Well worth the read."}

{"text": "After two books of hit or misses, Neff really steps up to the plate with The Fiend and the Forge. At the end of the second book, I had made the comment that it was a shame so many people were comparing this to a knock-off of Harry Potter because Neff had talent but couldn't live up to the Harry Potter fame. Let me just say The Fiend and the Forge takes all the comparisons to Harry Potter and puts them to shame. \n Neff really upps the ante in this book and takes the whole series in a new direction. Sure there are similarities to Harry Potter but that happens in ALL fantasy books. I could make comparisions to Lord of the Rings or other high name books. But the thing that stands out is that Neff matures his main characters, and brings a darker side to the novels. He really takes things into his own hands and really improves the story. \n Over the course of three books Neff has not only matured his story and plot but he also has matured as a writer. There is a slight maturity as a writer that made me proud to say that I followed Neff when. Some fo the things that popped into my mind was the diversity in words and descriptions. In the first book I could swear everything was \"Pudgy\" \"doughy\" etc. Neff got away from this habit and was able to describe things without having to use comparisions to every day objects or over describe. \n While I did enjoy this novel there is still the habit of tossing in the completely unbelievable and totally unnessary parts of the plot. The biggest one that stuck out was the whole making Max a part of the staff. It served nothing to the plot, took away from the dark side of the book and just seemed out of place. However, these out of character plot elements were fewer and far between than previous books (think the whole element of allowing Max's dad to stay at shchool)."}
{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n Much to my delight, I received an advance copy of this novel from the publisher, St Martin's Press, via NetGalley.com. I tried hard not to reveal any important details but it's so hard to talk about this book without spilling beans. \n I first discovered Sarah Addison Allen by accident. The Girl Who Chased the Moon was a freebie on Amazon. It looked like an easy read and at the time, anything free was good for me, I grabbed it up and started reading... and I just couldn't stop. Magical, whimsical, light and delightful, my fingers just kept turning pages. I got to the end and I thought, \"Well that was nice.\" As is my habit when I find an author whose style I adore, I sought out her backlist and she quickly jumped onto my my AUTO ADD, MUST READ lists. \n I've read every novel that Ms Allen has published and I feel like each is better than the last. All of her books have the slightest bit of magic, a touch of drama, but mostly center around warm and inviting southern towns and delectable food. To read an Allen novel is to get lost in rustic, friendly North Carolina for about four hours. I look forward to the trip every year. \n One of the recurrent themes in Allen's books is friendship and family. We first met the Waverleys in Garden Spells, one of my favorite Allen novels (though I say that about all of them). Returning to Bascom, North Carolina and the sisters Claire and Sydney feel like having a sit d0wn with a couple of old friends-- catching up, meeting the new people in their lives. This story centers around Bay Waverley, Sydney's daughter, who is so much unlike her mother (and so much like her aunt Claire) that Sydney sometimes wonders if the child is really hers. After fleeing an abusive husband and returning to Bascom, Sydney married the love of her life, childhood friend Henry. He adopted Bay, and they're one big happy family, except for one thing. She wants to give Henry a son. \n Claire has always been self sufficient, the rock that other Waverly's hold onto. Her catering business has fallen by the wayside in favor of magical Waverly candies. There's a line that says something really profound, that Claire making candies is like like having the most perfect chair in the most perfect room, but the chair being covered in the wrong fabric-- it's such a small detail that no one really seems to notice. Except Claire. She's not completely happy, making candy all day and she worries about her daughter Moriah, who doesn't seem to display any signs of the Waverly trait. She doesn't have a gift. \n Lingering over the Waverly women is the distant memory of Lorelei, their wayward and wild mother who left them with their Grandmother Mary, never to be seen again. There's a legend that she ate an apple from the magical Waverly tree (Waverlyes don't ever eat the apples) and when you eat the apples from the tree, you see the biggest event in your life. Even if that event is your death. \n Despite the magic and the gifts, Claire has always questioned whether she was authentically a Waverley-- her business and her livelihood depend on her heritage. When a curious man is seen lurking about the house, appearing and disappearing at whim, he brings with him questions and suspicions about Lorelei and Claire. What if Claire wasn't Lorelei's child'? What if everything Claire has ever known about her life is a lie? What if she isn't really a Waverly? And what about the notebooks that Grandmother Mary hid around the house, the ones with the blacked out entries? Are there answers hidden in them? What does it all mean? \n Woven into this story of family relationships is a budding romance between Bay Waverley and a popular soccer player named Josh. It's heartwarming and cute to watch Bay in all her teenage awkwardness become close with a young man who knows more about himself than most young men do at his age. Bay's gift is knowing where people belong. Bay knows where she belongs... if only she can convince Josh of the same. \n I find myself longing for another installment of this magical family. The tree (and the house) has so much personality, it's probably my favorite character. And I feel like there is more story to tell. Like Evanelle... what did M mean by telling her not to be in such a hurry to go, there's more work to be done? Sydney's relationship with Victoria took a bit of a predictable turn, but I feel like there is more there? Josh and Bay-- do they end up together? Buster and Fred-- come on, isn't there a niggle of attraction? And Moriah, who finally displays a gift.. surely, Ms. Allen, there's another Waverley tale inside you!"}

{"text": "What I liked most about this novel was that it was NOT yet another tired re-worked supernatural romance. This is a realistic telling of a world which goes on daily, coping with its supernatural aspects just as with taxes and other inconveniences. We don't get -- or need -- a lengthy exposition of where the Other Stuff comes from or how humans should fear it; we just get a story that is fresh. \n We're left wanting more -- that's a good thing. Better to wonder what the \"different ways of being what we are\" might be than to beat it to death in minute detail and choke the reader. We don't know where the magic comes from, or how it works, or why Constantine is who he is, or any of a number of things -- but we know enough. We know that the story works, and we know that the story hasn't ended, as stories don't just \"end\" in real life. I liked that."}

{"text": "Also on http://thebooknatic.wordpress.com/ \n So, this is going to be my attempt at hiding the overwhelming details of my excitement of what I thought about the book movie adaptation, The Host. I am also going to do a slight book review to add to this, even though I read it years ago. I went to see this movie shortly after release but am just now having the time to actually sit down and really write my thoughts on it, calmly too might I add!... \n AHH!!!!!! -#%(*)UTJHyy- Okay. Done with the last of my happy-bursts. ((Sorry this review is long)) \n I took my mom out to see this movie, and I have to say, it was beyond outstanding! As I've said before, generally upon book-to-movie adaptations being released, I try my best to not set myself up for disappointment and walk into the show with low expectations, because I am just nerdy enough to get heartbroken over a lousy attempt at my favorite books being brought to life. The awesome thing about going in with low hopes is that feeling when that guard you spent so much time putting up prepping yourself for disappointment is shattered by the mind-blowing actuality of a splendid well put together outcome. \n I was so crazy about this book I read it more than once, and pretty much remembered line for line, and my favorite quotes, it was exhilarating to experience a successful adaptation such as this, my favorite scenes and quotes saved from the producing-butcher! \n For those of you who haven't read the book, it's set in a Dystopian age where an alien race has taken over Planet Earth and invades the human species. They are generally a kind, gentle species and create a new world without money, government, and wars. Though the actual act of invasion seems barbaric, the alien race really only acted with great intentions, not realizing what they are doing is actually wrong and forceful. Their sole purpose was to bond with a foreign species to bring harmony to a world of need. Humans in their eyes needed help, for we are the lesser, barbaric, and hateful race. Stephanie Meyer really hits it on the spot how messed up our society is with this novel. \n The souls are inserted into the human brain, and are then used to sift through the human's memories to gather any information on the last of the non-assimilated humans. Though, in some cases such as one of our Heroine's, Melanie, are stronger than our extraterrestrial invader expects and the human mind revolts and battles its trespasser to regain control over their body once again, though such incidents are rare. \n In this case, here we meet Wanderer. Gentle soul who later earns the nick name, Wanda, and has lived for millennia and has bonded with many hosts from many planets. Wanda is assigned to our strong protagonists, Melanie and when she feels the power and strength of Melanie's love as she sifts through her memories, she slowly begins to conform to the human emotion, overwhelmed with the power of love and understands enough to feel driven to help Melanie be reunited with her little brother and the man she loves. Wanda stops cooperating with the lead Seeker, and Melanie and Wanda embark on the electrifying journey, but a dangerous one at that, as The Seeker begins the hunt to destroy both Wanda and Melanie both. \n Again, you won't be getting any spoilers from me, but if you can enjoy a good Sci-Fi, though this could be classified as Young Adult, I feel this could be enjoyed by all ages. A little bit of romance, thriller, mystery, and a whole lot of Sci-Fi will be experienced! \n This movie, I can't stress enough, for those who have read the book but not yet watched the movie, please do yourself a favor, and see this one! It's rare I enthusiastically propose readers to experience a book adaptation for themselves, it was that perfect! The scenes from the book which made me cry, laugh and leave me on the edge of my seat, effectively had me doing so as the movie went on, right on que."}
{"text": "While I enjoyed Cruel Beauty more, this story was so meticulously crafted, it was impossible not to admire the great deal of detail and ingenuity that went into creating it. Every word and scene were vital to the plot and came full circle. Nothing was superfluous and the protagonist was very admirable. \n Great story, Ms Hodge."}
{"text": "I am very conflicted on giving this book 2 or 3 stars. I felt that Curely's writing grew with this book. However as this is the ending of a series I felt there were few characters that got the ending they needed. As a matter of fact the ending was lame. As a matter of fact if I knew this was the ending I would not have read the book."}

{"text": "Falling into the steam-punk literary genre, Boneshaker tells the story of an alternate 19th-century Seattle, one that falls victim to technology, resulting in a quarantined city infected with deadly gas and ruthless zombies. Briar Wilkes, the widow of the inventor of the machine that devastated the city, dares to traverse Seattle's ruins as she searches for her son, Zeke, who ventured into the quarantine to find out the truth about his father. \n Despite this interesting-enough premise, the writing quality falls short. Everything felt too contrived to me: the characters, the dialogue, the descriptions, the action. A book that could have been a delightful escapist novel I felt was resigned to shallow reading that didn't do much for me."}

But while the friends were all important, there wasn't enough of them together for me. Also, this is not the last in the series."}
{"text": "Quite an adventure. Deston, a teenage boy, has had a rough go, his mom disappeared and he ended up in the foster system. Then he gets told he's going to France to live with a relative, where he doesn't speak the language and doesn't know anyone, not even the relative. The only thing he is sure about is that his mom is alive, even though others are telling him she's not. He soon learns though that everything he thought and all that he thinks he knows isn't true. \n Deston soon enters a world of magic but where there is magic their are sinister things happening. He's trying to find his mother but someone not only wants his parents dead but him as well. As I read there was this steady feeling of something sinister hanging over the teenager, so you know something bad is going to happen, you're just not sure when. There are some well crafted evil characters. I have to say the setting was really well done. There was one point where he's riding a bike, which he ditches and goes into the forest, he's forbidden to enter and it was so clear to me, I could see it. There were several scenes that really came alive for me - the golden bridge that only Deston could step onto, only to cross and find a large wooden door blocking his way, the pyramid scene was pretty cool - can't share too much more. It has some really sad moments, some heartwarming moments, suspense, magic, adventure, mystery... It really was an intriguing read. And of course your rooting for this young teenager to come out on top as well. I was given a copy as part of a tour. I look forward to book 2. \n Reviewed on my blog: http://wp.me/p2ydBl-10F"}
{"text": "This book was a roller coaster: lots of highs and lots of lows for me. I enjoyed the assassin competition, Sal as a character, Maud was the best thing in this book, and the beginnings of this world and the history of it were interesting. But some of the world building had holes in it for me, which is the nature of a first fantasy book in a series. Also, the format was confusing and jumped around a bit. Finally, I struggled with Sal's journey as an assassin, going from having killed no one to having committed seven murders by the end of the book. It seemed too easy for them; there was a lot of rage but not empathy and their pain came from the past so it was hard to always comprehend. It was almost like rooting for a sociopath and I'm not gonna lie, that was hard to connect to. I am still unsure if I will continue the series; I am intrigued to see more of the world and how this revenge plot will continue but we'll see when we get there. \n Conclusion: Keep the ARC for now, possibly pass it on to a YA Fantasy lover"}

Trust me when I say, no ones was as surprised as I was when I found that I actually began to enjoyed the story. Yeah, there were many elements that I Didn't enjoy, but it wasn't that bad. I really liked the Dialogue in this book, especially between the 'Brothers', it was ..interesting to say the least. The characters were fairly well developed, strange , yet developed. The description was okay.The romance was meh. I really enjoyed the many persepectives used throughout the story. \n However I didn't really appreciate reading a whole glossary of words in order to understand the story. plus I'm not the biggest fan of the whole 'bonding' ( instalove) thing happing with these ' drop dead Gorgeous vampires' - overused ... \n still many unanswered questions, but that was to be expected considering the number of books within the series... \n overall it was a decent book."}

{"text": "I am really struggling to articulate or even understand my feelings for this book. When it comes down to it, I think the best way to express how I feel is to say I appreciated the story rather than loved it. \n I found it difficult to feel fully engaged in Joe's story. To be perfectly honest, I think the fantasy element dampened my enthusiasm. I don't read a lot of this genre, and Joe's journey, filled with mythical creatures and other wonders, just didn't do it for me. To the extent that I actually struggled to read the first half of the book. \n The concept of the afterlife was fascinating and I appreciated the journey, the descriptions, the imagination. \n What was interesting was my surprise to find myself a bit teary near the end of the story. Somehow, along the journey, I had found myself emotionally invested in the outcome. \n This is the type of book that is thought provoking and definitely very unique. While I struggle to say I loved it, and in all honesty found the first half hard going, it was a book I am glad I completed. Would I recommend it? According to other people's reviews and it's overall rating, yes, but from a personal perspective, maybe not.

{"text": "This is a contemporary paranormal romance that features M/M, F/F and M/F scenes. \n McKay is on a mission to visit Scotland to honor his grandfather's dying wish. He takes with him a talisman, a carved stone that his grandfather brought back from Scotland when he emigrated to Canada. \n McKay is an attractive human--a model, in fact--but he's freshly aware that humans are not the only beings on Earth. His last serious boyfriend was a Canadian werewolf. On this flight of fancy, McKay meets new friends who end up bringing him to a fest in the highlands. This fest happens to occur in a remote stronghold of Fae magic, where the Lord and Lady of the land still bear the magic of the Fae. \n The Lord of this manner, Niall, favors men, and had recently taken up with an Irish Pooka--or shapeshifter. Their liaison is rocky, on account of Pookas being notorious thieves. Meeting McKay, Niall is pretty taken with the sexy foreigner. \n The fest is a celebration of harvest-time, and Niall's lands have struggled for two generations. It seems the key to their restoration lies with the McKay's talisman and the Pooka's magic. \n In truth, I struggled a bit with the voice of this book. The first part was especially difficult for me, with dialogue and description that read awkwardly, and had TMI. It read like the story was being told at me, not me experiencing it, due to the info-dump background. This style wasn't my fave, and I might have stopped reading if the book wasn't so short. The plot complications worked out in a convenient manner, perhaps too convenient. Still, as I got closer to the end, I seemed to enjoy the story more. \n I received a copy of this book via NetGalley."}

{"text": "Warring Angels & Demons with a human caught in the middle \n This story has a bit of a Dan Brown flavor to it, with two supernatural races fighting it out, and a young woman on a quest for three hallowed weapons that could save humanity. The author puts the hero and heroine in direct conflict for all the right reasons so while the plot is solved for each novel, the romanic arc is still at risk presumably until the last story in the trilogy."}
{"text": "In order to truly rate this book, you need to separate yourself and put yourself into the shoes of the target audience. An adult looking at this novel will probably think it is just a Harry Potter knock-off with a bit of Hunger Games thrown in. And in many ways that is true, but it is much more than that. \n I see the Unwanteds as a a stepping stone for children readers into more complex worlds and other genres. It has a dystopian theme that isn't found in Harry Potter, but it has a flow to it that makes it a quick read and one that is easily understandable. \n There are (from an adult standpoint) a few plot points that seem to be unexplained or overlooked for their extreme nature, but overall this is a really good book. The characters are a bit three dimensional, the magic system is fun, and there are complex-ish 'bad guys'. There is also a whole grey area on right/wrong and good/bad. \n Some of the things that knocked this down from a 5 star to a 4 star are: \n Time movement - the book spans an entire year in 390 pages. It just seemed like it moved so fast and things could have slowed down just a little bit. I didn't even realize it had been a whole year until characters would say stuff like \"You have been here a year. Do you feel different\". \n The Mage - I got a bit frustrated with his hands-off approach when he knew that people's lives were at stake. He wanted to save people, but a character's free-will and ability to make mistakes was more important than saving other people's lives and preventing a huge disaster. \n Romance - Alex is starting to develop feelings for a character in the story. It happened suddenly and out of nowhere. I would have liked to see more character building and save the romance for later books. \n Even with this issues. I enjoyed the book. It isn't something I would read right after Harry Potter, as to me HP is extremely good. But if you let some time pass and are willing to go in with an open mind, it is a really good book."}

{"text": "My review on thinking for a while is different from the review that I would leave right after reading the book.

I was entertained though!"}
{"text": "See full review for Hereafter at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n I like coming across strange and different books. Hereafter is definitely one of those. When this book begins we are transported to Amelia having a nightmare about drowning. Only this nightmare that Amelia had actually happened. She died drowning. And when she wakes up from that dream, she's back in the river that she drowned in over by High Bridge Road. This time, though, it's different because there is someone else in there with her. \n Like I said before I like coming across strange and different books. This book definitely had the different and strange thing going for it. The concept of having a ghost being the main narrator was totally different for me and I thought for sure that I had actually picked up a book from The Mediator series by mistake. Amelia, as cool as being a ghost was, was still pretty annoying and there were a few times where I just hoped that Eli would succeed and take her away only so that I didn't have to deal with her anymore."}

{"text": "4.5 stars. I decided to reread this one since I loved it as a preteen. Found it just as captivating, though much more sexist."}
{"text": "Gosh, \"Become\" is such a hard book to describe. It was a book I loved to hate. \n Allow me to explain. It gripped me from the first page. I read it in a day, I was very captivated by it, and really wanted to see what happened. In that sense, I loved it. \n Much of the book takes place in Desi's head. On one hand, I have to say that Desi's voice was strong, and well developed. On the other hand, her head is a wild place to be. She is very repetitive, thinks the same things a lot - \"I was the devil's daughter...\" Yup got it. Don't need to hear it thought over and over. \n She frequently feels the need to justify her behavior and thoughts and feelings by reminding us just who she is. And that was where my hate came in. By halfway in, I knew the character pretty well, I didn't need all the constant extra explaining. \n The pace was fantastic. It moved fast and never got dull or boring. \n The editing was clean. A few small formatting issues - extra spaces. But absolutely nothing that interfered with readability. \n This book, all in all, is an example of a self published title well done. The cover is breathtaking, and the interior design is done very well too. \n But then we come to the end. I don't mind cliffhangers - to some extent. This one though, left me feeling very unsatisfied. I fully expect the first book in a series to leave me with questions and wanting more. This though, left me feeling like \"what was the point?\" \n From one standpoint, I can see that the conclusion was more in her emotional journey, and that part was at least a bit satisfying. \n I really believe that a cliffhanger, done well, should at least leave a character and by proxy the reader, on a high note. - This book failed to deliver that. \n If it weren't for the ending, I would have likely given 4 stars, even if the repeated thoughts did get a bit annoying, so you may like this book better than I did if cliffhangers don't bother you. \n I haven't made up my mind yet if I will get the sequel. It's my understanding that as of right now, the 3rd book isn't out yet, and I suspect the second book will be just as much of a cliffhanger from the reviews I have read on it. I will probably wait until the author concludes the series, and then consider finishing it."}
{"text": "If you like The Daughter of Smoke and Bone, you will probably like Shadow and Bone. They are both such creative YA novels and the worlds they are in are so phenomenal! They take fantasy to a neat level yet they both do a good job of having real, likable and realistic characters. I'm very excited to see what happens with this series. I hate that I can't find the audiobook versions at the library since the reader was great and would like to listen to the rest of the series."}
{"text": "I liked this book. It did remind me of a few other books. Harry Potter: because the main character, Diana, is like Harry in that she has crazy amounts of power unlike anyone else and she doesn't realize the extent of her powers. Twilight: because well, I can't read a book about a vampire and NOT think of Twilight. And, at the end it reminds me of Outlander because of the time jumping, even though we don't get that far in this book. I'm looking forward to reading the next one."}
{"text": "So...the wee one brought this book home from the library and we have spent our break reading it together. I enjoy Geronimo's attitude and the plays on words. I also enjoy the very visual colorful pages. It keeps the wee one engaged. And while I understand this book was not written for me, I do wish it was a bit less predicable. \n Read it again! Little dude thinks this is THE boom for the two of us. Oh well! I guess it could be worse!"}
{"text": "I would put this in the hands of my middle-school students, but I don't think I'd recommend it to my fellow lit teachers. It's fun, slightly simplistic, with a truly plucky* heroine and includes intriguing connections to Transylvania as a real place, not as a monster haven. \n *\"Plucky\" is such a cliched word, but Reveka embodies its meaning - and a little of its cliche."}
{"text": "Ihan mahtava kirja! Juoni onnistuu edelleenkin olemaan erikoinen ja silti karttamaan suurimmat kliseet.

Vaikka sain kirjan loppuun keskella yota, oli pakko hakea hyllysta seuraava osa (jonka olin fiksusti lainannut kirjastosta etukateen) ja aloittaa se samantien... Ei tata sarjaa turhaan ole kehuttu!"}
{"text": "Cold Fire like Cold Magic had a bit of a rocky start. For the first 100 or so pages things were tough to follow. Conversations, events, and text just seemed to be thrown out there with no real rhyme or reason. \n After that rocky start I was worried how the rest of the book would come about but it came out perfectly. Elliott gets her footing at about 150 pages and it's a rip, roaring ride from there till the last page. \n There are a few things that I didn't like - \n 1. The whole making islanders talk oddly. I understand the reason for it but it just seemed hard to read and pointless to make the islanders say \"ye\" \"yo\" and such. \n 2. Cat is this fairly strong main character. What I don't understand is the whole \"do it or you'll be made into a salter\". Okay, so she does it once, I get that but to continue to do it. I thought she was much stronger than that. It seemed this whole book was a rush to shed hers and Bea's virginity and it just didn't fit with Cat. Again, this is totally personal but I just didn't see it and it seemed out of character. \n While these things I didn't like, I did love the book. I stayed up late to finish it and just fell in love with Cat all over again. I hope the third book starts off a little easier than the first two did as that is really my only complaint."}

{"text": "3.5 stars. I've recently watched some of The Returned (or 'Les Revenants' as it's actually French subtitled), a channel 4 show in the UK based on the premise of the dead returning to life. Although this show isn't based on this book the themes somewhat the same - specifically for this story, Harold and Lucille's son Jacob who drowned in the 60's has mysteriously returned with no recollection of what has happened. This phenomenon is occurring all over the world, though the book isn't focused on this and you rarely have much of an insight into what else has happened beyond the central characters. \n No one really seems all that concerned about all the dead returning (or what happened to all the bodies they buried?!) nor are definite answers given. If you want closure and some at least far fetched scientific explanation, this isn't the book for you. Instead, the focus is on emotions and feelings mainly within this small town, dealing with the consequences and the government, and the repercussions of having these people back. \n This is a very slow paced book, but I think deliberately so as it's very thought provoking and such a fascinating concept. It also allows the tension and unease many feel with the Returned to be really felt by the reader. It definitely makes you think about your own life, and what you would say to those you could speak with again, or what you could 'change' about the past - or even what you would do or say if you were one of the Returned. \n I received a copy of this book for free via Goodreads First Reads - thank you!"}

He's my favourite character by far, and just the way he's developed and the more you learn about him... ugh. \n (I'M ROOTING FOR THIS ROMANCE AND I SHALL NEVER STOP, but I love the fact it's been 2 books and is still slowly developing; its so different than so many other books coming out lately) \n But seriously..

{"text": "Mirrorscape is a novel that is purely developed with a lot of thought and creativity going into the plotline. \n I really loved the idea of jumping into paintings and having a whole world beyond the real world where the artists creativity really rules. \n But there was something off about this novel. There were huge sections were tons of information was thrown at me and I felt almost overwhelmed. \n Another issue I had is that while I understand it's an imaginary world, everything just seemed so easy. The kids are in a problem BOOM this mystery person pops up and helps, they run out of stuff, BOOM a bad is found. It just seemed.... unrealistic and just way to darn easy. \n Don't get me wrong I loved the novel, but everything just seemed too smooth and easy for these children. I'll gladly read the second novel but really the easy problem I hope should be solved."}

{"text": "Mesa becomes pack Alpha,but isn't complete without the mate that left him years ago,so the first order of business becomes finding and returning his mate where he belongs-home with the pack. Life however has no intention of making his mission an easy one and finding Kody means finding the other part of himself as well. Kody was compelled to leave his mate because he knew that things would never be totally square between them as they were,so he followed his heart and found Samantha. When Mesa shows up on their doorstep an already emotional storm becomes a chaotic cluster as they sort through things never experienced by some and only partially understood by the others. \n When Samantha finds Kody in a compromising situation,her already stressed emotions boil over into an inferno of conflicting feelings- for as much as she feel betrayed by Kody she's even more betrayed by her response to the big,growly man who seems to think he can control her. \n B.A. Tortuga writes a complicated \"tail\" where the male doesn't get it all his way with the female falling at his feet in adoration, and I like that. The characters were fun as well as strong, pulled you into the story and let you enjoy their rather frenetic journey to finding their way to becoming what they're meant to be. Oh, yeah-the sex is quite as frenetic, stimulating and imaginative as any you could hope for; very vivid word painter is this author. Bravo."}
{"text": "I was both excited and terrified to read this book, both wanting to meet beloved characters again (pardon the pun) and fearful of what new suffering they might endure. Let me warn you now: don't let this book lead you into a false sense of security. It might seem as if Robin Hobb has gone soft, as if the horrific suffering of the previous books is over. She hits you with it when you least expect it. I did end up shouting and crying at the book, just as I did in the Tawny Man trilogy. Having said that, I also adored this book. I love the new character of Bee. I love the setting of Withywoods. I love the fact that I kept spotting the significance of details from the cover art as they occurred in the plot. So there is lots to love here, and lots to agonise over, too. And, yes, you will still be shouting at Fitz for being dense and creating problems for his nearest and dearest with his bad decisions. It's just a shame that a book takes so long to create and so little time to read. What happens next?!?"}
{"text": "3.5. Review to come closer to publication."}
{"text": "I actually liked a YA novel! Well... it was by my favorite author, so I guess it doesn't really count. Kadrey nails the perspective, thoughts, and personality of a 15 year old girl, (which is difficult, even for women who were once 15 year old girls) but still keeps the grit and casual snark that makes Sandman Slim so appealing. Dead Set takes you into the angsty, longing, and lonely world of Zoe, who having just lost her father and moved to a new city with her struggling mother, is searching for somewhere to belong, and someone to get close to again. She finds hope in an odd place, an old record store, and for a girl raised on classic punk music, it seems the perfect place to get her closure with her late rockstar father. But that of course only leads to trouble. She finds herself in a new world halfway between life and death, and she's never sure in which world she wants to stay. Read it! You'll love it, I promise!"}

{"text": "Actual Rating \n : 3.8 \n I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's semi fast-paced, but definitely an easy read. I love reading from Rose's POV, as she is a kickass female protagonist and the close bond between her and Lissa is really refreshing and definitely makes me want a friendship like theirs. This book was definitely a great start to the series and I really want to go out and see the movie adaptation for it already! As always, there is a good deal of world building and character set-up since it's the first book, but there were still definitely some \"Oh sh*t\" moments. I've been put off on whole vampire-themed YA books since the whole Twilight fandom kicked off (as did the parodies and such)and was ruined for me, but this book was pretty unique. I really like how there's two classe of vampires and the fact that some can wield elemental magic. The vampire aspect isn't so typical and I'm just a sucker for books set in boarding schools. All in all, I can't wait to see what the rest of the series has in store for me. \n SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT: \n I totally knew I couldn't trust Natalie. Pfffffft."}

{"text": "Still running down some fave paranormal/Urban Fantasy reads for the October SPOOKTACULAR. \n FIRST GRAVE ON THE RIGHT by Darynda Jones is a gem! \n Charley Davidson is a Reaper. She doesn't actually harvest souls--she's merely a portal--a conduit to the otherside. A Pearly Gate, if you will. \n And, she's been this way her whole life. Even brought her own mother's soul to eternal rest when she died at Charley's birth. \n So, it's no surprise when dead lawyers show up unwilling to ride the express to Eternity. What is shocking? The three of them are partners--and they had a really nasty client. \n Can anyone say m-o-b h-i-t? \n Being the gate to the afterlife doesn't pay bills. Charley works as a PI, and also helps her uncle, a police detective, solve crimes for the Albuquerque PD. Why not? I mean, lots of murder victims could tell her exactly where to find the body and who the perp was. \n Anywho...Charley's seen it all. Except perhaps for the dream lover who continues to sex-her-up when her eyes close. He's the absolute sex bomb. And, for good reason: Reyes Farrow is the son of Satan. Yeah. \n Uber-hot! \n Oh! I see you staring down your nose at me! Who's to say he's pure evil? And, and, even if he is, lots of girls go for the Bad Guy, amiright? \n Besides, he's just a dream lover...which means they do the dirty dance in her head. No need for confession, folks. \n Charley endeavors to solve the mystery of the Three Dead Lawyers whilst dodging a pint-sized poltergeist and commiserating with her BFF/secretary Cookie and lamenting her shitty coffee maker. It's a rollicking time--and Charley manages to get herself beat up (twice?) and nearly shot by a client's abusive husband. In this she would have died but a cloaked visage appears and slices her attacker down with mystical efficiency. \n Here's the thing: this book is Laugh. Out. Loud. Charley is irreverent. She's so dead pan (pun intended) about her interactions with the departed that it stuns the reader into hilarity. In the end she does help the lawyers to crossover and finds out a bit more about the connection between Dreamy Reyes and the cloaked assassin. Oh, and it's hawt. \n FIRST GRAVE is the first in a series--and I've read on. They are soooo fun."}

Guinevere discovers she inherits her mother's Druid powers. She's brave, independent, stubborn but all around lovable. \n This is a true Romantic Adventure, and I cannot wait to read what's left in the series!"}

{"text": "3.5 - 4 stars \n Am I off the angst rollercoaster yet? \n While I'm super happy that Qhuinn and Blay got their HEA, I didn't think there was enough of them throughout the book. I usually am okay with the multi-subplots the WARDen got going on, but in this case, it was TOO distracting. Some weren't that important to garner THAT much page time, especially when it could've been focused on Qhuay! \n Qhuinn/Blay: I'm really proud of Qhuinn and how far he has come in becoming the male he is now. Sure it took him a little bit long but all that headf*ck and neglect from his family had some major impact on his ability to accept who he is and who he can be. Not only is he learning to be a better person, he's also becoming a vital asset to the Brotherhood with his skills. Qhuinn wasn't the only person to grow though, Blay has changed as well. No longer does he wear his heart on his sleeves when it comes to Qhuinn. As much as he tries to fight his feelings, \"the heart wants what the heart wants.\" When these two came together (er, no pun intended), it was HOTTTT. I don't read M/M much so there's not much expectations in that area. But dayum. \n Layla/Xcor: I'm starting to like her more and more. As for Xcor, his character has gotten soft. Maybe it's the Chosen's doing but I'm not sure how Ward is going to pair these two up, especially with all that's going on. \n Trez/Selena: I thought these two met before? But anyway, I hope the Shadows get their own books! \n Assail/Sola: I like Assail...helloooo alpha male instincts. Sola was okay. We'll see what happens with them. \n So many pairings now... I really want the books to go back and focus on ONE couple 'kay? \n Saxton: Now here's someone with true class. I really like his character so I hope he gets his HEA too. \n Luchas: Totally didn't see that one coming. \n The lessers: seem irrelevant in this story. I skimmed any parts with them, unless the Brothers were involved. \n Lassiter: My favorite funny man. I need his book! \n Some other thoughts: \n Who was on the phone with Xcor at the end?!?!! \n Where the heck was John Matthew in all this?? This book is about his two best friends, yet he barely had any presence in the book. I would have loved to get his POV on the whole Qhuay thing. \n The major saving grace for me was the epilogue. I could read that over and over and over again. There was more romance in that epilogue than through the whole book. I needed more sappy heart melting moments in the beginning! I better see an actual mating ceremony between Qhuinn and Blay or I'm going to be VERY disappointed. \n I can't wait for The King.

In this book we get to see many new burgeoning relationships, and understand the inner workings of this select group of law enforcement agents. \n Potential couples to be eyeing: naturally Calvin and his tiger Therian partner, Hobbs. (I KNOW! The jokes are merciless, seriously.) But, there's also some really, really touchy-feely things happening between Ash--who is straight--and Dex's step-brother Cael, the sweet and tender cheetah Therian. All of this will likely bear fruit down the pike, but I can't help wonder who'll do the chasing... \n As for the plot, the THIRDS teams are being led on a merry chase for the terrorist organization, Order of Andrasteia, who longs to see Therians extreme acted, if possible. Hunting down the leader is, well, daunting. He is a former Human Police a force detective, and doesn't make a whole lotta planning errors. In fact, this dude's set on hurting Sloane most heinously--by ripping Dex away, and letting Sloane suffer the grief of losing another lover. \n In the meantime, relationships are getting complicated. Dex only wants Sloane, but can he continue with everything on the down-low? What about when Dex's ex-boyfriend stumbles onto the scene? And how can Sloane keep Dex to himself when his own Delta team--even the lesbians--would pick the suave and quirky Dex for a one-nighter in Marry, F@ck, Kill? (Poor Ash, he really got nailed in that little game!) \n The tension is super high throughout. Sloane has lots of secrets about his recruitment to THIRDS that he wants to remain secret, but the Order seems hell-bent on revealing all it can to discredit THIRDS and the Therians, in general. There are some great tender moments, and some that are plain-out hot. While this is a continuing series, there is a complete resolution to the main plot arc. Still you kinda gotta read the series in order. Not that I'm complaining. I'm a Dex-Girl; I gotta see this one through."}

{"text": "The Student Prince has got to be the best fanfic of Merlin out there. It is the best. 100+ stars all the way. My inner fangirl is jumping for joy. \n Merlin has always been one of my favourite T.V shows and I love reading fanfiction about it. Especially fanfiction with the pairing, Merlin and Arthur. I've always thought they were perfect together and it came as a real frustration not to get what I want. So when The Student Prince, which I first read on the fanfiction site, 'Archive of our Own', by Fayjay, was published as an actual novel, it was a wonderful surprise and for lots of reasons. \n It had all the perfect blend of angst, romance, magic, action and humour. The dialogue was funny and made me laugh more than several times throughout the story. The scenes, especially the one with the Raisin Weekend and meeting Morgana, were just bloody hilarious. The characters were a bonus point- I loved every single character and that's something books can rarely get out of me. \n Merlin was an adorable,cute protagonist with a secret-specifically magic. I loved his interactions with everybody. Arthur was a jerk in the beginning, but he was one of those \"nice, oblivious jerks.\" Morgana, I love her, is amazing. She doesn't share much with the character from the T.V show, but I liked it that way. The one thing I especially loved that the author accomplished, was giving each character some sort of depth even if they were minor. \n This is a must-read, a have-to-read, a just-read-it and many more. People are missing out if they haven't."}
{"text": "As a big fan of Jane Austen and a big fan of fantasy, I was enchanted by this book and never wanted it to end. When thinking of other works to compare it to, the closest I can come is Sorcery and Cecelia, which I read several years ago and also loved. What I found most amazing about this work is the way that Clarke was able to so closely match the early 19th-century novels she is copying, both in word choice (right down to the spelling!) and in tone. If you've read a lot of those novels, as I have, it's easy to believe that you've stumbled across a missing work from that time period. But if you haven't read that kind of novel very much (or at all), I'm afraid a lot of the charms of this work will be lost on you. I think that's why, in the reviews I've found of this work here and at other places online, literary scholars tend to love it and fantasy fans tend to be puzzled by it."}

{"text": "Modern Magic is a collection of four novellas that purport to be updates of classic fairy tales. Three of them do that with varying degrees of success. \"A Late Blooming Rose\" is a Beauty and the Beast tale in which the beast is a young woman confined to a wheelchair. \"Music to Her Ears\" takes on Goldilocks in a too-short story about a personal assistant hired to work for three musician brothers. \"Fairy Trouble\" is an interesting spin on Cinderella in which the fairy godmother is the one who goes to the ball. And I don't know what \"His One Wish\" was trying to be. Perhaps Aladdin since there was a computer program called Genie and a villain named Jin. But the last story didn't feel like a fairy tale at all - too many gun battles, too much blood and too much sex. Since I was in the mood for something a little more fantastical, \"His One Wish\" kind of spoiled the rest of the book for me and dragged down my overall rating."}

{"text": "See full review for Proposal at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n Susannah Simon is in the cemetery on Valentine's Day. This should be an odd place for her to be if it wasn't for two things. One, that her and her uber hot, doctor boyfriend don't really celebrate the holiday because it is just overdone. Two, she's a mediator and she's doing what she does best. Mediate. There is a new spirit that has been making some waves lately in the cemetery, flowers that have been placed on his dead girlfriend's grace have been winding up being kicked and scattered throughout the grounds. Normally, this wouldn't be cause for alarm, but the parents put up a camera and the antics - fuzzy as they may be - have gone viral. So Suze is spending Valentine's Day in the cemetery to put this ghost to rest and make him realize that he shouldn't be mad just because he ended up killing his girlfriend in a fit of jealous rage when she said no to his proposal. Except...that's not what happened at all and now she has to figure out the truth before the ghost winds up murdering someone else. \n I was so excited to read this novella because as I've been mentioning in my previous reviews for this series, I know the other books backwards and forwards and I really wanted to know what happened to Suze next. Especially five years after the events of Twilight. She's an adult, in college, and her boyfriend is actually alive. Things should have been great, right? Well...not really."}

{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n This is an imaginative explanation for why the Queen of Hearts from Alice in Wonderland is the way that she is. I really liked the first 3/4 of the book. I just like happy endings, so it was a bit disappointing. Plus, Jest's death scene didn't seem to have enough impact as I would have wished. It seemed much more like a side note to what was going on at the time. It could be because I liked his character so much, but I think he deserved more."}
{"text": "The second book in the \"Circle of Magic\" quartet picks up about ten days after the first one ends. Viewpoint still shifts every few pages, but this book focuses on Trisana Chandler, who, before she came to Winding Circle Temple, was the daughter of merchants, but was passed from relative to relative because no one recognised her magic, and everyone thought she was just crazy. She has begun to make a home and friends for herself, but she's still the grouchiest of the four. Her power is primarily in weather magic, and she can hear distant conversations on the winds. \n The main action of the book involves the four friends defending their new home against a pirate attack. I was worried that this book was going to suffer from Harry Potter's malady of never telling an adult when he sees something odd or suspicious going on, but fortunately these kids are smart enough to speak up right away. Also surprising is these kids' willingness to inflict damage and kill to defend their home. \n The primary message of this book is the same as that of the previous one: That together the four friends are stronger than the sum of their individual magics. Good for ages 8+, but with some minor adult concepts which might require explanation."}
{"text": "DISCLAIMER: I received Emilie and the Hollow World as a publisher ARC through Strange Chemistry in exchange for my honest review. \n This review can also be found at The Title Page \n My rating: 3.5 Stars \n Emilie and the Hollow World was a great read. I don't regret one second spent reading this book. It didn't take me long to read at all because it kept me interested every page. \n The book starts out with a bang, we follow Emilie as she steals aboard the Merry Bell as she is running away from her uncle and aunt. She boards the ship by mistake, originally intending to stow away on another vessel. We are quickly engulfed in magic and transported, along with the crew, to a world-within-a-world like destination. \n The novel reads as an adventure. The cast of the book is met with one challenge at a time as they stride to their eventual goal. It is a really good read that is worth the time you will put into it, but it did fall short in that I wasn't blown away by it. It wasn't a book that I just couldn't put down, but at the same time, I never didn't want to pick it up again. \n If I had to describe this book in one word, it would be relatable. This book is easy to understand with a heroine you can really imagine in yourself. Emilie is strong-willed, but not pushy. She understands the extent of her knowledge and is willing to sit back and learn rather than insert herself into an issue. \n There are deeper issues that are addressed in the book, in the Victorian world that it takes place, sexism is a common theme. The protagonists combat that in the best way possible. Two of the main characters, Emilie and Lady Marlende, are women. The way the author approaches this is very professional, the women aren't looked down upon, but are given less opportunity to advancement. While Emilie seems to have accepted her place in the world, Lady Marlende is a tough cookie who doesn't take that crap. She stands her ground and Emilie soon follows. Lady Marlende is definitely a winning character, she wins my favorite vote. \n Sadly, the world building is where the novel suffered a bit, it could have used more depth. While reading the book, I didn't feel like I was transported to another world, which is normally my favorite part of alter-reality novels. While the world was creative enough, not enough description is given about the setting. We aren't told wether a place is supposed to be dark or light, forboding or inviting, etc. Things are explained in character conversation instead of the context of the book, and in that way it took away from the magic of the novel. I felt like I was reading a diary or memoir instead of a fiction novel. \n To conclude my review, I suggest this book for the adventurous types, who don't like to waste time on romance. It is a quick, fun, read that you won't feel you've wasted time on."}
{"text": "I really wanted to like Miss Mabel's School for Girls. It had everything I could ask for in a YA book - boarding schools, witches, evil a foot, but this book just did not do it for me. This book as a specific audience and it just is not me. \n First impressions are everything when it comes to your book. So I have to wonder what possessed the author to make the first introduction to Bianca so boring. It is literally an interview scene with Bianca going through the motions of hosting a tea party. I knew everything about hosting the tea party and very little about anything else - the school, the interview, what was going on. \n Unfortunately, the rest of the book panned out in similar ways. There wasn't much that happened that was unexpected, which made it disappointing. Everything panned out exactly as how you should have guessed. And the characters were one-dimensional and predictable. \n I will say I wish this book had a good editor. I struggled with the word choices and editing. Sentences were confusing and sometimes I'd have to read things two, three, or four times to understand what they were talking about. Sometimes it was because of the poor word choice, sometimes it was because there was a tense change and it confused me. \n I do think this novel deserves a shot because there is an audience for this book, it just isn't me."}

{"text": "First of all, Im in love with these books since I was 12 years old, and I got my first book for Christmas. I was hooked then, and I am still now, several years, books, movies and theme parks later. Once piece of me will always dream about this magical world, and Hogwarts will always be my home. \n Having said that, this is my favorite book of the saga. I just love how the plot gets darker and more serious, as Harry and his friends get older. He gets to know more about his parents and this army that fought and still fights against Voldemort, and now he is part of it. \n The only thing I didn't like is this whole dreams thing. This connection he shares with Voldemort is taken way too lightly, because even if he is learning to close his mind, Dumbledore should have realize it was going to be used against them, and do more about it. At least tell Harry that not everything he see was always going to be the true, and that Voldi could make use of it. So when the final fight starts I was kind of disappointed in Harry as well. And I cried and cursed Rowling. But again, who wouldn't?"}

More problems with family and nasty, nasty villains; and the alligators, Alliflash and Gigantagator, were imaginative and thrilling additions. \n Highly recommended--again--and I've already ordered #4.

{"text": "I skimmed my way to the end of this book to see if there was something in this story that would save it for me, and it's never a good thing when I find myself skimming. It means I've really became disinterested in the story, and that's exactly what happened in Paternus. The parts with Fi and Zeke were at least interesting, but I ended up not caring about much of anything else in this story. That surprised me because the premise is great with the Firstborn and the old gods coming back. It's not a terribly original premise, but if it's done well, it's one that I enjoy reading. As a mythology nut, I really like to see authors and stories that put their own twist on old myths. Paternus lacks no ambition in reinventing myths, and it's the main draw of ths story, but for all its pretense at originality, Paternus lacked substance in its world building. The big twists are obvious and take way too long to get to, and there's very little emotional reason for wanting to reach those twists, which is the main problem of the story. Simple plots are great when the story provides something else unique (characters usually and voice always) to draw me towards the conclusion. That never really materialized in Paternus like I thought it would. All of the characters are pretty dry, honestly, and this story probably suffered from being too ambitious with its world building and maybe not ambitious enough with it. I kind of connected with both Fi and Zeke and got their characters, and I found myself skipping other parts of the book just to read their chapters, and as the story went on, it became more and more about them, so it's worth finishing to keep up with their arcs. That said, these were some of the driest and least authentic characters I've encountered in fantasy, and it probably has a lot to do with the writing style. There's a lot going on in Paternus, and some of it is good, but a lot of it is...well, dry. Boring. Everyone says a lot but no one does a lot, and even when they do things, it's all For The Plot. So much failed to feal authentic, and when the story got better towards the end, I unfortunately didn't care enough and wasn't invested in it by those parts. All the parts with the Firstborn were a huge let down for me. It's a lot of 'and this god is like this and this god does this' and it's so much talking and so very little story telling."}

{"text": "(this is wholly opinion and won't tell you ANYTHING about the plot, really, only my reaction to it) \n Literally, and very truly, I may cry because this book is over and I have to wait until next year to read more by Rae Carson. Don't get me wrong, this book is complete on its own; there's no cliffhanger which has left me bereft. However, it's been a long time since I wholly fell in love with an author, her characters, her writing style. The three Carson pieces I've read have all earned five stars for me. \n Also, my opinion is that it's difficult to write effectively in present tense - and, yep! Carson writes skillful present tense."}

{"text": "A lot of people seem to dislike this book, I don't understand why though. It was surprisingly a well written book. I frankly, L O V E D it!! Our main character, Miranda, started off as a spoiled little brat and I will admit that bugged me a little. But lets face it, they're 4 books in this series and I knew that Cara Lockwod would make her \"change\" into a young heroine that all main characters end up changing into. I still felt bad for her though. I felt strong hatred towards her family because they were so blind and unfair. You see, Miranda's little sister, Lindsey is your stereotypical bratty little annoying nuisance. She blames EVERYTHING on Miranda! You would think a little sister would be sad to see her big sister shipped off to a school far away, but Lindsey? Nope. All she can think of is stealing Miranda's shoes from her closet. Thats just the sister though, the mother, yes she cares, but not enough give her the #1 Mother of the Year award. Lockwood makes the mother come out as some Botox addict. Now for the father, at first I hated him more than anything. He was so unfair and no words could express how badly I felt for Miranda. He is the 100% reason she is being shipped off to Bard Academy. Not her sister, not her mother, her FATHER and Miranda thinks it's just to get rid of her. \n Now, IN Bard Academy, all the teachers go by the first initial of their last name, to keep some privacy. In this book we have the three teachers that will be important, Headmaster B, Ms. W and Coach H. Just like the summary says, the teachers are dead writers who committed suicide or at least died before they were supposed to. If you know books like Dracula, Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre then you will most likely understand the book better than most. If you don't, Lockwood takes time to explain the book and its connection to the story so don't worry. One thing in this book that I loved was the loyalty. Miranda and her friends are so loyal to each other and stick together no matter what. I will be honest with you guys, there were some parts were I found it a little boring and slow but then the action picks up again, so if you could handle one slow part then you're good :) \n This book was fantastic!!! I loved it so much! Definitely a must read!"}
{"text": "Fog Magic by Julia L. Sauer, (c)1943. 5+ Stars. A wonderful middle grade book featuring irresistable fog as a means for a girl to time travel! A tale of a Nova Scotia family and their girl who is about to turn twelve, this book explores magical realism and takes us with it as it bends time to give us a peek of the main character Greta's newfound world. Will reality and responsibility make her a different person when she grows up; will she forget? This book was so good it was a Newbery Honor recipient in 1944. This is truly a read-again book for its mesmerizing inner story which begs the question of whether we can ever hold on to some of the true magic of our dearest moments of childhood--real or imagined. Highly recommend!"}
{"text": "6th&up \n 3.5 stars \n Like Natalie's automata, this story requires a little bit of work and quite a bit of winding up, but once it gets going it is a wonder to behold. \n In the same vein as Something Wicked This Way Comes, Natalie's quiet little town- which lies at the crossroad of somewhere Missouri and nowhere special- is on the brink of monumental change as a Medicine Show comes into town and brings nothing good along with it. Powerful forces are at work, and Natalie has a vital role to play- and she must play it well or her family and the entire town might be lost. \n Readers who stick with the story will be rewarded- the climax, when things all start to tie together and the final battle begins, will leave them breathless and glad they stayed awhile in the little town of Arcane."}
{"text": "This was a terrific read/listen. The story was tight, tense, interesting, and Stephen Kingesque without being a rip-off. I very much liked the main characters and never questioned how they acted and reacted in such a bizarre situation, which is impressive. The narration by John Lee was excellent and exactly what narration should be. It only took about 6 hours to listen to, so I'm imagining that reading it outright would only take one good night. And it'd be worth it to stay up past your bedtime to get it finished."}
{"text": "The beginning of this book was a bit repetitious from previous installments, but once we get into a bit of action it is pure, thriving battles and information.

No cases have been offered for months. Her first case comes with promise, but will the payout be worth all the trouble? \n I have never felt so close to Kate losing everything like I did in this book. I was scared for a moment that there might not be a happy ending. Like all of the books in this series, Kate makes it through with her feet on the edge of a cliff."}
{"text": "This was the second book in Sophie Jordan's Firelight series, and it started really strong, with an opening scene where Jacinda is falling. The story was gripping; I wasn't bored and there were certain things Sophie did really well, like capturing the desperation one feels in being shunned and censored by an entire community. I liked the inner-struggle Jacinda had going between doing what she wanted verses what she thought was right and responsible. The development of Cassian was good in this one, though Tamara's development seemed a bit sparse. \n I guess I was hoping to like Tamara more, that her attitudes would change toward Jacinda in book II, or that she'd gain more insight, but for most of the book she was just a brat. The character I felt the most sympathy for was their mother, who was treated poorly but had given up, losing her ability to do anything to fight back. The bonding ceremony was cool, as were the powers of the different Draki. I liked the world building in this, and probably would have given it more stars had it not ended on such a cliff hanger."}
{"text": "On this review I'll apply K.I.S.S. (=keep it short and simple) because it was a book from my purchased tbr. \n I liked this book but didn't love it. You all know I'm a sucker for PRN/Fantasy reads and when I saw it was on sale on Amazon I just had to buy -almost everything that has Vamps in it intrigues me. \n But unfortunately this one didn't rock my world. Val was a bit weird, and def kind of slutty .I mean, I've nothing against females that express their sexual desires or love to have lots of sex but she was a bit over the top; especially as a virgin. I mean every lil comment her mind drifted to sex -even though the dude didn't make any move or gave her any signs. It was a bit strange. How she gave up her virginity was sooo lame and I felt bad for the young man she was together with -he had no idea for the reasons behind her attentions and after that, whoops, he got completely erased by the author. I know I know, it got explained why she had to leave everything behind but still -poor sucker, he was a love-sick puppy. \n The beginning of the book was a bit hard to follow; the flashbacks seemed too chunky and the jumps were too far apart. Val's relationship with Jack -if you can call it like that- was too complicated for my taste and didn't make any sense; sorry. I liked him but totally didn't get him. \n But oooh yeah, I liked Lucas A LOT!! I couldn't stop comparing him with Eric from True Blood. I loved everything about him; his whole attitude as 1600yr old Vamp, his dialogue, his action...just everything. \n The concept of the book was good but I think Val was the reason I didn't love it. It need a bit more clarity and plot development to make it smoother to read. Of course it could be, that I'm again too picky, but I've read lots of PRN books and for my taste it was too weak to give it anything higher than 3 stars. \n If I'd recommend it? Sure, because I know many would love it. In my case, I'm not quite sure if I'll read book 2."}

{"text": "I think I liked this book. I say 'think' because at times I wasn't really too sure. I spent most of it thinking things like 'what's going on?', 'what does that mean?', 'how does that fit in?'. I kept trying to work out what was going on and pre-empt the paranormal twists, instead of just relaxing into the story. That being said, sometimes it's good to read something that keeps you on your toes! \n The story jumps between POVs, sometimes for only a very short period of time and sometimes longer. There are little hints and clues of the bigger picture but never enough for me to fully understand how everything fit together. And the ending - what just happened? \n It's an interesting story with hints and glimpses of strange things without fully providing the back ground. It is quite unique in what is shown but perhaps not the book for someone who likes a full world building with a clear cut happy ending. \n I now publish all my m/m reviews on my blog so if you want to see all my m/m reviews in one place come visit at Because Two Men Are Better Than One!"}
{"text": "After The Disappointment of Lost, I was biased against Son of a Witch from page one. I tried my best to limit my bias, but as this grandiose story unfolded, the disappointed feeling returned again and again. \n I enjoyed the larger-than-life, sweeping feeling of the novel at times, but Liir's character was too whiney and confused. Most of his time is spent wandering around Oz, wondering what to do. This doesn't make for very compelling reading. The end of the book fell flat, I feel, because I was never really cared about him. \n Also, the sex and vocabulary throughout the novel felt gratuitous. Is MacGuire showing off? Is he trying to explain who Liir is through his sexual escapades? I just felt distracted by the vocabulary and sexual overtones. \n In the end, MacGuire's talent is setting up political situations in fantasy settings. I was disgusted at the tyrannical leaders in the Emerald City by the end of the novel, but frustrated that Liir didn't really accomplish much. Not enough payoff for the setup, in the end."}

{"text": "I've now had the pleasure of being able to read this book two times (Once originally about a year ago, and again to refresh before reading the sequel) and boy oh boy was it wonderful both times. A year after reading it, I remembered that I truly enjoyed it the first time and the basic premise of the plot but I found that I had completely forgot anything beyond those two things so this was an exciting opportunity to re-experience a book...as if for the first time. From the politics, to the incredibly unique powers shown throughout the book, to the personality of the characters, I loved it all. I would definitely recommend The Rook and I'm excited to now dive into Stiletto!"}
{"text": "Ok so let's start out with the good points about this book. Book cover is pretty cool and the idea of this story is promising. Here's the bad news. I was pretty disappointed with this book. The characters drove me nuts and the book seemed to be on the verge of a older young adult book but the characters are what killed that idea. The characters drove me nuts and I honestly felt like there was an invisible Cupid shooting people with his arrows throughout the book. This book was very predictable and I highly doubt I'll continue this series. I wanted to like this book and I desperately tried to like it but this book just didn't work for me. The book covers still draw me to the books but the content doesn't. This book wasn't a match for me. Overall, I would say this book is a 1 out of 5."}

{"text": "\"L'acchiapparatti di Tilos\" e sicuramente un libro particolare, che non potra restare indifferente ai lettori. Francesco Barbi infatti, ha saputo portare una ventata d'aria fresca nel panorama fantasy italiano. Il suo romanzo si discosta dai canoni del fantasy tradizionale e Barbi ci presenta personaggi insoliti, scarti della societa, persone prive di scrupoli e, talvolta, anche di senno. Ho trovato notevole questo libro, che ha costituito il suo esordio letterario. \n Il linguaggio utilizzato dall'autore e piuttosto semplice, anche se il vocabolario di Barbi e comunque molto ricco; il tutto resta comunque molto scorrevole. \n Lo stile e particolare; per via delle vicende narrate, la storia assume spesso delle tinte fosche, l'atmosfera creata da Barbi e quindi misteriosa, quasi gotica. \n Il ritmo del romanzo e incalzante, il libro si lascia leggere velocemente, soprattutto superata la prima meta, quando i nodi cominciano a venire al pettine e il lettore inizia a comprende di piu i dettagli della storia. \n Le descrizioni sono esaustive e dettagliate al punto giusto, senza mai risultare pesanti ne troppo lunghe. \n Come gia accennato poco sopra, i personaggi sono il vero punto forte dell'intero romanzo. Barbi sceglie per la sua storia personaggi del tutto insoliti, difficilmente presi in considerazione dalla letteratura; sono per lo piu scarti della societa, privi di scrupoli e di un qualsiasi principio morale. \n I protagonisti di questa storia sono un becchino storpio e opportunista, che farebbe qualunque cosa pur di raggiungere i suoi scopi; il matto del villaggio al quale sembra proprio mancare qualche rotella, che per non essere tagliato fuori dalla societa si inventa un mestiere tutto suo diventando acchiapparatti; una prostituta golosa di cibo, un gigante che parla solo tramite proverbi e un misterioso cacciatore di taglie sfigurato. Tutti, dal primo all'ultimo, hanno caratteri ben delineati dall'autore, e ognuno svolge il suo importante ruolo. Ho apprezzato molto la scelta di Barbi di prendere in considerazione personaggi sconsiderati, rendendo cosi il suo romanzo originale. Il mio preferito in assoluto rimane Zaccaria Narrish, l'acchiapparatti, che finisce per sorprendere il lettore piu di una volta. I suoi modi di fare e il suo battibeccarsi con Ghescik (il becchino storpio) mi hanno fatto piu volte sorridere durante la lettura, accrescendo il mio sentimento di simpatia nei suoi confronti. Molte sono le scene esilaranti in questo low fantasy, ho apprezzato molto lo humor dell'autore, che contrasta molto con le scene cupe e orrorifiche dedicate al mietitore di Giloc. L'autore ha scelto dunque una buona alternanza tra allegria e serieta, coinvolgendo positivamente il lettore in ogni fase della storia e sciogliendo un po' la tensione con le scene d'ilarita. \n All'interno di questo romanzo sono ravvisabili diversi significati, piu o meno nascosti. La morale de \"L'acchiapparatti di Tilos\" puo essere riassunta nel seguente proverbio: chi e causa del suo mal, pianga se stesso. L'autore denuncia qui il desiderio di immortalita che corrompe l'animo umano, tema che mi ha riportato alla mente per certi versi \"Il ritratto di Dorian Gray\" di Oscar Wilde. Lo stregone Ar-Gular, pur di ottenere la vita eterna e di non vedere il suo corpo macchiarsi con i segni della vecchiaia e la sua anima imputridirsi per via delle scelleratezze compiute, plasma un essere mostruoso, che rispecchia il male insito nell'essere umano. Ed ecco quindi introdursi un nuovo tema: spesso l'uomo utilizza la sua intelligenza per raggiungere scopi mostruosi e compiendo azioni orribili. \n La trama si presenta piuttosto lineare, tuttavia non e priva di colpi di scena. La storia culmina poi in un finale dolce e amaro al tempo stesso, che mi ha fatto rimpiangere il fatto di non poter far comparire altre pagine. Questo romanzo e seguito da \"Il burattinaio\", che non ho ancora avuto il piacere di leggere, purtroppo pero e fuori catalogo a causa del fallimento della casa editrice. \n \"L'acchiapparatti di Tilos\" si rivolge a un pubblico di adulti e ragazzi; lo consiglio a chi ama il genere fantasy, a chi ha voglia di leggere un libro italiano ben scritto ed originale e a chi desidera tuffarsi in una storia che sappia strappare qualche risata, seppure le atmosfere del romanzo restino piuttosto cupe."}
{"text": "Good easy read."}
{"text": "I liked it. I especially liked the beginning, the sarcastic, humorous tone of the book, and the action. It got kind of slow in the beginning/middle and the romance was sweet but kind of sickly because, you know, it was basically necrophilia . What I didn't like was how the beginning high school stuff was cliche, the assumption that all a guy has to do is ignore a girl to get her to fall for you, and the idea of a stereotypical white, blonde prom queen (although I actually liked the character). Also I don't know how to feel about the ending. But, there's a sequel so."}
{"text": "What a waste of my life. Don't bother with this book. There is maybe one, two good stories out of here but even those are hardly worth it.

There are better things to read. \n Conclusion: Not if you paid me."}

{"text": "I obtained this ARC at BEA14, in exchange for an honest review. \n Book 2 in the Dead in the City series doesn't break any paranormal romance molds, but it was a fun and entertaining read nonetheless. \n Taking the immature blond bimbo from the first book and making her the main character was an interesting choice, and one I was not sure I could buy. Humphreys did a good job of flipping my perception though, and she provided depth and a sympathetic background for Maya, so I am glad I gave this novel a try."}
{"text": "Wings, author Aprilynne Pike's debut, tells the story of Laurel as she starts a new school in a cozy California town. Her mom's a homeopath, her dad is opening a bookstore, and her first friend at her new school is a hunky science whiz. When two zit-like bumps appear on her back and keep growing, Laurel has to face the reality of who she is and what her purpose really is. \n Wings is one of the first YA books I've read that caused me to think, \"oh. This is definitely YA.\" Don't misunderstand. Pike's writing feels effortless, her characters are real, and Laurel herself is a kick-ass protagonist. It's not urban fantasy in the sense of Holly Black's \n Tithe, \n but it's less pure fantasy than, for example, Frewin Jones's The Faerie Path. \n A definite choice to buy for girls ages 12-16. Some sex references make it (probably) inappropriate for younger than that. A library check-out for others (YA or fantasy fans, or, strangely, environmentalists)."}

{"text": "See full review for The Iron Knight at: http://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.w... \n Meghan Chase has become the Iron Queen - the ruler of the Iron Fey and Kingdom - and seems to be at relative peace with the Winter and Summer courts. Everything is as it should be, or so it seems. In her final act before she became queen, Meghan released Prince Ash of the Winter court from his promise of knighthood and banished him from the Iron Realm. She knew that if she died, he would follow her soon after and she didn't want that on her conscious. But she didn't die and now Ash has to try and make his way back to her side. \n The problem though is that he's been banished from the Iron Realm and he is still a Winter court faery. The touch of iron could kill him, so he is on a mission. First to find the cat Grimalkin and then to somehow find a soul so that way he can become a mortal and be by Meghan's side. But the task is not easy. For one thing, the jester Puck has decided to join him on his journey and they still have a centuries old feud to put to bed. For another, the journey is perilous and brings out the darker side of Ash, a side he thought he had locked away, and he eventually does turn on his once friend. But when it comes time to deal the killing blow - one that Puck willingly gives him - he can't do it. But that doesn't matter, because what happens next challenges his vow to come back to Meghan's side."}

Heartless was one hundred times better than this 306 paged sob fest. I mean, seriously. At least, Catherine had a backbone and parents who meant well. Dinah is a sniveling weakling, who I really can't believe was going to be the Queen of Hearts, with a father who makes the King of Hearts that I'm writing look like a hero instead of the villain he really is."}

{"text": "Apocalypsis is a really edgy, funny book that puts the really dark, brutal circumstances of the world it is set in into perspective. \n The humor and banter is what keeps this from being too dark and broody. The stark violence and just appalling situations these kids are put in begs for the humor to make it entertaining and not just downright scary. I really felt like it was a perfect blend of the two. \n Once again, Elle Casey delivers a strong female heroine. I absolutely loved the main character. She reminds me a lot of the heroine from War Of the Fae. \n The characters really drive this one home. Bryn is strong, skilled and determined and yet, she has a soft side. Peter is positively adorable and Bodo is just very simplistic and so genuine. He's such a different type of hero because he is so on the surface. I suspect he has a secret but he isn't broody or broken or anything. He offers up his loyalty on a silver platter. \n The early plot starts out a bit predictable. If they need to open a lock, they find something on the ground. If they can't carry their stuff, they find a trailer, etc. But aside from that, the plot is strong. Each event sends you spiraling toward the next, keeping you fully grounded in the story. By the end, it is anything but predictable. \n What I found missing in this one is characters changing as they went through. Most books grab me because I want to partake on the character's journey. This one grabbed me more because of the plot. The characters were likeable and I am definitely invested in them, but it wasn't their emotional journey that left me hooked. I think this book is more plot centric than character centric. \n I will definitely be continuing with this series. It was good enough that I have already bought the second book and begun reading it."}

In this book especially, there was no character growth- the protagonists just went around in endless circles until things were abruptly resolved in the last few pages. \n No terrible, but not what it could have been."}

{"text": "In una Londra di meta ottocento, popolata da creature mostruose e difesa da una discendenza di abili cacciatori, Patrisha Mar crea una storia, che ha in se la bellezza del romanzo storico, unito al mistero dell'urban fantasy ed avvolge il tutto con una splendida nota di romanticismo. In un periodo nel quale la nostra editoria \"sforna\" pessime traduzioni e cover \"mostruose\", la nostra Patrisha mi fa beare di poter leggere un testo scritto in maniera curata, precisa e con quel mistero che contraddistingue ogni capitolo. \n La storia ci porta in una nebbiosa e oscura Londra, dove una stirpe di cacciatori protegge, avvolta dall'anonimato, l'intera popolazione da creature mostruose assetate di sangue. Benjamin e Bernadette due gemelli orfani, sotto la guida del famigerato e un po' inquietante \"The Phoenix\" e con l'aiuto di altri cacciatori, sono protettori di un segreto, gelosamente custodito tra le pagine dell'Oracolo, un libro tramandato da generazioni. \n La narrazione e fluida, scorrevole e sin dalle prime pagine la storia coinvolge, in un crescendo di emozioni e sensazioni, per culminare nella dolcezza di momenti unici. Lo stile usato riesce ad essere sia abbastanza descrittivo e allo stesso tempo non prolisso e ridondante; Patrisha accompagna il lettore in un mondo fantasy, dove pero la componente romance fa da padrone. Ogni personaggio viene descritto in ogni sua peculiarita, sia fisica che caratteriale, in modo tale da fare provare un empatia immediata verso i protagonisti. \n Ben e Cassandra, Joseph e Bernie e il misterioso The Phoenix, riescono a vivere tra le pagine e nella mia immaginazione sin dal primo capitolo, grazie alla penna di Patrisha, che con estrema cura delinea ogni aspetto e racconta ogni emozione. \n Non sono una fan \"dell'istant-love\", ma Patrisha ha saputo rendere questo aspetto un punto di forza del romanzo, perche raffigura l'amore come il fulcro della trama, e di conseguenza mi fa capitolare in maniera totale! \n In tempi nei quali l'originalita e l'ingegno narrativo stanno diventando quasi una chimera, la Mar riesce a ritagliarsi un posticino nel mio cuore di lettrice, merito di uno stile accattivante e dei suo splendidi Book boys! \n Ora, non mi resta che attendere il degno finale, per questa duologia tutta Made in Italy! \n Patrisha si e rivelata una piacevolissima scoperta :) \n Assolutamente consigliato!"}
{"text": "Garden ha tutte le premesse per essere un gran bel distopico,ma a parte l'inizio, non brilla in quanto a trama e originalita. \n Le similitudini con alcuni famosi distopici salta subito all'occhio e nonostante la Romero abbia un'ottima idea di fondo, la storia sembra sempre troppo surreale per essere credibile. Ho costantemente l'impressione di avere \"gia letto\" questo o quel fatto... e la protagonista sistematicamente si contraddice con le sue scelte: ora coraggiosa e pronta a sfidare il mondo... adesso indecisa e sempre in paranoia! \n Deciditi figlia mia che le lancette corrono -.-'' I personaggi secondari fanno da tappezzeria per movimentare la situazione; i protagonisti maschili sono usati per dare un tocco romantico/colpo di scena alla trama. \n L'ambientazione che doveva permettere alla storia di diversificarsi dagli altri libri e pressoche inesistente. L'Italia, Roma o il Kazakistan non farebbe differenza... solo un breve accenno ai colli in qualche occasione, poi nulla che dia l'idea di dove la storia si svolga! \n La trama, a mio avviso, manca di descrizioni e fatti che avrebbero reso il tutto piu chiaro e articolato. Molte incognite (come il perche le arti vengano proibite) non trovano risposta. Situazioni complicate e pericolose che puff! si risolvono con una semplicita assurda. \n Garden, ovvero il giardino di pace e liberta alla fine e una totale delusione... un finale troppo aperto e presentato in maniera frettolosa per un libro che e stato presentato come auto-conclusivo. \n Non riesco a sconsigliarvi tale lettura, perche lo stile e gradevole, ciononostante questo a me non e bastato! \n Questo libro non e stato cio che avevo sperato, non ha saputo coinvolgermi nella sua lettura. \n Pur trattandosi di un romanzo d formazione, l'autrice avrebbe dovuto dare alla trama maggiore intensita e originalita, caratterizzando in modo piu incisivo persone e ambientazione. Non mi sento di bocciarlo in toto, perche lo stile della Romero e senza dubbio buono, adesso non mi resta che aspettare un nuovo libro!"}

{"text": "See full review for Frozen at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n Back in 2013, before Disney made the name Frozen so freaking popular, there was a book by two authors. But this story wasn't about an ice queen, her sister and an adorable snowman; this tale was about a girl who was different from most of the population and her struggle to get back to where she was originally from. \n In the future, the world is covered in ice. The ozone is gone and most of the countries aren't what we know anymore. The United States of America is now the Remaining States of America. Las Vegas is now New Vegas - because if there is a city to survive the end of the world why not let it be the city of sin? And Natasha is a blackjack dealer at the casino, but she's more than just that. There is a voice in her head, a mark of flame on her breast, and her green eyes are now no longer the norm but something to be feared. She is different and she needs to get out of New Vegas before it's too late. But she doesn't know how. It's too expensive to go through normal means and the last time she tried to hop the fence, she was caught and put into a government facility. She barely escaped with her life. \n But a new opportunity presents herself when a runner named Wes shows up at her table and tries to run a con on her with his team. Instead of getting the platinum credits like he wanted, the credits disappear and he's thrown out of the casino. However, Wes and Nat aren't done yet, not when she hires him to get her out of New Vegas and to the coast of New Crete where the legendary land of the Blue is. There are dangers out there though and this sort of journey is not for the faint of heart."}

{"text": "\"Ti sento\", romanzo d'esordio di Cassidy McCormack. Si tratta di uno YA che ha per protagonisti gli angeli, per la precisione angeli della morte. \n Lui, Alessandro, ultimo erede della stirpe semi-immortale degli Angeli della Morte. Lei, Denise, figlia di un membro del Clan del suo piu acerrimo nemico.Il destino beffardo li mettera sulla stessa strada, risvegliando ricordi amari assopiti da tempo, che daranno il via al piu sanguinoso dei conflitti. \n Alessandro studente di medicina 23 anni, bello e arrogante ma fragile, ha alle spalle un'infanzia traumatica e dolorosa. Perche lui non e un ragazzo normale, fa parte degli Ancharos, gli Angeli della Morte, e un Nocchiere, colui che accompagna le anime dei morti nell'Hahicos, in attesa del giorno del giudizio. \n Gli Ancharos sono in costante guerra con i nemici giurati di sempre, gli agenti del clan. Ma e proprio per difendere Denise, figlia del capo del clan, che arriva a mettersi contro la sua stessa famiglia. \n Tutto il romanzo e narrato al presente dal protagonista ma con continui scorci del passato. La storia in certi punti sembra veramente solo il flusso dei pensieri di Alex, in questi momenti non si puo che condividere i suoi stati d'animo ed entrare in sintonia con lui! Anche se a volte proprio i suoi ragionamenti contorti mi hanno spesso fatto perdere il filo del discorso (Alex a volte pensa in maniera snervante!) \n Trovo che l'autrice sia stata brava nel creare questa alternanza di presente e passato mantenendo una certa suspance nel lettore e a svelare man mano i fatti salienti. \n Nell'ultima parte del libro l'intreccio tra passato e presente termina... unendosi al primo capitolo del libro e da li in poi rimane sempre al presente. \n I personaggi della storia hanno tutti un carattere ben delineato ma tra tutti Alex spicca, non solo perche e il protagonista, ma per il suo carattere fragile e dolce nascosto accuratamente dietro una maschera di arroganza e irruenza. Tutto in lui e il risultato di un'infanzia segnata da traumi, violenze e abusi, quelli che e stato costretto a subire all'accademia, e dai rapporti conflittuali con un padre distante ed un nonno autoritario. Infatti e costantemente combattuto tra quello che e in realta e quello che deve mostrare di essere a tutti. \n L'amicizia con Denise, fragile compagna di universita vittima dei soprusi del branco nonche figlia del capo del clan rivale, il modo nel quale tenta di salvarla, anche mettendosi contro la sua famiglia, dimostrano il suo animo buono e il grande spirito di protezione che lo anima! \n La bellissima, intensa e passionale storia d'amore con la sua Celine, con lei Alex apre il suo cuore e la sua anima, condividendo tutto il dolore, l'angoscia e le sue debolezze, ma anche l'amore piu dolce e travolgente che\" sentono\" entrambe poiche condividono una parte di anima. Quando Alex parla di lei lo fa con un tale amore che mi fa sciogliere \n Suspense, colpi di scena, lotte rocambolesche ma anche amicizia e passione rendono questo romanzo ben articolato... ammetto di essere stata scettica per parecchi capitoli all'inizio, ma capitolo dopo capitolo mi sono trovata ad apprezzarlo sempre di piu!! \n Lettura piacevole"}

Could just be fond fuzzy memories of the beginning of the tale."}

{"text": "I was not impressed with this story. I was excited to find out what happened to get Magnus Bane banned from Peru. The Mortal Instrument series often references Magnus' lifetime ban, but keeps the reason a mystery. In this story, Magnus goes on several adventures, but I didn't really care. None of it is related to the rest of the Shadowhunter world and it reveals nothing new to Magnus' personality or past. What the story reflects is nothing he don't really know about him. There are no epiphany's here."}
{"text": "Although I enjoyed the Twilight series, I did not think it was well-written. The Host (in my opinion) showed that Stephenie Meyer can really write. Of course, I think I should get a medal for making it through any book this long that isn't Harry Potter, but that's a different story."}
{"text": "Darcy Harrison doesn't care must for pottery but goes along with his brother Mac to an art show. His brother is in hopes to get his Rickson pottery appraised. Brooke Rickson has made pottery along side her great grandfather and is just as famous as he was and a recluse since he passed away. When Darcy got Brooke's scent he knew she was his mate. She knows what that means and tells him under no circumstances was that happening and she was definitely not taking orders from him or anyone else. Can Darcy persuade her that they are meant to be together and that he won't change her life? Will Darcy protect her from those that want to hurt her? Another great read and would recommend to all as a must read."}

{"text": "This book was a bit of a disappointment for me. There was so much going on, it felt like a jumbled mess. I don't even think it's about Manny and Payne, more about V (and his parts I loved). No big climax at the end, just meh...."}
{"text": "Definitely a different kind of read...quirky yet weird, while action-packed and humorous. However, for some readers it might be slightly disturbing (ie non-consensual sex). By the end of the book, there is little if any resolution to the storyline. But it leaves the series with potential of future world-building, overall character growth and what makes the heroine tick. \n After reading the book, I was slightly confused on the good versus the bad. Nor does it seem that the situation of the new world that Sasha is thrown into is ever explained other than bits here and there. \n Overall the heroine is comical (even in less than ideal circumstances) and it will be interesting to see the development of a relationship between Sasha and Stefen."}
{"text": "This book was amazing cover to cover!! A mix of fantasy, sci fi and dystopian elements, the book followed Darrow as he begins his search for justice. The plot was full of twists, many unpredictable and I loved that about it. I cannot wait to read the next book!!"}
{"text": "I loved it. It was very engrossing and pulled me in from the start. Ryann is an orphan who was sold to be a sclava (slave). Her duties are to be at the beck and call of the Lord's fourteen year old son, Bramwel. He's spoiled and mean, whipping or beating whomever of his sclava's he chooses. \n Ryann wants to buy her freedom, she only needs to save twenty silver pieces but only gets paid fifteen copper coins per week, of which it costs her five for room and board and then clothes every now and then, and if she gets any beatings she has to pay as well. It takes twenty copper coins to make a silver coin. As you can see the chances of her buying her freedom are pretty slim. But she comes up with another plan... \n The characters were well developed. I was pulled right in to Ryann's struggles and kept hoping that something would go her way. For a novella this was well crafted and held my rapt attention. I look forward to reading more by this author."}
{"text": "This book barely held my attention at all. I finished it in hopes of greater excitement; also dragons. Not really my cuppa. The premise is neat enough with the shape-shifting and whatnot. Where you lose me is the remaining dormant until a star masquerading as a person awakens you. I do not think so, but I didn't write it. So what do I know? From what I do know of dragon lore, their hides are impenetrable; this makes later scenes in the novel a tad tough to choke down, realistically within the universe created. \n I give this two stars because the use of imagery was very well done. Other than that this book was a bit of a wash, if I'm being honest: I always strive for that. Cheers all, until next review."}
{"text": "Jean-Baptiste, Vicomte de Martell is said to be a crusader but is given the description of a pirate with one eye and a hook instead of a left hand. It is a bit odd that this crusader-pirate is given a French name but lives in Saarland, Germany (even if it is a fairy tale). \n Like with all fairy tales, the element of magic is present. It is different here; a black pearl that changes Lady Avezoete (who represents the princess in traditional fairy tales). \n The full moon is usually when the werewolf transforms from human to beast, but in The Lady Wolf, it is slightly in reverse. It is when Lady Avezoete decides to take out the black pearl from her mouth and return to her human form. \n Overall, The Lady Wolf is an enjoyable short story with a happy ending, or double happy ending."}

{"text": "Calling it quits. Tired of trying to get through the stress inducing, no respite book. I might have slogged through to the end but read the author note at the end that stated, due to the book getting so long, he split the book in two with each book focusing on specific characters. The 5th book is the one that focuses on the characters I was a little more attached to. No intention of picking up that book. \n These are good books; well written, huge plot, huge world. Just not my thing. I'd prefer Martin take a note from the Bard and add a little comedy. Something to get us through the tragedy of it all. Unfortunately, not even the fools in the series were funny. Others may have other opinions. This one is mine."}

I liked the progression, but somehow I missed intensity like I saw in the first book. \n WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME? \n The last third of the book was what I enjoyed--the action-finally getting a good look at The Lunar Army--the close call by the ship. \n Meh. I can't even articulate a proper review. I am definitely underwhelmed."}
{"text": "I loved the Percy Jackson series and I liked the Kane Chronicles, so of course I needed to read the crossover stories. \n The final chapter of this crossover. It starts with Percy and Annabeth, told by Percy's pov. They are trying to fight against the one that has caused all these events and encounters, who is trying to become both a Greek and Egyptian god and to absorb all other gods and rule everything. With Carter and Sadie's help, they will join their magic and fight together to stop him from becoming immortal. \n I liked the story. I missed Percy's pov, he it a character that I love. I love all the parallels between the characters, and how he can see both himself and Annabeth on Sadie. I didn't really knew that both mythologies coexisted and merge in Alexandria, so that was interesting. I missed the greek component a bit, it was too much of the egyptian world, but it was s till fun."}
{"text": "When I started reading this book, I was afraid it wasn't going to turn out to be a fantasy after all. It starts out in England just after WWII, but instead of using the real-world situation as a mere pretext to quickly whisk the reader off to another land, as in Narnia or the Wizard of Oz or Alice in Wonderland, Holdstock spends the first half of the book immersing us in the narrator's history and lifestyle in the real world. I started to fear that this book would turn out to be like The Wood Wife or Little Big, where we only get tantalizing glimpses of creatures from the other realm and never go there ourselves. But then at the halfway point, things finally started happening, and they were all the more effective for our having been so deeply immersed in the quotidian details of Steven's life before. I guess the fantastic seems even more fantastic when contrasted with something real! I won't spoil the ending of the book except to say that it also surprised me greatly. Now I can't wait to read the sequel."}
{"text": "I really wanted to like the book as it started out really strong for myself but it didn't keep the pace. I found the parents to be a little out there and some of the stuff they did like never listening to the kids and such a little out of character. \n The two kids didn't seem to gel to me, not because I'm an adult they just rubbed me the wrong way. And the fact that every twist and turn in this book got the plot more and more complicated didn't help. \n When they added the time travel element I knew that was it for me just one too many elements that made the book seem a little disjointed to myself."}
{"text": "I really wish this book had panned out. I read over 100 pages. Had no idea what was going on, struggled to keep reading and just gave up. \n The characters weren't as developed as I would like, the writing was confusing, the setting confusing everything was confusing. \n That being said I could tell Leah Bobet has extreme talent, and a gifted ability to bring a story to life. I just don't think this book worked for me."}
{"text": "Juliette and Adam are at Omega Point, a place where rebels live and people with unique skills like her call home. Soon they learn that Adam also has an ability, and that is why he can touch Juliette. But she knows Warner can also touch her, even tough she won't tell anyone about it. Adam has no control of his ability, so Juliette can hurt and even kill him while they are together. And when the president come's to the 45th district to hunt Juliette, the war against the Reestablishment seems inevitable. \n I didn't like this books as much. It reminded me a LOT to Never Fade. But it was not as good. \n For once, it was boring. I wanted to see a group of rebels with superpowers, working and planning together, learning and training. But most of it was people staying away from Juliette, Adam being a jerk and Juliette crying. That's it. I get it, Juliette is healing and discovering her strength, but she was so passive it drove me insane. Every time something happened, she was shocked, couldn't move or say a thing. And all she did was cry and isolate herself. Every other character except for Adam and maybe Kenji was just plain and useless. They were all decor and spectators while the whole Adam-Juliette drama happened. I was over the teen drama quickly and didn't get any of the action I expected until the end. \n The whole relationship thing made no sense. Are they so desperate that they can't keep their hands away? Can't they just kiss once in a while but enjoy each others company for a while, until both can handle their powers? I get they are teenagers and they have hormones and love each other and Juliette is obsessed with being touched since she had such a deprivation of it, but its too extreme and they are way too immature. And the way they couldn't communicate, couldn't talk and kept everything to themselves, even IMPORTANT stuff, made me so mad. Juliette can't seem to trust anyone, and while I understand she's like that because of her history, I just can't stand her anymore. \n The only fun thing was Kenji at times, and Warner. He was interesting and discovering his real personality was expected but still nice. He really is in love with Juliette and all he did was because he has to keep a front. You can see that we'll learn more about himself and he'll probably redeem himself because I'm done with Adam. \n Also, Adam being Warner's brother was crazy and way too forced. It's probably a way to unite them at the end but it made no sense. \n I like that Juliette died but was healed and now I'm hoping we'll finally see a kickass heroine. I hope she pulls herself up and the war finally begins."}

{"text": "I want to give this 3.75 stars but I just love Rose character so much. So.. 4 stars it is! :p (I think the reason why this book got a high rating and tons of five stars, is because people compare it Twilight) \n P.S. The only thing I ship more than Christian for Liss? Rose. Hah."}
{"text": "What I liked about this book is the teenagers acted like regular teenages. They seemed more realistic than other YA novels I have read in the past. Some smoke, drink, swear, have attitude (or what I like to call teen angst), dress inappropriately, focus on their love lives (or lack thereof) and they don't get along with their parents. Too many times I have read YA books where the protagonist was more mature, intelligent, resourceful and generally more put together than I am in my adult years. It was almost as if they were written too perfectly in neat cookie cutter profiles. In these books, the characters make mistakes and actually spend time on self discovery which is what something I could relate to when I was the protagonist's age. \n The story itself was also very interesting. To live your first sixteen years thinking you are someone only to find out there's a whole other world out there, a secret world you are a part of is pretty cool. I really liked Kaye's spunky personality as she adjusts and grows throughout the book. She slowly learns the truths about her past and gets tangled up in fearie politics and she tries to find out where she truly belongs."}

But to save the Hatter, she has to see the one person she doesn't want to see again, Caterpillar. Caught between her new life and the past, Alice must make a decision that will impact the rest of her life! Love the world building in Victorian London. A must read!

{"text": "Nyx has been born and raised to marry a demon. Her whole life she was treated as a weapon, never loved by her family. She resents her father, who made the bargain and is cold with her, her aunt who instructs her and sleeps with her father, and twin sister, the one chosen to live. \n But when she meets Ignifez, he's different that what she imagined. She knows she has to follow her father's plan and try to end the curse that has fallen in the island, but she discovers that the curse may not be as simple as she imagined. \n I really liked this book. At first, it reminded me Uprooted, but at the end, I felt it really similar to Wintersong. I didn't love it as much as the first, but I enjoyed it more than the last. It captivated me and it was enchanting and sweet. I could feel like it was a retelling of the Beauty and the Beast but at the same time, it was really different, with its own mythology and plot twists. \n I loved Ignifex, but I wish we could get to know him more. At times he felt a bit flat. Shade was a great character, and the same can be said about Astraia, but I wish we could see a bit more about her true personality. \n And Nyx... I loved her too. She is strong but full of anger and is one of the darkest characters I've read in a YA story. Definitely the first that betrays her lover willingly . \n I loved the ending, it felt right and perfect. Ignifex being one with Shade and being the last prince, and sacrificing himself for his kingdom was perfect. It was bittersweet that reality changed and still Nyx's mother died, but in this new time she had a great relationship with her sister and a better one with her father and aunt, and at the end gets to save Lux."}

Pip is a fae and when she met Burke's nephew, Shane, they formed an instant bond. \n There is a madman targeting Shane and his brother, Walter, and Pip tries to save them -- can she save them both?

{"text": "This is a really sweet book. \n I wasn't sure that I would get on with it - I don't find werewolves appealing in the slightest (Team Vamp all the way - apart from Oz in Buffy the Vampire Slayer) but it was much better than I thought. People have compared this book unfavourably to Twilight - I'm not going to do that, I'm going to take it as an individual story. That said, Grace is a much more likeable character than Bella and Sam a much less creepy version of Edward. \n For what it is, it is a pleasant enough read - it is a paranormal romance for young teens and you have to take it at that value - this is why the emo poetry thing works even though the song lyrics seem pretty disjointed. \n I liked that the wolves changed because of the weather rather than any primal need - this was a nice touch. \n At times the book just seemed to be waiting for something to happen - eg we went to school, we chilled in my room all week until xyz happened, but these bits went by quickly but did give the impression that they were leading a boring adult life rather than the teenage passion that they were supposed to be experiencing. That said it was a relief for the relationship not to be primal a la other paranormal romance books, it was loving, safe and sweet, and I really got the impression that they adored each other on a pure level. \n So, overall, a nice and sweet story. Nothing stunning but certainly not as bad as some reviewers might have you believe! I'd like to read the next books to see where the story go."}
{"text": "4.5 Stars \n Gareth Kendrick is the last true bard of the Seelie. His voice has the power to command people to fall in love, heal, or commit themselves to their doom. He's always been wary of his power, and scared of the voices of the dead that haunt him ever since his tutelage by the ghost of Gwyddion, the most recently deceased bard before Gareth. \n Gareth loved only one man in his long-spanning life: Niall. Niall was a human, or so Gareth thought and they met \"by chance\" nearly two hundred years ago in the human realm where Gareth chose to live the bulk of his life. For Gareth, Niall was all and everything, and he dispaired greatly when he saw an Unseelie escort Niall through the realms to Faerie. HE was sure Niall was lost to him forever. \n The true was much different. Niall was a half-Fae Unseelie prince sent to kill Gareth, but he fell in love with the man instead. His brother learned of the situation and escorted Niall back to their father as a favor, so Niall could plead his love and ask a boon to be released from his oath. Their father refused and sent Niall into one of the hells of their realm, Govannon's forge, to toil for the past two hundred years in retribution for his treachery. Niall endured the punishment because it ensured that Gareth would not be murdered by another of his father's minions. \n Fast-forward: Faerie is dying and a powerful Mage is planning to rescue it with a remaking spell, but it requires all of the Fae to be present. This includes Niall, whose brother-now the King of the Unseelie-has rescued from Govannon's forge. And, when Niall sees Gareth he knows he can't tell the truth. Gareth, instead of performing his part in the new magic, steals Niall away from the ceremony, sure that a \"human\" could not withstand the magic of the rite. \n Unfortunately, when they flee Faerie they upset the balance and the spell to fix Faerie goes awry. Oh, and it's not cool when Gareth learns his 'dead Human' lover is really a living Unseelie Prince. It's hard going for a bit, but a reconciliation is brokered by David and Bryce, the non-Seelie mates of Gareth's brothers. By connecting with those men, Gareth sees the folly of condemning interspecies mating, and Niall is able to win his heart back. Oh, and save all the realms from the power-mad Mage who had a whole different plan in mind. Expect high stakes, mad love and healed hearts by the end. There's a wee bit of sexytimes, but it's more emotion than motion. \n This is the end of the trilogy, which I think is best read in order, but there's a window to new adventures left open, where Niall and Mal can hit the road to find lost Fae in the human realm. I'd tag along for that... I read a review copy provided by NetGalley."}
{"text": "This was just as gripping as the first two books (although, spoiler alert, without the sexy. I think this is intentional as the POV characters are all female in a manner of speaking and that tends to make for a focus on romance, but I still missed it.) \n The ending, though... what was that ENDING? It was like the tension got to a climax, final battle about to happen and... it never happens, you jump to the epilogue."}
{"text": "Very good--full of surprises like the rest of the series--sad to see the characters go, but I think it was a good wrap up over all :-)"}

{"text": "Damn, damn, damn. I howled in pain when I realised the next book is about Kirra. Dammit. I hoped SO MUCH we would see more of Senneth and especially her relationship with Tayse. Aside from all romantic crap it was interesting. I really cracked up when he was imagining how he comes up, kneel before her or bow way lower than to the king and tell her he loves her, I mean... come on. Pure maiden-yes, but tough soldier who not long ago only saw his purpose in life as serving to king? Not so much... \n I was suprised that female auhtor could pull off such nice romance story (usually they really suck at it). At the end of the book I wasn't so sure about the brilliance Mrs Shinn. It started great, then it went the way every romantic female wants it to go. I hated it. Aside from complaints about relationship issues which are of great importance to me the book was rather good. I didn't like lack of explanation to powers. Like how Senneth is able to do almost anything. I had some problems with this book but I cannot really pinpoit what was exactly wrong becuase there were just feelings during reading (some sense of wrongness when they appeared to have all the convenient skills, heck, Cammon in himself was way too much of a convenient thing), well blanketed by great pleasure of reading itself. All in all, rare 4 stars from me. \n I have to admit I loved Cammon from the start and I sooo regretted him not having more wicked character, he could meddle beautifully in this little group. And I am usually very peacefull and I hate all the conflict and underhanded methods especially toying with other people. I cannot explain why I wishes for him to be MORE so much. I wondered with shiver of excitement what would become of him when he grows up. He's got to be hella interesting and I do hope he won't become loyal, boring tool in king's hand. I want him to have will of his own. He already has such a great advantage."}
{"text": "\"It is the most beautiful nightmare I have ever seen.\""}
{"text": "Monsters Exist is a collection of 14 short stories from the worlds of horror and often the dark paranormal, written by a great assortment of horror-writing authors, most of whose names already strike fear in the reader! \"Kleaver, Buller, Demmer, Deadman...\" \n I'm commenting on each story and giving it a rating, apart from the overall rating of the whole anthology. \n \"Master Vermin\" by Wallace Boothill \n The anthology opens with an interesting piece that is different from what you'd define as horror. There is a significant bit of well-fitted gross descriptions in this story. I liked the suspense and how the ending was unexpected. It gives you a different kind of scary; a creepy thought rather than simply a scary story. \n Rating: 3.75 stars. \n \"Legend Trippers\" by Theresa Braun \n \"Like a clogged water pipe finally bursting, the images materialised.\" \n My second read for Braun, the story is about a myth of horned-creature called the \"Goatman\", who supposedly \"lure[s] victims to their death, straight into an oncoming train.\" A reporter trails a man called Jaxon because he, the reporter, believes that Jaxon has seen the Goatman, but Jaxon doesn't know what he's seen. Jaxon teams up with a waitress to find out what happened to her sister near the area where an accident had happened at an earlier time. \n The pace is slow at first and towards the middle, then picks up and makes a good ending. \n There are many quote-worthy bits and I love Braun's use of imagery. \n Rating: 4 stars. \n \"The Murder of Crows\" by S.J. Budd \n \"He felt death's close proximity that night, and this time it was coming for him.\" \n Barry, a taxi driver, has taken to killing a woman each night, for three nights in a row, until one woman gets into his car and his whole life changes. \n I loved the start, middle, and flow of this story but felt the ending was abrupt. I like the paranormal aspect, but felt that the main character or the author, or both, wanted to get the story over with. \n After a second reading, I'd give this story a 4-star rating. \n \"Wicked Congregation\" by Gary Buller \n \"Wicked Congregation\" is simply a wicked - pun intended - story! I loved it! \n One of the best stories in the anthology, Buller's piece takes an abandoned chapel for a setting. Narrated from the first person perspective of a High Peak Ranger, \"Wicked Congregation\" is about a remote town where Rangers have to make a sacrifice every two decades or all hell will break loose. \n \"Every twenty years they take a piece of our future so we may keep the rest.\" \n The flow, writing style and the suspense was well done. \n Rating: 5 stars \n \"Playing Dead\" by S.E. Casey \n I like Casey's choice of setting in this short story. I felt the story was a bit long, but I liked it \n Set in a carnival, Casey had me guessing throughout the story what the horror would be and what would happen. The story has this strong opening: \"Under the golden eye of Saturn, the only celestial light visible in the pre-night sky, the field vomited up a monstrosity.\" \n Rating: 4 stars. \n \"Lake Monster\" by Mr. Deadman \n \"The air was chilly and quiet, like a morgue, the sort of quiet that puts a keen emphasis on every sound, no matter how insignificant.\" \n Paranormal or not paranormal? This story keeps you guessing till the end. It's a bit different from the rest and there's a bit of comedy embedded in and some beautiful images. I truly enjoyed this one and didn't know what to think or expect throughout. \n Rating: 5 stars. \n \"Never Sleep Again\" by Calvin Demmer \n Sleep? Who wants to sleep? Definitely not me. Especially after reading this story! \n Another paranormal piece, I like that \"Never Sleep Again\" mixes mystery with creepy. I don't want to give anything else away. You just have to read it. \n Rating: 5 stars. \n \"The Voice from the Bottom of the Well\" by Philip W. Kleaver \n Smart, wicked, and creepy are the first words that come to mind when I read this piece by Kleaver. And \"Damn brilliant\". Short stories with children tend to be creepier than anything and Kleaver nailed it with \"The Voice from the Bottom of the Well\". His word choice and flow kept me on edge. I was terrified. \n When reading this short story, I covered my ears in the hopes that I won't be horrified, like I do when watching scary movies. \n Taking this story to a full length novel may also be plausible and it would make for a freaky scary movie. \n Rating: 5 stars. \n \"Eclipse at Wolfcreek\" by Sylvia Mann \n The story opens with a statement and reiteration of the anthology title \"Monsters exist.\" It then moves to naming the three types of monsters. My only problem with this story was that I felt there was some strong scientific jargon. \n Narrated from the perspective Buddy, the story is a tackles creepy differently as we get the description of Buddy's grandmother (you'll love her but she'll freak you out) and the setting. A house in the middle of nowhere. Buddy and his friend Prez go out hunting out of season in the woods near Buddy's home. Suffice to say, they should have listened to Buddy's grandma. \n Rating: 4.5 stars \n \"No. 7\" by William Marchese \n \"No. 7\" is an interesting piece mixing science fiction with the paranormal. There were some confusing parts during the confrontation but overall I enjoyed the story and the narration. It's not as scary as the rest but definitely worth reading. \n Rating: 3.5 stars \n \"Criatura\" by John Palisano \n With lots of dark humour, \"Criatura\" is a must-read scary and fairly gory story. Stranded in the middle of the desert at night, the narrator, Chuck, stumbles upon a creature that was only a myth told to children. I liked the way Palisano gave the reader background information about the \"Criatura\". \n Rating: 4.5 stars \n \"Bitten\" by Christopher Powers \n I couldn't pinpoint the era/timeline in which \"Bitten\" was set; it could be anything, though it felt like the 60's or 70's. I like how Powers weaved a story within a story, merging them at the end. \n Rating: 4.5 stars \n \"Kelpies\" by Leo X. Robertson \n Like \"Master Vermin\", this story isn't scary in terms of the content but the idea, it just leaves you thinking \"DAMN!\" \"No!\" \n It's one of the best pieces in Monsters Exist. It makes you wonder who the 'monster' is here. I thought the description of the kelpies was a little - too - weird though. Still, I kept thinking about the story several days after I finished it. \n Rating: 5 stars \n \"Bloodstream Revolution\" by M.R. Tapia \n The conclusion to the anthology, Tapia's \"Bloodstream Revolution\" has a historical fiction feel to it along with a little gory-paranormal. Reminiscent of the \"survival of the fittest\" idea, the story has a heartbreaking beginning. I could picture every single event quite well in this story. \n Rating: 4.5 stars \n Normally, it's hard to judge a full anthology or short story collection as there tend to be pieces that you dislike or like less than others. But the authors in the Monsters Exist anthology produced quality scary stories. Some I felt were a bit gory, there was significant profanity (fine with me but just mentioning that). What they all did was border on the dark side of the paranormal. \n I must say I enjoyed the different settings, ideas, and overall assortment of scary tales in this book. \n (Note to readers: There is adult content and cursing in the book) \n Overall rating for Monsters Exist: 5 stars! \n Note: I received a free copy of Monsters Exist from one of the authors in exchange for an honest review."}
{"text": "9th&up. Rather unimpressive beginning, but does picks up a bit later. Starts off like a first draft of Twilight- a mysterious boy saves a girl from being run over by a car in the school parking lot and then denies his heroics. He has a secret and a dark side that keeps him aloof from the general population, but the heroine is drawn to him reagrdless. There's even a scene where Camelia and Ben get paired up as lab partners in Chemistry. \n After the first third of Twilight-by-numbers writing, the latter part of the book does get a little interesting; what with Ben's ability being revealed, the \"who can you trust\" game and a stalker with evil plans for our scared heroine. \n All told- not terrible, but not all that much to recommend it either."}
{"text": "Um. Can I have the second book now? Pretty please? :) \n Seriously, this was the first book in MONTHS that I have read in less than a day. It was just that compelling and interesting. Can't wait for the next book!"}
{"text": "See full review for Three Dark Crowns at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n Do not let the summary fool you, this whole book - all 398 pages of it - does not involve the fight for the crown at all. If anything this is a prequel of things to come in the next book and I wished I would have known that."}
{"text": "Let this be a lesson to me, if my gut tells me a book is bad don't continue to read a series in the hopes that it'll get better because your gut is probably always right. \n I don't know where to start with Inheritance, the book was that big of a mess. So I'll just randomly jump in with my review - \n This whole book revolves around an epic war that is being fought between two sides. Most epic wars have epic battles or so you'd think, but not this one. Paolini tries to add blood, guts and gore to the story but the attempts are almost laughable. \n And can we take a moment to talk about the final battle? The BIG fight between Eragon and evil king? What the heck? Can you say, the readers got taken for a ride. This whole series was a bit build-up to nothing. \n Don't even get me started on the belief that Eragon and the Varden are really the bad guys. Someone explain to me how the \"bad guy\" was really bad? Yes he stole the eggs, but why was he bad? My question was never really answered, and the ending of the book only made me even more confused as the Varden started acting just like the \"bad guy\". I will forever believe the Varden were the bullies in this book, and we the readers were following evil people, who kill for their own good. Maybe I would have known why the bad guy was bad had he - ya know - actually SHOWN UP in the books before this volumn. \n Inheritance has the main characters that were the same from previous books. In fact, not one new character is really brought into the book. Sure there are a few tossed into there loosely at the end but really it's the same people. So why, I ask, are we loaded and bogged down with pages and pages of descriptions of the same people that we knew from books past? \n I really think, on a basic children's book scale, this whole series has a good idea... yes an idea. But the way the author goes about it is totally wrong. This book just confirmed my belief that no one edited this book. Yes soemone read it over for grammar mistakes and spelling but no one said \"Hey Christopher... do we really need 50 pages describing a person walking.\" or \"Do you really think we need to read about a man's fingernails in depth\". \n Let's talk about side trips for a moment. Side trips, when done properly, can be great plot/character builders. When done wrong, they are just lengthy pages added to a book. The side trips in this book are just elements that could be cut out of the book. Take for example, them flying to an island. It could be quickly covered in a few paragraphs. But no, our fearless characters have to encounter a storm, in which they see many great creatures. Okay, so maybe it sounds interesting but it's just lengthy and adds nothing to an already long and boring book. Added to the fact that the creatures never come back into the story and the reader if left thinking \"What did I just read and why\". \n To add to the lengthy side trips there's the birth indicent in the first few chapters of the book. A villager is giving birth to a baby girl, but the girl has a cleft pallet. The readers are then overwhelmed with several lengthy chapters on the chelft pallet, why it's bad, how it'll hurt the girl. We then have Eragon come and heal the cleft pallet, while others watch. And then..... nothing. The girl isn't a major character, the magic didn't do anything, NOTHING CAME FROM THIS. So why, were we burdened with this? Why not just let the lady give birth? Why add more than was necessary? \n The ending of the book was almost predictible, and the final war ends and we the readers STILL have to read another 300 pages of months of \"rebuilding\" for nothing. \n So after four books, nearly a billion pages, and a very lengthy journey do I feel complete? No, not by any stretch of the imagination. The book ends with this..... the possibility of more books. Every single thing is left open for MORE FRICKEN BOOKS. All I can say is \"good luck\" with the next series because it'll take a lot of work, and maybe MAYBe with a good editor or some beta readers who actually tell you the truth you might have a good series. But really I feel taken and incomplete by this series and that makes me sad. However, I am happy it's done and over for now."}
{"text": "This was a slog of a book from the beginning, and I marked it DNF. There's no charm to this story, and all of the characters felt flat. Katrina's a mustache twirling villain, and it's not that there's a lot introduce early in the book, but the world building is so thin and clumsy that I never got interested in the story. Katrina is a fire elemental, but this book starts too fast for me to care about Cade or Katrina and their backgrounds. Then it switches to Mara and her sickness too fast for me to care about her. Then 'weeks, even months' pass, which is a huge time skip in the first quarter of a book. A time skip this large at the beginning of the novel means that it didn't start in the right place. I really love werewolf books, but I have to care about the characters for them to work, and that never happened once in the first third of this book. The characters were just thin to me, and I never connected with them."}
{"text": "Barnes presents in The Garden of Stones a well developed, fully laid out world. The reader is catapulted into the conflict head first, and although those first few chapters are confusing, chaotic scenes of fighting between factions in a war we don't understand, it all makes sense soon enough. \n At first, the cast of characters seems daunting. Names, species, factions, how will you keep it all straight? While Barnes' world is fully realized, it is a departure from the familiar. New nomenclatures are nothing new to fantasy readers, which is fortunate. But beneath the strange and new, the book really only focuses on three characters and those that orbit them. Indris, the warrior scholar and principal character. Corajidin, his rival in this book and all around mostly bad guy. Mari, daughter of Corajidin, torn between loyalty to her father and burgeoning feelings for Indris and the honor of her career. \n All the while, Barnes paints a promise. There will be action, there will be intrigue, there will be cliff hangers that compel us to read further. I believe Barnes delivers on that promise in this book - the Garden of Stones was well worth the read. \n Thanks to Amazon and Netgalley for the review copy of this book. It was provided in exchange for an honest review."}

{"text": "When this series began, there were complaints from some reviewers that the destruction of Windwir seemed too inconsistent. Why did Neb survive, but not others? What was the nature of the destruction that it could raze the city, but leave random individuals untouched? At the time, I attributed this to the randomness of destructive nature - if you've ever looked at what did and didn't survive a tornado as it decimates a community, you know what I mean. \n Antiphon takes a stab at starting to give the rationale in the context of the Nine Lands, and yeah, I didn't see that coming :) \n Antiphon is a worthy continuation of the Psalms of Isaak, in what can only be described now as a science fiction epic, shrouded in fantasy, with the drapery of steampunk and the trappings of...fantasy. Bah. Post-apocalyptic apocalyptic fiction? \n Whatever classification system you use, I call it a good fun read. Probably not the best place to dive into the story, still a great read. Enjoyed it!"}
{"text": "I liked the plot summary of Other because it seemed like it would include lots of different types of magical creatures... and it did! That was my favorite part of this book. Most of them I hadn't heard of before, and I'm not sure if they all exist in folklore somewhere or if the author made some up, but they were all interesting and had very cool characteristics. \n Unfortunately, the pacing of events was a little slow for me. Only towards the last half to last quarter of the book did I get the action that I was expecting - tracking down suspects, finding new Others. The first half was mainly spent with our main character while she wished that she wasn't an Other - which certainly is important to her, it just didn't grab me in as much as I wanted it to. \n The author does create a unique world, and I had to keep reminding myself that the 'humans' were aware that 'others' existed. I think it would be a lot of fun to read paranormal books based on dryads or some of the other creatures Kincy had playing main roles in her novel. \n Overall, Other was okay. The ending was quite good, though a few things solved too easily. If you're into paranormal and want to meet a few new characters, I think you'd really enjoy this book. \n Unrelated to the review, I was interviewing incoming freshmen at my job and had this book on the table and was scorned by one of them for reading Twilight. I explained that it wasn't Twilight, but I guess the cover gives off a Twilight-y feel to 18 year old males. There are vampires and werewolves, but it's not nearly the same, so it's best to not compare."}
{"text": "The Storybook of Legends was a pleasant little surprise. It was fun, imaginative, and a bit quirky. I wasn't a huge fan of the whole doll/merchandise tie-in, but putting that aside, I realized it was a fun, light children's novel. So, I had high hopes for the second book when it was released. Luckily, I wasn't disappointed. \n The Unfairest of Them All picks up right where Happily Ever After left off. All the students are in an uproar because Raven didn't sign the Storybook of Legends. This has caused the school to split into two groups - the Royals and the Rebels. Neither group wants to get along and refuses to back down - that is until a mutual friend is accused of committing a crime she didn't commit. \n Madeline Hatter - daughter of the famous Mad Hatter from Wonderland - finds herself accused of committing a crime that could lead her to be exiled and expelled from Ever After High. It is up to Apple and Raven to work together and go through a series of tasks to uncover the truth and save Madeline from exile. \n I absolutely loved and adored The Unfairest of Them All. It really took the characters that were introduced in Ever After High and developed them beyond imagination. Readers are shown that there is more to Apple - who appears shallow and superficial. Apple slowly starts to come around to the idea that change can - and sometimes is - a good thing. She still isn't ready to accept that Raven wants a different future, but she is slowly coming around to that idea. \n In addition to Apple's character development, Raven develops further. Readers get to see a closer look into Raven's relationship with her mother, and even get a sneak peek into life in the mysterious jail cell that The Evil Queen has been living in. \n One of the things that make this series so amazing is that every character, from the main characters of Apple and Raven to the smaller, secondary characters, has a unique personality that shines through the pages. Each character is distinctly their own person with unique likes/dislikes and interests, and Hale does an amazing job of developing them without drowning readers in boring blocks of text. \n Another aspect that really makes this series stand out is that there isn't a huge focus on love triangles/dating. It is mentioned throughout the book, but the main focus is on the characters, main plot, and just having a fun book to read. All too often 'tween' books tend to stray into the relationship zone and that is all it focuses upon. Luckily, that has not happened to this series. \n I did appriciate that Hale seemed to cut back on the cutesy language in this book. There was less 'Storybook-isms' in this novel, which made it a lot easier to read. It was one of my quirks in the first book, but it obviously has been toned down in this novel. \n I will admit I am looking forward to the next book in the series. It promises to take readers into Wonderland and out of all the characters and storylines in Ever After High - Madeline is my favorite. I really cannot wait to see where Hale takes this series. \n The truth is this - The Unfairest of Them All is not an epic fantasy. It isn't even a super involved children's novel. But, it is fun, light and has a solid enough plot that it will captivate most readers. It certainly is not a book for everyone. Many people will find it shallow, child-ish, and stereotypical, but if you love fairy tales or just want a fun, light read this is the book for you."}
{"text": "Re-read, July 5th, 2014 \n Just as good as I remembered. :) \n Originally read October 1, 2009 \n 9th&up. Sooooo good! I was deep into the story from the first page. Grace is a great character- her independence, her strength, her stubborn and loyal nature. Reading about her fascination with the yellow-eyed wolf who saved her life so long ago, the wolf who has watched her ever since had me totally absorbed. And what can I say about Sam? The boy who, for the love of Grace, fights his own nature so that he can stay with her. Stiefvater made him so irresistible- the way he protects and adores Grace, his intelligence and his love of poetry, the way he is the best of the pact, everything good about being human and a beautiful animal together. The ending! Wow! Stiefvater had me tearing through the pages until the last incredibly satisfying word. \n Sigh."}
{"text": "I sorta enjoyed this book. I think if it wasn't so dark and depressing I'd have liked it more. It felt like I was around a bunch of emo kids who can't see ANYTHING good in anything. \n I think the easiest way and least offensive way to do this review is just to list likes and then dislikes. \n Likes: \n I liked the cover. \n I liked that the book was based off of (very loosely) Little Red Riding Hood. \n Pearce really knows how to draw up misery, depression and just plain darkness. \n This book has an underlying sense of darkness and depression not recommended if you don't want to feel this way. \n Dislikes: \n Every so many pages readers were forced to reread another graphic description of Scarlett's scars. \n The book had a cynical look at anything that was normal. It was like it had to force the reader to be depressed. \n I couldn't really place myself in the girls' shoes. It was hard to be sympathetic of them when I just couldn't see how their lives were so miserable. I understood Scarlett but I couldn't get over the modern setting and then these girls living out in the country faking the modern world into believing they were ok. I just couldn't suspend reality or belief from this. \n I didn't really understand the point of the book. There are the werewolf like things and the girls go and hunt. But then at times the girls were like I HAVE to do this. But I didn't understand WHY they HAD to do it. \n Silias was as boring as a door nob. I knew from page one what was going to happen because it was very well lined out that that was what was going to happen."}

{"text": "I don't usually read fairy stories, and I will be honest, I didn't know what to expect from this one. The writing flowed smoothly and the description of the Fae world really took you to a different place. I was feeling a mixture of emotions as I read through it {in one sitting}.. I think it had everything; humor, love, betrayal, lust, good, evil, and everything in between. I will be looking for the next book in the series to be a wonderful trip through fantasy land just like this one is. \n I enjoyed all the characters, and really cared about their paths. I love the imagination of the fairy world, and the development of the courts. I would recommend this book, and already have, to people who like a little new adult in their fantasy. This is a clever and thoroughly entertaining book!"}

{"text": "Not sure if I like this book cover as much as the others but it's not the ugliest I've seen. This book was pretty funny, and sassy I will admit (I know Katy has been taken and being tortured, but after the fact). Also, I loved the fact that Katy is literally in Area 51. That's so awesome, pretty cool. Blake gets his fate and Katy does something that honestly, he deserves. The big fight for Daemon is to get Katy back and sure enough he does everything in his power, kills everyone within reach, and rest assured, does get to see Katy. Also, we get introduced to Archer, the mysterious guard that makes sure Katy doesn't leave her cell. Archer turns out to be pretty important to the plot so stay tuned to that. \n We get to finally see the Origins, and how they act and what exactly they are. They are creepy and scary and Katy is scared of them, like everyone should be. I HATE how petty Dee was being, the fact she seriously didn't try to save Katy, bitch move. Katy becomes ruthless in this novel and she really comes into her skin and realizes the stakes are high and there's no more time for games anymore. From the beginning of the book to the end, it was action packed and I found this book the best in the series by far. Obsidian was great for sure, but Origin really pulled my strings with the race to survive. \n We get to go into Las Vegas, and theres a huge battle, which was really awesome because I felt so exhausted after reading that whole scene just by how action-packed it was. We actually travel a lot in this book, first Area 51, then Las Vegas, and finally Idaho where I assume will be the setting for the last and final book, Opposition. I cant wait to see what Armentrout does with the last book and how she's going to wrap it up! \n IF you liked this review, check out more YA and other genre books on my blog! \n http://keepcalmandloveboooks.blogspot.ca"}
{"text": "I couldn't quite decide on whether to rate this a two or a three star and decided to round down since I can't imagine reading this again. \"Mirror Mirror\" is a retelling of Snow White that is just a little bit strange (like all of his books). There are several sly sexual innuendos in this book, not as blatantly obvious as in \"Wicked\" but still enough to make me vaguely uncomfortable as they always seem a bit sinister. Interesting enough idea, especially using actual historical figures, but definitely not a favorite for me."}
{"text": "Crosspost:http://thereadingbelle.com \n I've been dying to read Star-Touched Queen since last year. It was on my never-ending tbr pile. Also, it was one of the debut novels that I was most excited to read. Alright, many bloggers either love it or hate it. Where do I fall in this category? I felt this was an okay book, I couldn't completely love it nor hate it. \n The Star-Touched Queen had a lot of potential. First, it is loosely based on Indian mythology. It's one of the first YA books I've encountered that has Indian mythology. Also, it incorporates Greek mythology like the story of Hades and Persephone. Secondly, this story involves a curse. Who doesn't like a good story about curses? Maya's horoscope happens to be the most deadly. She has one of the worst horoscopes possible, and it doesn't help that her family ostracizes her. And lastly, the synopsis makes this book sound amazing. \n What went wrong? One of my biggest issues was the romance. I said it. Very insta-love. I would have preferred a slow built romance, or even better executed love-hate relationship. There are no love triangles if you're wondering. Thank God. Maya is instantly drawn to Amar. Amar rescues Maya from her home. He's introduced as the mysterious stranger coming from an unknown kingdom. Maya doesn't really question his motives and marries Amar. She leaves behind her old home, and lives in a mysterious kingdom. Maya constantly gets frustrated because Amar can't reveal everything to her. Even after finding out the backstory, I was still not a fan of their romance. Sure, they had many scenes together, but I didn't feel their chemistry. If the romance were more developed, I could have rated the book higher. \n I didn't particularly like Maya. Maya is shunned from the harem of women. Everyone sees her as bad luck. There is only one family member that loves Maya and that is her half-sister Gauri. I really felt sorry for Maya. She is a princess, and is treated unkindly. She has no mother, and absolutely no one to defend her. Most of the harem women want her dead. Maya has herself to rely on. Even her father doesn't pay much attention to her. The only time he acknowledges her presence is to force her into a political marriage. Maya has no freedom in her own home. I've noticed that Maya is very trusting of people. She doesn't immediately question a person's intentions, and because of her trust, it becomes her undoing. I did like her character development towards the second half of the book. Sadly, I would have liked a bigger redemption arc for me to like Maya. As for Amar, I liked him much more than Maya, but I did find him boring. He has the best quotes in this whole book: \n \"I love you,\" he murmured into my hair. \"You are my night and stars, the fate I would fix myself to in any life.\" \n I also liked how much he was shrouded in mystery. I didn't know what to expect from Amar. \n The plot didn't really move forwards till the second half of the book. The first portion of the book did drag out a bit. This is a story about reincarnation. I felt that there wasn't enough focus on the whole reincarnation aspect. It was glossed over. It would have been cool to know about Maya's previous lives. Especially how she and a certain someone grew up together...but that doesn't happen. \n What I liked was the writing style. Absolutely beautiful. \n \"Then what do you want form me?\" \n \"I want to lie beside you and know the weight of your dreams,\" he said, brushing his lips against my knuckles. \"I want to share whole worlds with you and write your name in the stars.\" He moved closer and a chorus of songbirds twittered silver melodies. \"I want to measure eternity with your laughter.\" Now, he stood inches from me; his rough hands encircled my waist. \"Be my queen and I promise you a life where you will never be bored. I promise you more power than a hundred kings. And I promise you that we will always be equals.\" \n The world building was just as great. And my favorite characters from this book were the horse and Gauri. Even though Gauri is hardly in the book, I like her relationship with Maya. I would have liked to have read more about their relationship. \n I know this is random, but Star-Touched Queen reminded me a lot of A Court Of Thorns and Roses. Is it just me? Both books didn't pick up till the second half. A redemption arc for both female protagonists. Tamlin and Amar were boring. There's a curse. The villain has a tragic backstory. (Minus the whole faerie courts, and Rhysand) \n Do I recommend this book? Not really. There are other books out there that are much better. I did like how unique it was. Also, there's a companion novel to this book which is very unnecessary. Will I be reading it? Not sure. I felt the story ended on a good note. \n Final Rating: [?][?][?]"}
{"text": "The only reason I finished this book was to find out if Leo was a human or merman. This question gets left unanswered. \n The story had potential, but the book drags on until he end when it rushed to finish. I didn't enjoy the pace of the story or how the plot unraveled. The plot was interesting, ,but clumsy. \n The characters were inconsistent, so I found I coldn't really relate to them. Miranda is only on Selkie Island for a week and she falls in love? She is supposed to be a science genious, but she thinks Leo might be half fish and randomly decides not to trust him when she sees the door to his house is red? \n I loved the folklore and Selkie Island tales and wished we learned more about it. Was there truth behind the tales? Maybe the idea was to keep the mystery behing it going. I can appreciate that, but I still believe more could have been done with the story."}
{"text": "So, I love the Mindjack Trilogy. I read it in its infancy and looked forward to each new book. \n Now, we get a little peek into the space between the books. In KEEPER, a novella, we get the origins of Kira's extraordinary speed and strength--reactions she is able to trigger by \"jacking\" or manipulating her own brain. \n Kira was able to \"jack\" herself to some extent in Open Minds and Closed Hearts, but for Free Souls she has the unique skill to trigger adrenaline release in her body enabling her to travel at superhuman speeds and act with superhuman strength. It's a valuable skill to have. \n Also, we get to see Julian, leader of the Jacker Freedom Alliance, up close and personal. It's clear that Kira struggles with her attraction to Julian--not sure if it's real or a memeory remnant from the time he jacked her mind. Well, I'm sure it's real; no man is so possessive of a woman without having some emotional bond to her. \n In KEEPER, Kira's obsessed with being on the strike force for the next JFA mission: attacking Kestrel's stronghold and rescuing trapped jackers from experiments and torture. Julian won't let her go knowing that Kira's secondary objective is to kill Kestrel--and it's clear Julian doesn't want Kira in harm's way. So, Kira develops her new talent in secret, hoping to make herself invaluable as a strike force member. \n It doesn't all go down so well, but maybe Julian will learn to relax.... Yeah. Right. \n KEEPER's a quick read and a little bite of Mindjack goodness for fans everywhere. Novellas are great for an at-lunch/pre-bed read, and this one will not disappoint."}
{"text": "This review was originally written for Joyfully Jay Reviews and can be accessed here: http://joyfullyjay.com/2015/08/review... \n Chris is a new college freshman unsure why he is even attending Creekville University. He didn't apply, but was offered a full scholarship. He's only on campus a day when he learns that his scholarship is dependent upon him working for Ethics professor, Dr. Faran. Oh, and Faran's research is based on the development of supernatural powers. And, Chris cannot talk about any of the research in Faran's laboratory to anyone not covered by Faran's magical contracts. Chris has no powers, though he'd like them. He makes a few friends, but is mostly intrigued by a senior student, Frederick, who also works with Faran. Frederick seemingly has no powers, but develops some--super strength, agility and speed--which are not particularly marketable or beneficial because they are so common. \n As the book moves forward, Frederick becomes more and more despondent regarding his lack of marketable skills. Through his confidences with Chris, we learn that Frederick's family has turned him out for his homosexuality, and his small southern community will not take him back. If Frederick cannot secure a job before graduation he'll become homeless. Chris continues to reach out to Frederick, but the emotional toll seems to be very great. Trigger warning--Frederick is VERY depressed and self-harm occurs. \n I think I didn't get the supernatural aspect from the blurb, but the book opened with a feat of telekinesis, so I got on board right away. The magical abilities the characters display are rooted in logic, not wizardry, which was refreshing. I liked Chris. He's a great kid. He knows he doesn't belong at Creekville and is appropriately worried about being discovered as a fraud. Not that he signed up to BE a fraud! He tries hard in his classes, but nothing seems to interest him until he makes contact with some psych majors and learns about their empathic abilities. Chris attempts his first steps of coming out, and finds many interested partners--even when he isn't looking, but his heart is set on Frederick. \n Chris so confused about Faran and the ulterior motives of this good-looking, charismatic man. It is through all of Chris' angst over Frederick's emotional state and depression that Chris actually decides upon his major--psychology--and seems to develop his ability, though he keeps all of the ability stuff to himself. This is protective for himself and Frederick, as Chris senses that Faran will likely exploit him if he knows. \n Unfortunately, the book ends mid-year, and it felt very unsettled. While there is some resolution, it's not a complete picture in comparison to the plot lines that had been woven. Chris desires Frederick as a boyfriend, and I hoped that Frederick would return his affection and clear interest, but not so much. He does take Chris up on an offer of friendship, and this is his only real lifeline. Chris was okay with being friends, hurt, but not overly so, which demonstrated a maturity I admired. There are a couple of physical scenes in the book, but the steam factor is pretty low. Honestly, this is not a romance; it's a coming of age, coming out, coming into powers story, but not a romance. That said, I did like this supernatural world and also the characters, primary and secondary. I'm intrigued enough to want the sequel. \n A review copy of this book was provided by Dreamspinner Press."}
{"text": "Oh man, I think I chewed a hole through my lip. This. Book. Was. HOT! I am just sorry that I didn't read this sooner. Nulli Para Ora has delivered an exceptional and unique paranormal romance that will grip the reader in from start to finish. Nulli also has a an excellent talent for stringing together a charming narration and dialogue amongst the characters; capturing a readers heart. \n The characters and their development and the relationships that form between each other are certainly remarkable. \n Ashland for example is the brilliant and feisty female protagonist that I am always wishing to find in a good read. She's the black sheep in her village of Minra, a place where people practically throw themselves at the opportunity to be an initiate--royal companions who feed their energy to their cursed King-- I admire her for her compassion and capacity to stand up and fight for what she believes in. \n Ashland is in for a surprise once she gets to know the king and everything behind the truth of his curse and the reasoning's on the technique to sustain himself to rule their land Not only that, but his motives to better their land. She learns to respect the king. But what will become of this trust? We come to a shocking end, but a satisfied one at that. \n Then we have sexy Cirian, who is the mysterious Ritual Master -basically the kings second hand man--who is the one to have chosen Ashland as one of the initiates. After being loyal to the king for so many years, his heart is finally at risk for falling for the brave Ashland. And he wants her as his own. Will he be willing to risk his high rank in the Kings order for the claim of this woman? \n Though, Cirian and Ashland did not get along with each other at all in the beginning. I absolutely love a relationship that starts off in rough patch, and at the risk of sounding like the hopeless romantic most of you know I can be.........such hardships show that love can concur all! I love watching characters grow and learning to fall into the arms of the one they are destined to be with. \n I also appreciated the beautifully written naughty scenes. They were not vulgar in any form. The sexy scenes, I felt, were poetic while still managing that steamy angst we all desire between two appealing characters. \n The author captures everything a story needs and more in such a tight capacity in the form of a novella. I was astonished! There are no loose ends, so this book will not leave you questioning anything other than, \"Oh my Gods, can we please have more Cirian?\""}

It picks up where where My Lady Mage left off; the five Warriors of the Mist had concocted a plan in the hope of defeating Duke Keirthan and putting an end to his tyrannical rule aided by blood magic, thus fulfilling their quest. \n Her Knight's Quest begins with setting Gideon's plan in motion. According to the plan, Gideon and Murdoch are to stay with Lady Merewen and guard her keep from further attacks, while Duncan would pretend to be scholar seeking work as a scribe in the abbey to be able to gather information to defeat the Duke, and finally, Kane and Averel would travel to the city and seek work in the Duke's palace. Keirthan would be quite interested in having a man like Kane who bears a dark mark on his face. \n The first ten chapters in Her Knight's Quest shift between Gideon, the other warriors and Lady Merewen and events taking place at her keep, on the one hand and Duncan and Lady Lavinia, on the other. \n Starting chapter 11, however, the novel takes the reader to a new dimension in the story; Duke Keirthan. We are introduced to the Duke - whom we briefly met in My Lady Mage - and his history. The present Duke of Agathia is Ifre Keirthan, who, it seems, usurped the dukedom from his brother Armel. \n Chapter 11 solves many questions that come to the reader's mind over previous 10 chapters. It also solves the other characters' frustrations and questions they voice. As dark and bloody as Ifre Keirthan is, many events come to light in this chapter, which has a climactic feel to it. \n After chapter 11, the story continues to shift but not between two parties, but three, as Duke Keirthan becomes more involved in the story. Starting chapter 11, it is almost impossible to put the book down. The reader feels that all chapters are of extreme importance. \n Alexis Morgan's tension build-up picks up pace. More mysteries are answered in chapters 13 and 14. Duncan and Lavinia reveal things about themselves that set the story in motion and that link different characters and parts of the story together. Starting chapter 11, momentum builds up and there is no stopping it till the end of the book. \n Her Knight's Quest differs from its predecessor, My Lady Mage, in that there is a lot going on everywhere with each of the characters; there are events taking place at Merewen's keep, at the abbey, and with Duke Keirathan. We also learn about the Duke's past, his rise to power or rather usurpation of the dukedom, and about magic, the duke's dark blood magic and Lavinia's pure earth magic. \n Despite the constant rise in tension, Morgan employs occasional short romantic scenes and some humour. A single humourous line easily breaks the reader's tension, giving them a bit of relief. \n As with My Lady Mage, Alexis Morgan ends her novel on a high note of anticipation. The reader feels as though they need to read all three parts consecutively without halt or pause. \n The second instalment in the Warriors of the Mist series earns a 4.5-star review (from me). It goes without saying that I can hardly wait for the Honor's Price, the third instalment in the series."}
{"text": "I quite liked this one, and I'm excited to see where the author takes the characters in the following books. I have a feeling each book is just going to get better."}
{"text": "Perhaps not as whiz bang as the first book in the trilogy, Before They Are Hanged was still a good read. As with any trilogy, this book was more about the getting from point A (book 1) to point B (book 3, presumably, where there is resolution), full of nice bits of action and the building up of tension for the third book."}
{"text": "Enjoyed book two, though it could probably have been a hundred or three pages lighter. If you get to book two, pay attention to the vignettes between parts - they all come back at some point to be relevant again. If you sloughed though book one, you should keep reading book two, Sanderson does a decent job of keeping the story going. My only complaint was I felt like there was a little too much foreshadowing/obvious outcomes. Then again, this is Sanderson, so book three will probably turn all of that over on its head and prove everything we thought we knew was wrong."}
{"text": "Sienna and Hawke are my favorites, closely followed by Sasha and Lucas!"}
{"text": "Well, where to start?? How about I'm straight forward by saying how it's and what I felt while reading this book. \n First, I was like super excited to start it. The cover, the blurb, just everything lured me in. Yup, I kept my evening free so I can dive into this book. Don't get me wrong, I didn't jump in with any expectations, I just dove in. I like to go in a book blind, especially if it's from my own tbr and not for a blog tour. So yeah here I am, ready to meet KING.... \n After reading half the book I was hella confused and was like \"Did I miss something?\" I didn't rush the book, I took my time but I realized the book just missed from everything a lil bit. The beginning was veeery slow and I was edgy to get to the 'fun' part. So when I finished the book I was still very much C.O.N.F.U.S.E.D. - because nothing was solved or very much explained! \n Yup, I felt as I was walking the whole time through a dark tunnel, no lights, no orientation, just nothing. I finished this book and my first reaction was what the heck was that. \n Did I know who or what KING was? Nope ...he was still a secrete and mystery to me and Mia. I don't like that. Of course I was hella curious and what did I do?? Yup, you might guessed right, I ordered book 2 right away. \n Now you might ask yourself why I did this; afterall,as stated earlier the story had some wholes or could have been stronger developed for my taste. But the author made me BEYOND curious and I badly wanna know who this guy is; what's his agenda' and what key-role does the Mia, the h play in all this. \n That's why I bought it. And it's often that the second book in a trilogy is better because the 1st book is most likely a broader introduction for the characters, setting etc. So indeed, I gave this author the benefit of the doubt and spent $3.99 for book 2. \n Ok, I've to admit the H is more to my liking than the h; she's somewhat annoying and has a serious problem following orders or listen to someone who has more knowledge/experience and could safe her life. But no, miss smarty-pants knows always better - yeah she's a bit annoying. Her inner monologue wasn't the hit and I had some serious eye-rolling going on. And she had some bitch-cake to eat while being around KING; I'm surprised he didn't choke her... \n The side-characters are great, and fit well in the picture. \n Oh, one more thing; there's zero romance going on. Just that you know. There's LOTS of sexual tensions and many 'almosts' but no actual romance. Which didn't bother me one bit but I know many it'll; I'm in for the Urban Fantasy/PNR aspect :) \n So yeah even though it wasn't a 4 or 5 star read for me the author intrigued me and I even finished book 2 last night...and I'm still curious but a bit smarter ;) \n ___________________________________ \n Read all my review (A-Z) on the blog \n Like the blog on Facebook"}
{"text": "3.5Stars \n I like the book and story line, but it lacked on action and spark. I know it's a series and I can only assume that the second book will be better. The last 20% were great and I was like Yeah finally some action but that excitement didn't last long. The 'fun' was over fast and I was like o.O ! I wished for more depths and development,and scenes that really hooked me and made me anxious,but this wasn't the case :( \n I understand Ms Espinoza created with Binds a solid base for her series but the spark were missing which I need in a paranomal/fantasy book. \n I liked the characters, especially Phee. I was as disappointed as she when she found out the truth about Reece and was very thrilled when she kicked her husbands ass! \n Overall, the book was a good read and many parts made me chuckle and yeah I'll def read the second book because of the last 20 percent and most def the epilogue which made me want to find out more!! Binds covered the general basis of the book, who is connected with who,etc. - in my opinion. \n I've hope that the second book will rock, especially after reading Spencer's inner dialogue ;)"}

{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n UUUGGHHHHHHH. Commence prolonged mourning period. After reading this book I definitely realized I will have to go back at some point and reread this series because I ended up missing a lot in my haste to get to the end and find out what happens. I thought this book had a great amount of action for a second book and it had its own plot that I really really enjoyed--no second book syndrome at all! Can I just say that I felt really bad for Mare during this book? I felt like everyone was being so unfair and cruel to her. Throughout the book I really empathized with her and I didn't think that anything she did was as bad as anyone made it out to be? She was a little power hungry but I felt that after everything she went through in book one she had a right to want to feel powerful and in control of her life. And yeah, she didn't trust anyone but if I went through what she went through, I wouldn't either! I honestly hated Farley at the end of this book I couldn't believe she would act that way to Mare when it was her own brother who died. When Shade died I felt a knife go through my back as well. I had to pause and take deep breaths. He was the only person besides Mare that I trusted throughout this entire book, so of course he had to die. I was living for the sweet moments between Mare and Cal, they made me so happy. I just wished there would have been a lot more of them! This series is super light on romance, to the point that we don't even get any makeout scenes between the characters, only quick kisses and thigh rubbing, which is great, but I need more. I guess it's probably a lot more realistic given that they're in a life or death situation and that's probably the last thing they're thinking about, but come on, we don't read these types of books because they're realistic. When I read Red Queen, I had a gut feeling that Maven was going to betray her, so that book didn't have as big of a plot twist for me, but I completely did not see this ending coming. It seemed so plausible that they would to the war for the last book I could see it playing out in my head already so I was SHOCKED. I have no idea now how the next book will play out at all but desperately need it in my life."}
{"text": "9th&up. Wow! I mean, I can't believe that....yeah, and then when Stevie Ray....and Heath, when he....and the visions....and the ending....and holy crap!.... \n I would give it an extra star, but some of the teenage conversation got on my nerves a bit, and the love-pentagram got a little old (one true love, girl! Try it sometime!) But a really entertaining read and I can't wait for more!"}

{"text": "Unchosen is Book Two of The Reaper Diaries trilogy. I'm assuming that it was rushed to market because of the many spelling and grammatical errors that interfere with the enjoyment of the story. My favorite parts were the quotes from Molly's diary and from the Secret History of Reapers and from various other \"sources\". The rest of the book tended to be overly tween in language and tone. Despite the limitations of Book Two, I went to Amazon in search of Book Three. I do hate to leave a story unfinished. According to the blurb at the end of this volume, Book Three was due to be released on March 25, 2014. However, it doesn't seem to exist yet. Maybe it is still being proof-read. One can only hope."}

{"text": "This is a well written book!!! I loved the Vampire Academy books!!! The reason I only gave this book 3 stars...is due to the fact that I could not make a connection with the main characters. The Alchemists have a great ability...but their feelings coming through this book about vampires...really dampened my ability to make a connection with Sydney. I have always had a fondness for vampires and weres...so their disgust for them made it hard to read the book. I hoped with each turned page...I would fall in love with the book...but it didn't. The plot has a lot of great twists and turns...but I'm sorry...it's not a book series for me."}
{"text": "I picked up this book knowing nothing about it because I liked the premise, and I liked the first page, and I liked the coat. It reminded me of the door in Howl's Moving Castle, and the cape, and was generally Diana Wynne Jonesesque. The beginning was a bit slow, and it took me a while to get into it, but while the pacing was off I liked the tone of the book. I think maybe I didn't find it as funny or amusing as other people did, and as it was trying to be, but the tone of the prose was very self-aware and tongue-in-cheek, a rare quality for fantasy books which I particularly appreciate. Again, very Diana Wynne Jones. The city descriptions were incredibly Ghibli-esque - I especially liked the very vivid yet fairy-tale-esque descriptions of markets by colour, smell, taste, etc. It reminded me a bit of Spirited Away. \n I found the plot to be rather predictable, and the section titles giving away upcoming content were infuriating, but altogether I'm intrigued enough by the world to want to revisit it, so I'll be reading the sequel."}
{"text": "When I first saw Ninja Librarians in the library, I was a bit unsure how this book would be received. It seemed to take a whole bunch of random stuff and pack it into one book. It claimed to have adventure, mystery, time-traveling, ninjas/fighting, libraries, and lots and lots of books. There was a lot that could go wrong with this book, so I approached it cautiously. \n After reading it, all I can say is - I was wrong. Ninja Librarians is a fun, adventurous children's novel that is unique, fast-paced and designed for readers of all ages. At just under 400 pages, this novel creates a truly unique world, takes readers on an adventure, and leaves the door open for more adventure and fun! \n The basics of the plot for this first book of the series is that two youngsters - Dorrie and Marcus - fall through a portal of sorts. The portal, which is located in the closest of their local library, takes them to a mysterious labyrinth that is made up of dozens of different libraries. Only these libraries are connected to different parts of the word and different times. \n The labyrinth, which is known as Petrarch's Library, is actually a secret headquarters of sorts for librarians who are fighting to protect the rights of others who have gotten in trouble for what they wrote/penned. Librarians aren't the people that you see behind the desk. These librarians are trained fighters who are quick on their feet and ready to fight. \n The Accidental Keyhand follows Dorrie and Marcus as they learn more about Petrarch's Library and fight to earn a place in the highly secretive society. Unfortunately, there is an evil counter organization out there that would like nothing more than to see Petrarch's Library and all those associated with it taken down. Dorrie and Marcus must work to clear their name and prove they are not a part of this society before it is too late. \n There is so much to like about The Accidental Keyhand - the strong, fast-paced nature of the writing, the unique world that is created, and the likeable characters. It is almost impossible to know where to start. \n Jen Swann Downey does an amazing job of crafting a story that moves at an extremely fast-pace, but that doesn't seem to brush over tiny details. While reading, I was able to acquaint myself with the world, learn about the characters, and get a whole backstory to the main story, without feeling like I was being bogged down with endless details or unimportant information. In fact, the whole story seemed to just fly right by and before I knew it - the book was over. \n The world of Petrarch's Library did take some time to get used to. I was afraid it wouldn't work, but something 'clicked' halfway through and I found it intriguing. I've seen some people compare the world to Harry Potter and that feeling they got when reading that series. I'm not sure I'd go that far, but there is a certain magical, unique feel to Petrarch's Library that makes the entire novel feel special. \n One of the amazing things about The Accidental Keyhand is that I really feel it appeals to both children and adults. Yes, for all intense and purposes it is a children's fantasy novel, but it really has a gripping, page-turning quality to it that will make adults like it. Adults will certainly like the way favorite books/literary characters are weaved into the novel without seeming forced. \n Overall, The Accidental Keyhand is a truly amazing, fun read. In fact, I almost wish I could become a Ninja Librarian - but I won't be asked! I anxiously await the next book in this series and until then, you'll be able to find me looking for an entrance to Petrarch's Library!"}
{"text": "Ho letto con crescente sorpresa questo libro, che ha l'indubbia dote di scorrere piacevolmente. \n La trama e avvincente anche se non eccessivamente complessa (il che, a mio parere, e un merito - trovo stucchevole la ricerca del colpo di scena a tutti i costi); il protagonista e personaggio credibile, affascinante e pieno di sfaccettature. \n La scrittura di Duncan e lineare; il racconto e pieno di riferimenti all'attualita ed e perfettamente calato nel presente. \n E' una lettura assolutamente non 'impegnata', ma non per questo meno gradevole. \n Consigliato per un pomeriggio davanti al camino."}
{"text": "I'll be completely honest when I say that I might be a tad biased because I love beauty and the beast so much. This story gave the story I love a bit of a twist. Enchanted books should have definitely been apart of the original story. The message the author sends that every person should write their own story is powerful. Sometimes the grass isn't greener on the other side and that we have all that we need right where we are, we just have to take a step back to look and appreciate it. Loved this story."}
{"text": "Meet Celaena Sardothien, Adarlan's most notorious assassin. After a year of imprisonment and slavery in the high guarded and cruel Salt Mines of Endovier, the girl with the unpronounceable name (at least, it took me a time to make something of it) gets escorted out by the Captain of the Royal Guard, Chaol Westfall. She is to meet the Crown Prince of Adarlan, Dorian, who wants to take her back to the glass castle of Rifthold where she is win a competition to become the King's Champion. \n \"And how old are you?\" \n \"Eighteen.\" But Chaol said nothing. \"I know,\" she continued. \"It is impressive that I accomplished so much at such an early age.\" \n I fell in love with Celaena from the start. Already in chapter one she was a complete bad-ass. She knew how strong and awesome she was, and had no problem expressing it. Further in the book I only started loving her more. Even though she's been trough the hardest year ever, she does not pity herself and remains to live with pride. \n \"I hate women like that. They're so desperate for the attention of men that they'd willingly betray and harm members of their own sex. And we claim men cannot think with their brains! At least men are direct about it.\" \n Even though I haven't been a fan of love triangles lately (it's getting a bit old), I liked this one. I loved both of the men Celaena started felling for and I can't say I'm really team-anybody. If it's up to me, I would happy with either of them. \n \"We all bear scars, Dorain. Mine just happen to be more visible than most.\" \n Also, at one point this book to a complete different turn than I expected. I thought it was just gonna be about the competition, but it became way more than that. And I loved it from the start. The story just became that much more exciting. \n In conclusion, I absolute adored this book. It was an easy read, but also an absolutely awesome read. I can't wait to start Crown of Midnight and Heir of Fire, and I have no doubt in my mind that I will finish this trilogy this year."}
{"text": "I'm not a fan of Pierce's \"Circle\" books, for all that I rabidly adore all things Alanna/Keladry/Numair. I did love Will of the Empress, so I thought I'd try Melting Stones. Not Tammy's strongest book, not by a long shot, but I wonder if I'd feel differently hearing the audio version, which was its original form. Read this if you're a Pierce fan, but don't let it be the first (or second, or third) Pierce book you read."}
{"text": "5 STAR rating even with editing issues! It was, seriously, a puzzle where each answer brought about a new piece to question. And we're left with the biggest cliffhanger and me, speechless on how to describe how I feel about it all. \n I adore Lon and Cady together. I am enamored by the love she has for Jupe. The one thing about Cady's discoveries in these books that gets me is that she always needs to protect those she cares for, whether they are and the right side of the law or not. Each character that she connects with is completely redeemable and she shows you their shiny sides right along with their disfigurements."}

{"text": "A beautiful story. Neil Gaiman is truly a unique storyteller. I did a combo of reading and listening to this story, and Neil is great at reading as well. I got interested in this book after seeing the movie, which I really enjoyed. The book is similar - maybe a bit more poetic - but I think the plot in the movie is a bit improved (not much, but a bit). \n I imagine this book came about because Neil read the below poem that he includes in the beginning, and then he invented a plot around it. The result is the book reads like a epic poem - it's creative, magical, and really, just right. \n Go and catch a falling star, \n Get with child a mandrake root, \n Tell me where all past years are, \n Or who cleft the devil's foot, \n Teach me to hear mermaids singing, \n Or to keep off envy's stinging, \n And find \n What wind \n Serves to advance an honest mind. \n If thou be'st born to strange sights, \n Things invisible to see, \n Ride ten thousand days and nights, \n Till age snow white hairs on thee, \n Thou, when thou return'st, wilt tell me, \n All strange wonders that befell thee, \n And swear, \n No where \n Lives a woman true, and fair. \n If thou find'st one, let me know, \n Such a pilgrimage were sweet; \n Yet do not, I would not go, \n Though at next door we might meet; \n Though she were true, when you met her, \n And last, till you write your letter, \n Yet she \n Will be \n False, ere I come, to two, or three. \n And here is my new favorite quote: \"Have been unavoidably detained by the world.

{"text": "audiobook narrated by James Langton \n Fool's Errand takes place years after the events of Robin Hobb's Farseer trilogy and does not disappoint. The story is as well written as Hobb's previous works and is great from beginning to end. The story kind of fills the gap between the trilogies and explains in greater detail the events concluding the Farseer trilogy while also building into this new adventure. \n The story is kind of broken into a summation of past events and then embarking on something new. The summation works great as a device to those of us who read the Farseer trilogy to remind us where things left off and gives some greater closure to the events concluding that trilogy. The summation would also work well for those new to the Farseers to introduce the world and explain a bit of the back story that defines FitzChivalry's motives. That said, if you haven't read the Farseer trilogy and don't like spoilers, definitely read that trilogy before Tawny Man. \n Robin Hobb's writing flows so well that even seemingly mundane tasks and everyday things are a joy to experience. She really knows how to make you care about the characters and builds a plot that pushes those characters. There are some truly great and terrible moments in this book that I just can't say without ruining so much of the story. There were a few times that I didn't think things made total sense but the story is just so enjoyable it really didn't matter. \n On the audio side of things, James Langton did a great job. It was really hard going from Paul Boehmer's performance in the Farseer Trilogy to James Langton in this trilogy. I loved Boehmer's performance and his voice became the characters' voices to me. Even though it was jarring at first, Langton's voices and narration became natural to my ear after only a few hours. He does a great job doing voices that fit the different characters and his sulky/sullen cat voice has to be one of the most fitting voices I could imagine. Some of his pronunciations threw me a bit too but overall I enjoyed his performance. \n Everything together makes a story that really takes you places. By the end of this story you'll be back in the intrigue of the court at Buckkeep and want to go on to Golden Fool."}
{"text": "I always enjoy Stephen King's short fiction, and this collection doesn't disappoint. \n No, it's not perfect: some of the stories are gimmicky and some endings feel forced. But there are more than a few terrific ones in here (\"Blockade Billy,\" \"A Death,\" \"Ur,\" \"Obits,\" and \"Summer Thunder\" are stand-outs), and they're all 100% King stories. \n King introduces each story with a bit of background or inspiration. Although it was interesting to read (I always enjoy reading about King's writing process), I'd have preferred to get them after the stories and have gotten the stories straight, or 'pure' without the context first. If any other readers sense that they'd feel the same, I'd recommend skipping the intros and then going back to them later."}
{"text": "Interesting book. Very, very creative. The prose is a bit difficult at times to wade through (translated from the original language) and the story lagged in places, but it's far more expansive, ripe with mythological roots, and symbolism-heavy than the 80's film!"}
{"text": "One of the best editions in the Song of Ice and Fire series so far. The additions of Sam Tarly and Jaime Lannister are riveting, but Tyrion is definitely the most interesting read, detailing the court intrigues at King's Landing. Daenerys' chapters are equally impressive, detailing her conquest of the cities of Slaver's Bay with her army of Unsullied. At the wall, the chapters detailing the willing attack and Jon's election as Lord Commander are an interesting diversion from the War of Five Kings. The only issue I had was with the Bran and Arya chapters, which were somewhat slow compared to the pace of the rest of the book."}
{"text": "Technopath Hogarth Dawson has failed to become one of the Power Alliance--more than once. Like many in this world, his super powers are limited. He is able to kitbash, which means he can control technology and transform machines into weapons. Kinda handy, except when he's being mugged in an alley and requiring rescue from the Viking-like Memphis Rook. \n Rook was a member of the Power Alliance, until he failed to save one human in a rescue. Now he's an unlicensed hero risking his freedom every time he goes in for a rescue. And, he does this often because, well, a hero saves people even if they aren't sanctioned to do so. \n The book is a super fast read with dry humor sprinkled throughout. Garth, as Rook calls him, is a snarky narrator, and I often chuckled aloud. \n So there I was, carrying his brawny elephant carcass up the stairwell of my walk-up and regretting I lived on the third floor. I wondered what his fellow heroes could have possibly fed him in the Alliance. Double-decker buses came to mind. Not only that, when I say he was hot, I didn't mean good looking. Granted, Rook was not exactly a homely fellow, but I meant he was burning the hell up. \n Rook and Garth team up trying to save the world, and be with each other, only to get into more trouble. Turns out leader of the Power Alliance, Captain Chivalry, has a history with Garth, and needs his kitbashing power to save someone close to him. Will Garth helping his ex-lover cause Rook to turn away? Or, will Chivalry turn out to be the opposite of his name? \n The book had me laughing. The smexytimes were short and sweet, just like the story. I look forward to the next in the series."}

I confirmed to myself that it was the book itself and not just me being slumpy, because I had to put it down about half way through to read something else and I devoured it. I just feel really strongly that this book did nothing for the series. I obviously haven't continued on with the third book yet, but I feel like this series would have been better as a duology. \n It was such a disappointment for me because I loved the first book so much, but this was a major second book slump. I love the characters and the world, but I just could not find it in me to care about the plot in this installment. I really really wanted to, there was just nothing for me to latch onto. \n I still want to finish up this series and give it one more chance, because I think it deserves that, but I plan on waiting a little while before I continue on to try and un-slump myself."}

{"text": "8th&up. So, I realize that lots of people really liked this book, and I wanted to be a fan as well. It just didn't work for me though. I found Miranda to be too superior and unlikable, and every time I would think that she was growing up and changing for the better, something else would happen. Not even major things, just something the author would make her think, or say or do, and I would be back to seeing her as an immature brat that thinks a bit too much of herself. \n I could have gotten over that if the book hadn't just sort of faded away at the end. I realize that the author intends on writing more about the main characters, but it wasn't as if the book was left with a cliffhanger that made you yearn for the next volume. It was more like the author forgot to deal with all the issues that she had introduced. I was just left with a feeling that the book was unfinished, or the author was in a rush to hand the book to the publisher. I'm not sure I care to read more."}
{"text": "Even better than the first one. \n I was surprised, as the book was very action packed, with unexpected turns and kept me on my toes. \n The love story is still annoying and unrealistic though, as Emma seems like an uni-dimensional character and lacks a serious character development. She's quite a Mary-Sue-ish portrayal of the pretty love interest with no flaws and with a hint of inner turmoil caused by the protagonist. It sure took them an awful short time to fall in love with each other. \n Totally love Brenwyn and Addison though."}

This was a lovely book, and it truly did wrap up nicely the chapter of Larten Crepsley's life that you were wont to wonder about if you'd only ever read the TVA books. Glad I made the decision to read this series."}
{"text": "I received this book for free from Goodreads First Reads, and I am incredibly grateful to have had the opportunity to read it. Jessica Shirvington is a knowledgeable author with an amazing ability to weave stories. Enticed is even better than its predecessor, which says a lot about its quality. This book is unique in that it has an artful balance of romance and action while thoroughly building the characters. They are realistic and believable which leads to excellent relationships. Interactions between characters, especially Violet and Lincoln, will have you holding your breath in anticipation. The pacing of the story is impeccable because it maintains a decent amount of suspense without drawing the events out. It is often difficult to find any truly original novels, but Enticed offers a unique and fresh story. This is an excellent read and is unrivalled by any other in its genre. I cannot wait to get my hands on the next installment of the series!"}

I like this book a lot better the second time around, and I'm about to start reading the rest of the trilogy for the first time. \n I'm not sure what I think of the device that gives away what I would have expected as the plot of the trilogy in the first pages -- this is obviously not a spoiler, so: Tobin clearly does successfully take the throne, which ought to be shifting the focus from \"what happens\" to \"how do people feel about the way it happens\", but I still feel like the pacing of the story is very conventional and driven by the tension of whether Tobin can be positioned for the coup.... \n Brilliantly creepy, though. It will be interesting to see how the question of Tobin's sexuality is handled in the next book!"}
{"text": "In the same vein as An Ordinary Princess and Ella Enchanted. Very middle-grade, very well done."}
{"text": "I suppose that technically speaking this is a young adult book. At least, the main characters are teenagers. Our heroine, Mori, tells her story in the form of a diary. It seems to begin in the middle of a trauma that she is recovering from and clues slowly are revealed to add more pieces to the puzzle. Fifteen year old Mori has run away from her insane witch mother and been placed under the guardianship of a father whom she has never met before. Dad lives with his three half sisters in England. Mori has lived her entire life in Wales. She is now sent to a snooty boarding school where she is definitely a stranger in a strange land. As she has for her entire life, Mori takes comfort in books. Hundreds of books. Most of them are science fiction or fantasy. And Mori seems to spend over half of her diary listing and reviewing these books. Jo Walton has obviously read extensively in both genres. This is the second novel I have read by this author. I probably won't read any more. If you can plow through to the ending, it is a satisfying one. But it is a tedious journey to get there."}

{"text": "Brielle Matthews has learned seeing the handiwork of God's creation can be a bit overwhelming. \n BROKEN WINGS, the second in the Angel Eyes trilogy by Shannon Dittemore, returns Brielle to the role of heroine. (See my review of ANGEL EYES here) \n Picking up six months after ANGEL EYES, Brielle, Kaylee and Jake have just graduated high school. Stratus is celebrating the opening of a new community center, spearheaded by Kaylee and funded by Olivia Hart's foundation. \n Brielle knows something isn't right about Olivia--Canaan's halo burns hot whenever she comes near, but Brielle's even more unsettled by her father's behavior. Seems Olivia brings out the alcoholic in her dad. \n Coupled with her Celestial vision--Brielle observes Angels and Demons within the human realm--she is being haunted by dreams of her mother's demise. Learning that her mother's coffin was buried empty is a shock of the first order. Could she still be alive? \n And why are Angels circling her home? \n Meanwhile, Brielle is affected by the tar-like fear rolling off everyone she meets. It is only in worship and prayer that she sees the fear disintegrate. So why is Jake--the most devout person Brielle knows--sweating fear? \n Jake's love for Brielle shines through his steadfast gaze, yet she is stunned by his fear. They are meant for each other--God himself gave Jake an engagement ring for her--so, what is he hiding? \n In the Celestial realm, Damien has met with Lucifer and revealed his knowledge of Jake and Brielle's gifts. He is able to garner Lucifer's interest and secure instructions to collect them in two week's time. Damien uses Olivia to not only capture Jake and Brielle, but also Canaan's halo. \n See, Lucifer is planning a battle, and Stratus has become Ground Zero. \n Despite the bond between Jake and Brielle, doubt remains. Jake's risky mission to discover his parentage separates them at the absolute WORST time. And, when he doesn't return, Brielle's fledgling faith is put to the test. \n Again, Shannon Dittemore has spun a beautifully crafted story of love, faith, doubt and keeping our demons at bay. For those who enjoy paranormal fiction, BROKEN WINGS is a fantastic tale. Contemporary themes and realistic emotional content keep this story grounded firmly in the Terrestrial, with eyes to the skies and hope for a safe resolution."}

{"text": "Part of Love is Always Write - Volume 1 \n I don't usually read shifter stories so was surprised to find I quite liked this story. In some respects the shifter element was not important, it was just a story about a man making choices based on what was expected of him - mate with someone approved by his family and have children, don't be gay or choose outside of race. It also tells the story of living with a broken heart but eventually following your heart to find happiness. \n For a short story it packs a lot in - meet, hot sex, heartbreak, lonely years, follow the heart, more hot sex, fall in love, family backlash, rescue, happy ending."}
{"text": "At first I wasn't sure if I would like it, simply because it read from first person to like 3rd in the same paragraph/dialect, it was a bit annoying, but then as I continued it got better and I didn't notice it anymore and the story really picked up.

{"text": "The Eyre Affair should be classified as mystery/adventure/fantasy. It acts like steampunk except that the characters (some of them at least) can be anywhere in time including the distant future rather than just in the Victorian/Edwardian ages. I found the first half of the book confusing. We were in London, weren't we? But not exactly the London I have seen/experienced. Things happened but I wasn't getting a sense of where we might be going. By the second half of the book, I had learned enough of the fictitious ethos/terrain that I got it and found it very entertaining. \n The Eyre Affair relates to an English society in literature is very important. The person on the street can quote Shakespeare the way in modern society people sing popular songs. But something nefarious is underway: the snatching of original manuscripts and counterfitting new plots. Terrible! And worth sending out government agents to stop, before the public revolts. \n Fascinating. Worth reading."}

Evil is afoot and Liz and her new friends (and possible boyfriend?) must discover who is stealing artifacts before they get blamed, or before tragedy befalls them."}

At first, I felt like I was reading a fairytale like Sleeping Beauty.Then we are put into Robyn's world at the age of seventeen where she had been told, as a young child, that her future has been predestined to marry when she completed school. She saw this as an honor and dreamed of her McKale for years and years. On her way to meet McKale , her parents tell her more details about her impending binding that crush her dreams. Her reality may be askew from what she had imagined, yet the real McKale might be better than she ever thought. \n Truly a fresh perspective and unique story. Wendy Higgins has a way of writing that colors the mood and spins a tale that isn't exactly predictable."}
{"text": "needed to be longer and more fleshed out. for a $3 ebook, it deserves at least a 3 star rating but after reading the author's books, I really wanted more."}
{"text": "This is a book of short stories. Interesting subject matter where children are the main characters but left me unsettled after reading."}
{"text": "I was pretty happy with this book in general as it was a fun read and fairly engaging. It did remind me of another book series from another author but only in the comedic sense. The characters were all real defined and interesting and in some ways the support characters were stronger and more memorable than the main character. \n Main character Gerald Dunwoody is a wizard of the 3rd level and seemingly incapable of any real magic or holding a job. He tramples through life until he answers an ad for a court wizard out of necessity. Desperate for work, he forgets to ask the important questions and accepts the position out of hand not realizing his life was about to change forever. Accompanied by his companion Reg, a female talking bird with a history and support from his genius wizard friend Monk Markham, Gerald finds himself in a political situation like no other. \n Karen Miller writing as K.E. Mills does a good job of creating a believable world and comical but yet serious situation to create her series in that keeps the readers nose in the book and wondering what is coming next. With a limited setting, Miller does what most authors don't which is to tell a real story about characters, growth and companionship. My only real complaints are the lack any real sense of time period and a twist that seemed fore shadowed but led a different direction. It's hard to imagine what the world looks like except for a couple points in the book in which Miller gets a bit more detailed. \n All in all it is a good book with solid character development and a story that compels you to keep reading to find out what happens. A solid 3 1/2 stars out of 5 for me as it is a light read. It is definitely worth the read and following up with the other books in the series."}

{"text": "Reading this book was so infuriating. There are spoilers ahead so anyone interested in reading the book should stop now. As many people mentioned Toby is damn annoying, she sucks at being investigator of any kind. She makes so many mistakes, and she drives me crazy (you got angry when you learned HE TRIED TO SEDUCE YOU WITH MAGIC, killing people wasn't enough? She got angry when it got personal? I.. I'm just speechless). The thing is, she had potential, and it's sad to see it wasted, completely. I wasn't that into first book but it was okay, I thought it will get better. No, it didn't. I already read few reviews of following volumes and it's supposed to get better so I will try reading next few ones but this book was a serious blow to the series. There's something not letting me just throw it away and forget though. I dare guess this thing is actually Tybalt... Yeah, we OH SO DON'T suspect they will get together. Which worries me. Is she really as old as she's supposed to be? Her actions doesn't make any sense, her conversations doesn't make any sense. I don't understand why so many people love her so much. I'm disgusted by how she handles herself since her pond accident. Already forgot about her family, failing once again to protect the lives of people she was asked to protect. Way to go... Why do people trust her on this anyway? I see no logical reason for that, she doesn't seem to have any abilities making her useful. If she at least could fight with her magic, but no. Every time someone saves her ass and it gets to be Tybalt quite often. What does he sees in her? He seems to have hots for her from the very beginning. Capricious leader like him shouldn't just stalk out of pure malice...? Or am I too naive? Sigh, it hurts to see the world with so many interesting things and such crappy heroine. I do hope it will get better later on. For now I'm switching to books with heroines with more backbone."}
{"text": "The first word that comes to mind when I think of \"Stranger\" is original. I know, I know, it's overused, everything is original nowadays! Even parodies and other stuff that is meant to be referencing something else. But the world-building is truly and startlingly weird in this post apocalyptic world that has somehow managed to reconstruct itself. Although the community of Las Anclas is never placed on any maps, its diverse community with families that do not simply have foreign names but foreign customs and religions sets in the ruins of a large city, probably in the States. These diversity is one of the main strengths of Las Anclas, just as it is one of the main (often wasted) strengths of modern multicultural communities. \n But in the world of \"Stranger\" the otherness that is often projected onto people of different cultures and races, is instead reserved for those Changed by the radioactivity still remaining after the apocalyptic event that ended our civilization and gave rise to theirs. These Changes are often powers to control nature (weather, telekinesis, pyrokinesis) or animal like characteristics like speed, strength or claws. The later produce particularly strong revulsion among some prejudiced 'Norms', although, a it's often the case with homophobia, in many cases it seems to stem not from fear of the known but self-hatred. \n Gay and lesbian couples show up as both main relationships and in the background with a frequency that would be unrealistic in any modern society (and no difference is acknowledged between them and heterosexual couples, although asexuality is clearly seen as strange by young people). But among the many aspects of world-building that make this world difference, it's the implicit acknowledgement of the dangers of childbirth for women. In this world, hormonal changes such as adolescence or childbirth can trigger a person's mutation, a mutation that in the case of pregnant women often kills them and the child they carry. In such a world, it seems not just a matter of freedom to love whoever one loves but possibly of ensuring one's survival to opt for a same-sex relationship (Although the technological and medical facilities at Las Anclas are decent by our standards, it is clear that it has taken generations to created such resources so that it is not outside the realm of possibility that people had no contraception available for generations after the catastrophe). The only large family is indeed the Rileys, all mutated and blessed with a genetic predisposition to survive childbirth. Most other women, whether in relationships with men or women, seem to have one or two children. \n I'm really interested in seeing more of Mia/Ross/Jenny's relationship. I love the idea of them being able to handle a poly/open relationship but Mia and Ross have never had a romantic relationship before and I think that has to trip them up somehow. \n Mutants as a metaphor for difference, be it sexual or racial, are not new but since the problem of difference has not disappeared in our world, it's still meaningful. \"Stranger\" moves a step further by including both flora and fauna that have been Changed, most of it that has in fact evolved into completely different and often dangerous lifeforms such as trees that will shoot their seeds at any living being to use them as soil/food for their seedlings. And even creating symbiotic relationships between humans and nature that both enhance and hurt the person involved. \n At the beginning, like some editors, I thought the multiple POVs and large cast would prove confusing (and the first scene at the school left me reeling), but the feeling soon passed. The characters affection for and interest in each others' lives easily guided me through the complex relationships of the town inhabitants. \n Without being a long book at all, way before the end, I was getting teary eyed for Ross, Yuki, Mia and Jenny and by the time I thought to check for the second time how far along I was, I was almost done. \n Looking forward to the sequel!"}

{"text": "So is there anything about Bella that doesn't scream codependency?? I suppose it wouldn't bother me so much if she didn't remind my of myself not very many years ago, did I just write that? Hmmmmmm. \n Every major relationship this girl has is based on pity or want rather than love. Except the one with her dad, but in that case Charlie isn't really emotionally available to Bella anyway. She NEEDS Edward, can't live without him, can't exist if he is no longer alive. Stephanie dear that's not love it's obsessivness, and there is nothing lovely or admirable about that kind of mindset. It is thoroughly unhealthy. Clingy, needy, Bella would make most guys run for the hills. \n I mean seriously, is there anything more tiring than dating someone who cries non-stop and has to be held all the time, someone who is in constant need of rescuing and who is always asking the question, \"what are you thinking?\" \n Bella's lack of boundaries made me want to scream every few chapters. Infact I think I did scream a few times at my poor husband. After a while he just nodded his head and said, \"I know.\" She says no when she means yes, yes when she means no, and argues constantly over things that don't matter. I mean, seriously Stephanie, pages and pages of arguments over something as trivial as whether or not Bella could possibly accept a gift. The girl creates drama for herself all the time and I confess I find it scary that so many girls can relate to her mindset, it isn't a promising sign if that is true. \n But on the up side it makes sense that Bella is a perpetual victim and has a perpetual victim complex because otherwise she wouldn't make such a perfect target. Someone has to be bait and Bella is good bait."}

{"text": "This book took my completely by surprise and I loved every minute of it. \n WHAT I LOVED: \n -The issues of slavery and war that this book focused on. The idea that the conquered nation was \"civilized\" and the conquering nation was \"barbaric\" is not something that we see in history books (since they always skew whoever was enslaved as somehow lesser...because sometimes the people who 'create' history are assholes). It was such an interesting dynamic to see. Then, when that all gets turned around and the conquered nation rises up, it created another complexity to that dynamic (and to the romance of our main characters). \n -Kestral. She is a strong main character, but strong in ways that are very different than many YA heroines. She is very intelligent, very cunning, and uses those skills to her advantage masterfully. She is always 2 steps ahead of everyone else. \n -The romance. It had a slow burn feel to it. I enjoyed how her romantic interest could keep up with her intelligence, but not quite! She was still a step ahead of him. They compliment each other well, as well as being opposites. Everything I love in a couple. \n -The plot twists. They were done in a way that the story still flowed, and I didn't feel like any were thrown in there just as a way to surprise the audience. They made sense. \n This series is very character driven, and the characters are so complex yet people you relate to. I am so interested to see where the rest of the series goes. I have already pre-ordered the sequel :) If you would like to hear more of my thoughts, I will be posting a spoiler-free review as well as a discussion video on my channel!"}

{"text": "Honestly? This is the most unremarkable vampire fiction book I have ever read. \n At first glance, it seemed to have everything - a cool, sassy main character, loves-me-loves-me-not vampire lovers, and a badass mystery plot to keep things fast-paced and entertaining. \n But then I opened the book and started reading. \n There is nothing inherently bad or wrong about this book, it's just completely predictable - read the first half of the book and you can already tell how the entire series is going to pan out. \n The characters have no real depth or originality to them and aren't very likeable, the plot is one that's been seen before countless times, the \"sassy\" writing seems forced and overdone. \n There were, however, some good elements to the story. Some little quirks that, if Hamilton had developed some more instead of falling into cliches, would have drastically improved the story. These include: \n - Anita Blake's cuddly penguin toys collection. What can I say, feared Vamp Hunters need love, too. \n - Were-rats. Because wolves are oh-so-mainstream. \n - Taking cheesy old-fashioned names to the next level. Because anyone with a name as ridiculous as \"Jean-Claude\" could only ever be a vampire. Or a french 70s porn-star. \n You get the idea. It's the little original ideas like these that made me bump my rating from 2 to 3 stars. \n All in all, it isn't bad, really. It's just 'ok'. Nothing to blow your mind, vaguely entertaining, probably perfect if, say, you're stuck on a 10-hour-long car ride with nothing better to do."}
{"text": "See full review for Misguided Angel at: http://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.w... \n The biggest issue that I've had with this series was the fact that you had 3 different narrators and that they would change every chapter - or two depending on how series the events were in the last chapter. The problem was sort of resolved in this book with the novel being divided into four parts - Schuyler, Mimi, a Venator named Deming, and a sort of epilogue dealing with the three narrators. I liked the switch because you finally got to groove with the characters and didn't have to worry at the end of the chapter of switching to a different narrator. My only complaint was that each section - except for the Deming section - was too short! Just when things were getting interesting with Schuyler and Jack, BAM! Part two: Mimi Force. And just when things were getting interesting with Mimi, BAM! Part three: Deming."}

I mean come on, you have a super sexy alpha possessive yet kind and romantic vampire as an MC and I have to read about Meryn throwing another temper tantrum about not having enough coffee? Please. \n As I said above, quality wise, these books just aren't that great. The writing is lazy, the romance reaches its HEA within the first 15 pages, and there is almost zero conflict. I saw the medium size twist coming a mile away and the twist I'd hope would be there never happened. And come on, insta-love much? Seriously, Gavriel and Beth were in love within five minutes of meeting each other. \n Despite all of my complaints, I did finish the book in one sitting. I don't regret reading it, in fact, I enjoyed it. And I'll probably continue with the series because apparently, I enjoy badly done very fun romance novels with scenes that include giant hulking immortals standing in a grocery store aisle trying to figure out how a condom works and what \"ribbed for her pleasure\" means."}

{"text": "This was really more of a 3.75 ish somewhere around there for me. I did enjoy this book. I like Polly and Diggery as characters and I enjoyed learning about the beginning of Narnia. Sometimes I found the creation story when Aslan was singing to the animals a little boring and the parts where the animals were talking about what do to with Uncle Andrew were unnecessary. Though listening to it on audiobook did help because I enjoyed Kenneth Bragnaugh's various voices for all of the animals. Who would have thought to make the female elephant Scottish?! Nevertheless, the magic was still there along with the wonder so I did enjoy it."}

{"text": "This review published originally on giantsquidbooks.com. \n After reading Mara I couldn't wait for the second book in Veronica Bane's Unusuals series-it was just begging for a sequel. At the end of Mara, the Unusuals have just begun to come together and confront the danger they face from the Stranger as well as their personal conflicts: Mara's past with her abusive brother, Chris' complicated feelings for Miyuki, Miyuki's absent parents. All of that and more develops in this second installment, and-no spoilers- Miyuki leaves the reader hanging off an even steeper cliff than Mara did. \n Once again Ms. Bane uses flashbacks to sculpt a story that is impressively multi-layered, a tribute to Black Hill Press' mission of publishing novellas with the \"focus of a short story and the scope of a novel.\" The characters and conflicts that were planted in Mara start to poke up through the soil in Miyuki and will inevitably bloom in future installments. \n There were things that didn't quite hit home with me-a cast slightly larger than I felt the length of the novella allowed for left me a little confused, and the beginning was a little slow. But when Miyuki hits its stride, it hits it hard! \n My favorite thing overall was the complicated nature of the relationships in this book, which are so much more dynamic than in the average YA story. Few things are made explicit, and characters don't divide neatly in to friends and enemies-leading ladies Mara and Miyuki snap at each other constantly, and the Unusuals are united not by friendship but rather mutual isolation, which I loved. \n Best line: \n \"Do you think I'm a monster?\" \n \"No. I just think you're an asshole.\" \n Also, I mentioned this in my review of Mara but just have to say it again: the cover art for both these books is just gorgeous! \n Miyuki by Veronica Bane: 4/5--and I can't wait to hear more about the next one!"}
{"text": "I recieved an ARC of this novel thanks to Random House and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. \n In all honesty, I had to push myself through this book. Though the writing was beautiful and poetic, a majority of the time, especially when he was writing about the history of the jinn, it read like a drawn-out textbook. His language also, as the book progressed, left me marginally confused. I kept finding myself rereading passages in order to fully understand what was going on. \n The characters in this book were another problem I had with this book. With the exception of Dania, the jinn, they all felt fairly one-dimensional and interchangeable. I found myself not really caring what was going to happen to them or what they were going to do. Along with the characters, the plot didn't connect with me much either. The disjointed nature of it - the transitions from the main plot line to the history and back - made the book just drag on. \n I did, however, enjoy the philosophical nature of this book, and it is one that I'll contemplate reading again in the future because of this fact. Rushdie's running themes of good vs. evil and the nature of love, for example, were thought provoking and will resonate with readers. \n Overall, I was disappointed with Two Years Eight Months and Twenty Eight Nights, though it will not stop me from picking up another Rushdie book in the future. I may also give this one another try to see if maturity, age, and life experience changes my viewpoints on some of the plot points and philosophical ideas that Rushdie tackles in this beautifully written novel."}
{"text": "I put up four stars, which is my default for \"really good book\", but I might bump that up to five as I keep thinking about it. This definitely walks the science fiction/horror line in the way that I like, which is about the world-building and the dissonance from reality rather than the structure of the story itself. It's actually a bit of a horror structure as well, I think, but with science fiction characters. There were a few unexpected notes in the descriptions of bodies -- who is fat, who is small, who is pale, who is marked physically by magic and can it be cut out of their bodies? Still thinking about that. \n I will note that this book, the first in a series, is still 99 cents for the Kindle edition, which as I recall is what prompted me to take a chance on it after hradza's review, and I just went and bought the second book in this series after reading this one."}

{"text": "4.5 Stars for this paranormal menage romance. \n Beatrice is a normal human woman, working as a the only female butcher in London's Smithfield Meat Market. She is agonized by the loss of her best friend, Denny--now missing three weeks. One day she sees a man in the market who had previously appeared on the day Denny had disappeared. \n Beatrice follows this gentleman through the streets to his home--only to get caught up in a strange new world she never imagined existed. A world of vampires. It seems Bea is a rarity in the human world--her Bombay blood is a delicacy many vampires seek and barely find, as a result of overfeeding centuries before. \n Aimery, as the gentleman vampire is called, offers to help Bea find Denny, and as she is leaving his home another vampire, Ryle, arrives. He also senses Bea's Bombay blood. And wants to share her. It seems that Ryle and Aimery have a history of sharing--when it comes to women with Bombay blood. \n In order to protect Bea form open feeding, they become more than just her shadows; and the results are erotically epic. Still, tying up Bea's loose ends means bending a few Vampire laws--and upsets one High Council member, Elfrida--the only one to have never had Bombay blood. Knowing the threat of Elfrida's hunger is formidable, Ryle and Aimery hide Bea away...and begin a new life as a triad. Well, for a while anyhow. \n Delicious smexytimes and even more delicious Brit-speak make for a yummy read. It's a short book with a resolved plot, and the promise of a chase in the sequel, CLAW MARK. I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review."}

{"text": "Disclosure: I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. \n In this sequel to IN YOUR DREAMS we meet up with Zip McKee and Kieran Lanier right where they left off...grounded. And, that's okay. In fact, it's where I expected to find them. Pretty much that's the end of 'expectations being met', however, because the story far exceeded my already high expectations. \n Sometimes I feel as if I know where a story will go, the subtle (or not-so-subtle) foreshadowing leading me exactly where I think the story must end. And, particularly in romance, that's acceptable. Expected, even. But, in reading AS YOU WAKE, I was led a merry chase by That Amy Martin! Kidnapped, as it were, and held hostage to a plot that continued to careen forward down unexpected paths. \n Now, while the story moves forward, the main characters move in opposite directions--Zip to her Dad's and Kieran on a runaway adventure. Just when I thought we'd get a break from the tension good old Kayla tries to make it right, guilty she hadn't been more watchful at Prom. Of course, her idea reunites Kieran and Zip, but now the parental units are involved, and this is both good and bad. Good because the air clears between the two families, bad because it brings new problems to mix: stalker anyone? As the stalker issue gets resolved, we learn more about Kieran's medical history, and begin to hope that the end of his dream-vision doesn't portend the end of Kieran... \n So....I'm a fan-girl. I eagerly await (notice I didn't say PATIENTLY!) the final conclusion of this trilogy. Thanks Ms. Amy Martin for upsetting my sleep patterns. \n Lastly, can I say I love Zip just as much as Kieran? Is that allowed? IDK, but it's true. She is smart, thoughtful, and concerned about her future--qualities I would hope all teen girls would aspire to be. And, Kieran, he's the right mix of awkward teen male hormone angst. He's kind, and funny, and not pushy about the sex...though he's quietly desperate to have it, at least once. So as a couple they match desire with respect, and what better example could we hope for in YA fiction? \n I would recommend this to all teen and YA readers."}

{"text": "Review originally posted on journeyintotheshelves.tumblr.com \n Very rarely do I say that I love a book. Yes, I do give five star ratings, but there is always something that rubs me the wrong way, or I didn't feel completely satisfied. But I absolutely loved Magonia. \n Before I even get into how much I loved the book, let's discuss the gorgeousness that is this cover. It's beautiful, artistic, symbolic, and just slightly hints at what is in store on the inside of the book. I absolutely adore it and it has to be one of my all-time favorite covers. \n Anyway, Magonia tells the story of Aza, a fifteen year old girl who is dying of a rare lung disease (so rare that it is named after her). One day, strange things begin to happen to her: she sees ships in the sky, she hears things that no one else can, birds follow her. She and her family chalk it up to her sickness and hallucinations, but when Aza dies, she realizes that all of the strange things are very, very real. Aza discovers the world of Magonia, of squalwhales and thundersharks, of Magonians. In this world, Aza discovers that she is more powerful and important than she ever was before, and this leads her on a journey of self-discovery and pure adventure. \n The world that Maria Dahvana Headley created was imaginative, unique, and nothing short of amazing. And the characters that she created were no different. Filled with strong and a diverse cast (which was mostly ladies - HECK YES!), they came to life off the page so easily. It was as if Aza was sitting before me explaining what had happened to her. The relationships throughout the novel are dynamic and the characters are easy to love. If you read this book, I dare you not to fall in love with Jason. It is impossible. Headley created this fantastical world but made it feel so honestly real, which, I think, is such a difficult feat to accomplish in some fantasy novels. \n The writing in this was superb as well. Her style was simplistically lyrical, and purely beautiful. My copy is filled with post-it notes tagging all different quotes and sections that I fell in love with instantly. \n My one, slight issue was that I felt parts of the plot were rushed. I felt like the novel could have been just slightly longer in order to flesh out some aspects that were noted, but not deeply explained, such as the ship's crew and their motivations. \n Overall, however, I enjoyed Magonia tremendously. Maria Dahvana Headley took me on a journey through the skies and I cannot wait to go back once the sequel comes out. \n And I have two very important words for all of you: LADY PIRATES."}

{"text": "2? 2.5? Everybody seems to adore this series, so this is a minority report. I'm not opposed to violence and death in novels, but this just seems like it uses both to manipulate readers rather than offer an original story. Instead of actually fleshing out the characters and making the reader care about them, this novel just massacres everyone the leads care about so they seem strong and unbearably put-upon. The villains all suck, and the leads are a boring Mary Sue and Gary Stu. And there's a love quadrangle...why do YA authors still do this? The big plot twist with Keenan...I don't think I've rolled my eyes so hard since a certain werewolf imprinted on a certain vampire's spawn. \n The novel's saving grace was Helene, who actually has some dimension and seemed like a real person. The next novel isn't coming out till 2018, so maybe I'll grow curious by then. At this point, though, I think I'm done with the series."}

Well damn, guess the feels are just gonna be rolling along \n eh I hate how the author made Duke from a nice guy to a complete dick wad and Trevor into mr. perfect.

Who I absolutely hate with a passion.. no really I do. yuck. ANYWAYS, Bishop hosts this feast and then thats when the action comes. tsk tsk tsp Rachel Caine, at this scene you made me cry!

I found myself laughing hysterically at the babble between Myrnin and Claire. Im telling you, I adore those two! Again, this wasnt the best book but the feast and what happens is the main highlight.

{"text": "Every book in Lindsay Buroker's Emperor's Edge series is a delight. Protagonist Amaranthe shows courage as she leads her motley team in defense of the deposed Emperor. Buroker's characters are well rounded, consistent and complement each other. The steampunk world and the politics of power-mongering become clearer as the stories progress. Action and reflection balance and ground the plot, and the pacing is just right. As well, the romance between Amaranthe and the Assassin shows up just enough to twig our interest but does not take over the whole story, and this love relationships moves through reasonable and heart-warming developments as time goes on. I heartily recommend this book and the entire series to those who love a good story and care about the clash of good and evil."}
{"text": "I stumbled on Debora's To Love A Witch late one night when I couldn't sleep and gave it a try - for 99 cents it wasn't a big investment. And it was just what I wanted. A cute, short and easy read that sent me off into dreamland with appropriate thoughts of a hot,gallant hero I could love and a heroine I could identify with. It's hard to find sweet romances that also embrace the paranormal element for some reason but I love them. I'd much rather my uber-alpha hero had magical powers rather than one who has to suck my blood. I've since picked up the first of her `A Modern Witch Series' and she again delivered a wonderful story. These aren't for readers who are looking for a Laurel K Hamilton or JR Ward type paranormal read, but if you are looking for something light and entertaining, I would suggest you take a chance on Debora's books."}

In my review of Released, I expressed how I felt the character Norah, who died, could have played a huge part in the continuing plot. Well, she did from the grave. \n The demons in Chaos were quite extraordinary. I hate spiders and after reading Chaos, I hate them even more. My favorite demon so far is the Smoker Demon. It was the most troublesome demon the characters have fought thus far. \n Overall, Chaos was definitely well worth the wait. It can be read as a standalone book since Megan does a great job building up the story line to give you a good grasp of what's going on in order to understand the plot and characters. I would still recommend reading Released before reading Chaos as it provides more in depth information concerning the plot and the characters."}
{"text": "I am a huge fan of Jessica Day George's fairy tale retellings. She has the ability to take a familiar fairy tale, give it a twist, and still make it good. When I heard about a new potential series by her, I had to jump at the opportunity. After all, she's written over a half dozen different books that have all been amazing, so why would this new series be any different? Unfortunately, it was. \n Silver in the Blood is one of those novels that doesn't just have one major thing wrong with it. Instead, it has a lot of little things that, when combined, make for a truly poor novel. \n First, Silver in the Blood is an extremely slow novel. It was almost unbearably slow. For the first 200 pages or so, readers are given slight hints into what the 'big' secret may be for the family. The characters threw out a lot of side comments, such as 'wait until three days' time, you will understand all' or 'Yes, you will fly, as soon as you learn what it is like to be The Claw'. \n Now, I understand the use of foreshadowing, but unfortunately this was taken to the extreme. I found it extremely difficult to understand how a family that had kept a secret for nearly 17 years would just all of a sudden start dropping these major bombshell comments. It just seemed overdone to the point that eventually I just wanted to scream \"Tell me what this all means!\". \n When there weren't not-so-subtle hints to the family's big secret being dropped, there was non-stop talk about dresses and fashion. The two main characters, 17-year old cousins Dacia and Lou, were extremely obsessed with fashion and dresses, and we - the readers - had to be just as obsessed with it. There were lengthy paragraphs about dress shopping and details about what clothing was worn and why it was worn. \n I completely understand, and appreciate, details about the clothing characters wear. Unfortunately, these characters went a bit overboard. There would be major events going on throughout the book and instead of being upset that there was a kidnapping going on, they would be worried that they hadn't dressed appropriately or that someone saw them in their undergarments. \n I get that at the time, around the 1890s, that women were not as independent or free as they are today. But I would think that if - say a guy was stalking your cousin and creeping her out - you would be more concerned with her safety than what she was wearing or why you haven't received the latest dress from Paris. \n Another aspect that really interrupted the flow of the novel was the random letters or diary entries between chapters. They didn't fit. Sometimes a scene would be interrupted in the middle to show a letter. The reader would read the letter, which didn't have anything to do with the scene, and then the scene would pick up right where it left off in the next chapter. \n For the most part, I was willing to go along with the novel and chalk it up to a light, fluffy middle school/YA read, until 'the scene' happened. I call it the scene because it will be a deciding factor in how you feel about the novel. In order to understand the scene properly, I need to give a little back story. \n Prince Mihai believes that he should be the rightful king of Romania. Dacia and Lou's family have sworn to help him, and his family, place him on the throne as the rightful king. A few things happen, but ultimately things do not go as smoothly as he wants them to and in an effort to get his way, the evil/bad Prince Mihai has one of the cousins kidnapped. It is while she is kidnapped that the dreadful 'scene' happens. \n Before the scene, Prince Mihai is portrayed as a bit mean, a little evil, and ultra-handsome. Readers aren't sure if he's just a goofy, misunderstood villain or a super bad guy. And then this happens. Dacia is kidnapped and out of nowhere Prince Mihai utters this little monologue: \n \"If she (Dacia) refuses, I will simply force myself on her, and ruin her more effectively than simply being abducted in her underthings has already done. And if she still refuses I will tie her to this chair and force her to watch while I have my way with you (Lou).\" \n I am not sure what the exact purpose of this scene was or why it was necessary. Mind you, before these scene things were all fashion, cute boys, and life is easy. All of a sudden the major villain is threatening to rape one cousin and if he doesn't get his way he will continue to rape the other while the other one watches. Now, remember this is ultimately a middle grade/YA novel, so there is some room to debate how appropriate it is for this type of character development. \n I don't think this scene would have been as upsetting, if it had served some purpose. It felt hastily thrown in there and out of place for the character. Not to mention, it never came up again. It was added purely to create drama and make it known to readers that Prince Mihai is evil. It was also done as a way to make women look and feel helpless and without power. It was the jarring effect the scene had that really just confirmed that it wasn't a book I was going to love. \n I will admit that if you stick it out, the book does pick up a little - very little. Approximately around page 225 or 250, things really pick up and there are some action scenes, the characters tend to do more than talk about boys, and the pacing really speeds up. Unfortunately, by that point I think readers are already going to have given up and stopped reading, or they will just be plodding along and not really feeling the story. \n If there is one thing that I did like about the novel, and probably the only reason I kept reading, was the Romanian setting. I found the culture and buildings and time period fascinating. It wasn't enough to offset the other aspects of the novel, but it kept my interest. \n Jessica Day George is an extremely talented author. Silver in the Blood was one of those novels that really just didn't have the 'it' factor to be wonderful. I think die-hard fans of George's other books may find this book interesting and probably enjoy it, but it certainly is not her strongest novel. Minus the rape scene, I could definitely see the middle school audience enjoying the novel, but I think for an older audience it just doesn't have what it takes to captivate people's attention."}

{"text": "I received a copy of this book via Goodreads' Don't Buy My Love program in exchange for an honest review. \n This is the second book in the Valespian Pact series. Books should be read in order. A quick catch up: \n Zeus is a Fal/Amoric prince. This is news, because he'd grown up believing he was Terran--even though he was raised by the Mar'Sani emperor--who fully adopted him and it is with this race that Zeus associates. He has always felt loved and cherished by his adoptive family, but there are factions of Mar'Sari who despise Terrans--the Galactouc scourge--and by extension hate Zeus. \n Zeus has bonded with a symbiote Dar Massaga--Dargon and Alpha--both males who had never connected with another Dar Massaga and can't imagine pairing with a Terran--but they mate. It is through this mating that they determined Zeus' Fal'Amoric race, becasue all Fal'Amoric males are hermaphrodites--and Alpha becomes impregnated by capturing Zues' eggs and combining them with his and Dargon's sperm. \n Also, there is galactic war brewing against the V'Saar, a bug-like species that is brutal and carnivorous, and this war can only be stopped if the Galactic Princes can find their missing third--the Fal'Amoric prince Prometheus. Prometheus has been missing for two decades and, lacking a better candidate, Zeus may be pressed into service-paired the the other Galactic princes--in order to maintain the magical power to keep the V'Saar out of the alliance's galactic space. \n OKAY! \n So, Alpha's about to deliver kits--to be raised in Dargon's marsupial pouch for a year. This is a super tricky exchange and requires a stable environment--not easy to achieve while on board a ship carrying the Fal'Amoric royal family exiles back to their home on Valespia. \n In order to survive, the refugee ship travels with a military convoy of Mar'Sani--containing Zeus' Mar'Sani brothers, one of whom is the heir apparrant of the Mar'Sani emperor. Together they hunt allies--Feteine robots who can help defeat the V'Saar that chase them to Valespia. \n Zeus and Dargon are injured gravely at the power of the Qrxzl--which not only cements a Feteine partnership, but also reunites Alpha with his first offspring, Star Eater. Together this coalition survives the trip to Valespia, but there they face a battle royale, one that results in extreme danger for both Alpha and the kits. Zeus is an amazing tactician, and an unexpected partner arrives with a host of warriors tipping the balance in Zeus' favor. \n Political alliances are further challenged, but the truth wins out, yay! The books resolves, with an ongoing plotline to carry forth--still ont he hunt for Prometheus. \n There is a LOT going on here, and the pace is brisk. I enjoyed this book better than the first one, as we really get a better sense of Zeus and his valor. His family is completely supportive, and Dargon and Alpha are tremendous in their role as partner to Zeus. I am not a fan of Sci-fi, but this book series has held my interest completely. The smexytimes are brief and understated, allowing the emotional context to be the foundation of the romantic landscape."}
{"text": "I really enjoyed this one, particularly the conflict within Shade himself. Runa was very likeable and credible, as were the other main characters with the exception of Roag who was certainly motivated, I guess, but one of those villains who can't be redeemed and is therefore not at all 'likeable'. A thoroughly enjoyable read."}
{"text": "This is considered a \"teen historical fantasy\" novel, the first in a new series called Hallowmere. I have to say it hooked me pretty hard. Set in recent post civil war times, it concerns orphan Corrine who is sent to live at a rather strange girls reform school by a seemingly uncaring and harsh uncle. The school is as grim as you might imagine, with a cold headmistress and an extremely unusual population with a whole lot of secrets. Like girls that have gone missing (who may have been sacrifices of some sort), strange, nearly vampiric Fey living in the bushes just outside the gates, voodoo dolls and strange rites in the middle of the night. It's creepy, engrossing, and very well written. The second book in the series, By Venom's Sweet Sting, comes out in December. Book 3, Between Golden Jaws, is scheduled for April of 2008. \n -Jackie B"}

I'm not sure that I bought the kit and caboodle about monsters and the residual feelings they have.

{"text": "Ruin and Rising is the thrilling conclusion of The Grisha Trilogy. And yes, you must read the other two books first. Why wouldn't you want to? A grand and epic story like this one doesn't come around every day. Leigh Bardugo manages to weave the tangled skein of plots and legends and deception into a satisfying (although often disturbing) conclusion to her saga. The kingdom is battling inconceivable horrors and the champions fighting to save their country seem to fail with every attempt. More than once the situation seems hopeless. Thank the Saints that there are heroes willing to put their lives on the line to restore the nation. And thank Leigh Bardugo for giving birth to this spectacular vision. These books are going to be a tough act to follow. I almost pity the next book that I pick up since I know that The Grisha trilogy is an incomparable accomplishment. These books deserve to be shelved with the Lord of the Rings trilogy in terms of world building. But they are much more fun to read."}

{"text": "This is one of my new favorite books. Holy crap. I didn't want to put it down. It was different and adventurous and fearless and just so good. I loved Leah and her perspective. Her voice was strong and unique and was just the type of character I love to read about. The historical time period is one I haven't read about much and it was awesome to dive into. I loved the little twinge of magic but only enough to make the book unique. The chosen family aspect -- I'm always a sucker for that. But just the plot and the adventure itself! Man, talk about intense and realistic. There was no fear and I felt like I was sucked into the best game of Oregon Trail ever. I am so excited that there is more to this story and more to these characters. Also, I love that there was just enough romance to keep it interesting but it didn't consume the whole book. Which in my opinion is more realistic. And the people of all walks of life that it brought together, the contrast of goodness and badness in people was well done, and only slightly clishe but not enough to be annoying. And finally, the best part, the writing was good. It was varied and detailed and sucked you right in. What a stellar book. \n Conclusion: Need to buy like now"}

{"text": "See full review for Enchanted at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n Sunday Woodcutter is the seventh daughter of a seventh daughter. Because she is such a thing, she has magical properties. Her gift bestowed upon her by her Fairy Godmother Joy is that whatever she writes comes true. It has had harsh implications in the past, so Sunday just writes about her family history. She had six older sisters and three older brothers. Jack Junior died tragically thanks in large part to the royal family of Arilland. Monday was married off to a prince and they never see her anymore. Tuesday died. Wednesday is a little bit strange. Thursday married a pirate king and sends them gifts whenever she can. Friday has a pure heart and a talent with needle and thread and uses it to make clothes for the poor children. Saturday is tomboyish and spends her days with her father and brother in the wood with her axe. Sunday is very lonely, until she meets an enchanted frog who she fasts befriends. \n But the irony - of course - is that the frog (Grumble) is actually the crown prince Rumbold. Thanks to one of her Sunday's kisses, he becomes his human self without any remembrance of his year prior to becoming a frog. All he knows is he is desperately in love with Sunday and needs her to be his at any cost. So, like in most fairy tales, a few balls are held with all the maidens in the kingdom invited. But maybe they aren't meant to live happily ever after... \n As I've said in my previous posts, I really like fairy-tale retellings and this book seemed to be right up my alley. But...it wasn't to be."}

{"text": "3. 5 Sexually Charged stars! \n Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Author and Rock Star PR via NetGalley \n The one thing I love about paranormal is the author basically has carte blanche when it comes to the story. Anything goes, if it's made to be believable. \n Within contemporary books, it's easy to just begin the story, but with paranormal sometimes the world has to be set so we can truly fall into that new world. I found with Alasdair it took quite awhile for me to get immersed into this world. The story started but took awhile to build up. However, once it was built I was more hooked within the story. \n Alasdair, is a very powerful vampire, especially being first sire to Vasilios. He's also one who doesn't stray far from his norm, until he sets eyes on Leo Chapel. \n There's something intriguing about Leo, that has Alasdair drawn and confused. The closer he becomes with Leo, the less that makes sense to him and his world. Leo, doesn't have a hot clue what is going on, but one thing he does know is that he is explicitly drawn to Alasdair. The more he learns the more he's drawn, even though what he learns should cause him to run as far as way as possible. \n As the story goes on, and the more we find out about this world the more the sexual tension builds between Alasdair and Leo. \n \"First, you terrorize me, then you kidnap me, and now, you're hell-bent on destroying my life. If this is your version of playing with your food, I think you've taken it far enough.\" \n As the heat is rising between these two, so is the beginning of the truth of what is to come. \n \"You want to fuck me? Then shut up and fuck me. But you can look at me while you do it. You don't get to forget my face once you're done with me come sunrise.\" \n However, it all ends to soon and we are left waiting for more. \n Did I eventually fall into this world and like it? Yes. Am I choked with the ending? Yes, a bit as cliff hangers can be unnerving at times. However, it's left me wanting more, so I will DEFINITELY be reading the next book to see how it all transpires. Did I like Alasdair and Leo? Yes, very much, but I'm still not sure about Vasilios yet. Did I like the Greek language within the story? Yes and no. Yes, because it always adds something to the story but no because I didn't have a clue what any of the terms meant since my kindle nor itranslate were able to translate it for me. A legend would have been helpful in this situation."}

{"text": "I really enjoy this series. I'm not sure what it is that attracts me to it, but it really has me hooked. \n I really feel as if every book in this series just grows and feeds off of the previous one. One of the things I can't stand in novels is when the characters just sort of develop to a point, but never change. That does not happen in this series. \n I feel as if all the characters are constantly growing and changing with the times. Of course, I still get a little frustrated with some of the elements of the book (oh we're in love, but we can't be near each other, etc.), but I still love this book. \n I do think that anyone who has read a substantial amount of books would know what was coming in this book. But that doesn't mean it's super predictable. I feel it was handled in a manner that allowed people to be 'shocked', but not super surprised (I know it hardly makes sense). \n I honestly cannot wait to continue this series!"}

{"text": "I got THE KING last weekend--which partially explains my recent insomnia. \n This is the twelfth book in the series, and it's main story centers around Wrath, naturally. He is, after all, the king. \n At this point in the series there are many plot lines that are in various degrees of conflict/convergence. The book centers on the ousting of Wrath as King by the glymera, the aristocracy of vampirekind. See they have another person in mind--Ichan, a distant cousin of Wrath's and through him the warrior Xcor plans to rule. The legal mumbo-jumbo of long forgotten vamp lore states that kings must be of pure blood--and any progeny of Wrath and his Queen, Beth, would be 1/4 human. \n Wrath is more than willing to not be King. He's tired of the constant pressure. And now he's terrified that Beth is planning to bring on her own needing, or time of fertility. Wrath abhors the idea of risking Beth's life in pregnancy. It sparks such a rift that Beth actually walks out. \n Now, Wrath has to figure out how to deal, and he's gotta get it handled quickly because there's a lotta hormones in the air. That's right. Beth needs, and Wrath caves. It's all good, though. And Wrath tears out his hair in worry--about his wife and unborn, as well as the throne. At least, he doesn't have to worry about the kingship for long, he's deposed by the usurper. For roughly a day. Won't tell you how he got his crown back but it was NEARLY bloodless. Funny how someone taking away what one didn't want makes a person want it all the more. \n 80's hair-band Cinderella had a song about it.... \n Fear not! The HEA is freaking stupendous. So much love for Wrath, even if he was kinda King Prick for a few chapters. \n Side plots: Assail is punch-drunk in love with the cat burglar Marisol. So much so that he destroys a good bit of his drug pipeline to recover her from the deadly possession of Benloise. Their connection is fierce, and needy. It is rough watching their unfinished business. Will be seeing more of them, for sure--not only because Assail's using Lessers to sell his drugs on the street. \n Via flashback, we get a lot of Wrath's father's story in this one. I really enjoyed learning more about that short-lived reign--and gaining a possible reason for Wrath's blindness--an in utero injury. Fascinating how the intrigues of that court played out in Wrath's own timeline. \n Let's not forget the Chosen Layla and Xcor have a serious attraction. Will she commit treason to be with him? Or, are her overtures the key to peace between the Black Dagger Brotherhood and the rival Band of Bastards? Let's say this: I'm looking forward to Xcor getting his. Next book, maybe. \n And finally, Trez still hasn't submitted to the s'Hibhe to take his place as stud to the Queen's daughter. He's over the nameless sex--focused, unfortunately, on the Chosen Selena. Selena returns his interest, but at what price? His impurity will not keep him from being extracted, and iAm can only keep the executioner at bay so long. In typical Trez fashion, he sweet-talks and sexes his way out of the most dire parts of his predicament. For now. \n Still a lot of plot to build the next episode on. And, we had virtually NO Lesser involvement in this book. Would not expect that trend to bear out much longer. \n It's a satisfying read for BDB fans. Some excellent romance mixed in with the political intrigue and harrowing captures. Plot moves on the trademark Ward pace: fast. If only her next books came out as quickly... :)"}

{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n The mythology in this universe is really interesting but I have to admit proper romance tropes make me feel kinda weird when it's a heterosexual pairing, guess I can't get over all the associations even when the guy in question is great about it. I did like the fact that the heroine is \"curvaceaous\" (or maybe it was \"voluptuous\") and that was made OK. But, oth, it was made OK through sex and the attraction the hero felt for her, which is logical but irks me in my individualist soul that believes we each need to see ourselves as valuable on our own (I don't actually know this to be possible, but it *feels* like it should). One of the central themes of the book being how we can afford to rely on others and be \"weak\" at times, trusting them to catch us, which I agree with theoretically but I'm not altogether comfortable with emotionally, which kept me from identifying with either of them much. \n BUT didn't stop me from reading it cover to metaphorical cover in under three days, so if you ARE looking for romance but want to update from the traditional ones where the girl gets saved a lot to one where she does most of the saving (realistically for her regular person qualifications), definitely go for this. I prefer \"Prisoner\" out of the two and would REALLY like to see Danielle (AKA Five) Torres' story or possibly Nicolette's. I'm really looking forward to more DJ and Echo. \n Oh, when you get there, the pun with the title made me smile :)"}
{"text": "This was one of those books that I was looking forward to reading in 2010. \n I don't know if this is a first or second book but the author is fairly new to writing. While I enjoyed the book and plot, there were huge areas of information dumping. Either when described the land, or characters or background. I noticed that I'd skip huge paragraphs, this did get toned down a lot after midway but it'll be hard for people to get past it. Especially since some of the information isn't really an essential part to the plot. \n The characters were wonderful especially the 2 griffins, the mage, and Kes. All of the characters were emotional, passionate and drawn out very well. \n The plot line was really interesting, and the magic portrayed was really intricate and just what Earth/fire magic should be. \n I did have a hard time understanding the countries and mountains and picturing it. The descriptions didn't describe it as small but troops marched many many miles and the desert area was hard to pictures such a vast area with such a small world that was developed. That and the info dumping were my major complaints. \n The book does pick up and I did enjoy the whole book. I'll be seeing how Neumeier grows with the second book because there was a lot of potential there."}

Meanwhile, Kol Moonring, Captain of the Morgan Guard, has been assigned to protect the rebellious Moria. Against their better judgment, feelings become entangled but at what cost? Will Moria sacrifice herself to uncover the truth? \n I really have enjoyed the Nightwing Series and am of the opinion that to understand what is taking place in Waking the Dragon; you should read Soulfire and Windburn first. Lorian, Jessen, Sorcha, and Linden make appearances in Waking the Dragon. \n Overall I enjoyed the story, but I felt Waking the Dragon was very similar to Sorcha's story. As a result 3.5/5 stars."}

However, I was drawn to him right away after getting to know him. For a 12-year-old boy, he's surprisingly brave, smart and responsible. He tried everything he can to save his family's hotel. \n I fell in love with an ugly boy with a big heart. \n The other characters were amazing as well. Mr. Friggs and his library were admirable, Chef Bunion was really sweet and kind, and Sketchy was so cute! The questionable character of Petula and Paleface makes the story becomes more engaging. So mysterious! I just had to mention this, my favourite visitor to the hotel was definitely Captain Grayishwhitish-Beard, he was generous despite his appearance. All in all, the story and characters were full of surprises. \n Don't let me get started with Warren's uncle and aunt. I can't believe his uncle was so dumb, irresponsible, and all he cares was his wife. As for Aunt Anaconda, she was evil and selfish. She acted so sweet and innocent in front of her husband, I'm so disgusted by her. Warren's father died when he was only at the age of 7, thus explains why his uncle was the one who needed to take over the business. The laziness of his uncle has affected in no visitors and no income. \n To say that I like this book is underrated. I love this book, I adore it. I love everything about it. It was magical, wonderfully fast paced, fulls of humors and surprises. And the plot twists were incredibly good! I didn't see it coming at all! The plot moved quickly and there were so many crazy, crazy things happened in the story. \n The illustrations in this book are so beautiful. They're eye-catching, mysterious and gruesome. The colours that have been chosen were perfect in portraying the story. I need to have this book in physical copy when it comes out in November. Some illustrations are unfinished and not viewable in the eARC, thus I am so looking forward to seeing the complete one! \n This book deserves 5 stars. It's a pretty delightful middle grade book.

I grabbed Ironside, book 3 in the series, almost as an afterthought at last week's trip to Borders. \n After a brief recap of the story in the form of a prologue, Ironside begins on the eve of Roiben's coronation as King of the Unseelie Court. Kaye is unwelcome by his subjects, since she alone has the power to control him (using his real name), and she alone is his weakness. Banished on a quest because of her declaration of love for him, Kaye struggles to find the balance between the life she knew as a human and the life she's learning in the realm of Faerie. \n I love the style of this book. It's fresh and honest without falling into cliches of angst or nonchalance. Black knows how to balance sweeping battle scenes with details like making a bed on the floor. Descriptions are vivid without being verbose; dialogue is snappy and natural. Everything seems to be in place, despite the flip-flopping that Kaye does between Faerie and Ironside. \n While the movement between settings works, the movement between characters is more problematic. My main difficulty with Ironside is that I'm still not certain who the protagonist is. There's almost equal time given to Kaye and Corny, with side trips into Roiben's perpective. In terms of who develops and changes, it's Corny. In terms of a hero, it's Kaye - kind of. Her characterization in this book is weakest, and if you didn't know Kaye from Tithe, I doubt you'd like her in Ironside, because she seems shallow and uninteresting. The really most sympathetic, interesting, quirky, imperfect and lovable character is Cornelius. Although Kaye dominates several key scenes, it's Cornelius whom you feel is leading you through the story. \n The other disappointing part of Ironside, I think, is the loss of the romantic intensity between Kaye and Roiben. There is romantic intensity between another couple, half of which is Corny, and it's darling. Overall, though, the best scenes are the raw ones with Ellen, Kaye's human mother. These are perfectly conceived, perfectly written gems. \n Despite the fact that her style is very different from what I usually read, I really enjoy Holly Black. Her website is friendly and welcoming, and I encourage you to check it out."}
{"text": "I seriously do not know what to do with myself, this book was so good! \n Charley Davidson continues to balance her complicated life as the Grim Reaper and as an unconventional but highly effective private eye. With the help (and sometimes hindrance) of her family, friends, and otherworldly acquaintances, she attempts to unmask an arsonist, stop a serial killer, and figure out where she stands in her relationship with Reyes, the irresistible guy next door- who also happens to be the son of Satan. Humor, intrigue & plenty of spice round out the fifth book in the Charley Davidson series, which gets stronger with each entry."}

{"text": "For more reviews, check out Keep Calm and Love Books \n I first read this book in December of 2014! It was only 18 chapters long at the time and boy were they great chapters. I honestly can't believe I've waited 3 years for this book to come out. It really does feel like yesterday when I first read it and fell absolutely head over heals in love. The whole novel, from start to finish was exquisite! I know I say that about a lot of books but come on, 3 years and it finally came out and all it took were 8 hours to finish it... That's got to speak for itself. Tijan is one of those authors who you know will come out with an amazing story and make you really invested. None of her books should be read lightly, and this one is no exception. Evil was exactly like the title, evil. The word has so much meaning and different variations of it that this book is a cluster ball of it. Tijan actually gives the word a total different shade and viewpoint of what our main protagonist, Shay, and her opposite, Kellan, do. This book was really refreshing and I'm so happy I finally got to finish it! \n \"Slowly, almost gently, I slid a finger underneath one of his and yanked it backward. Kellan held his breath, but let me hold his finger at bay. He tilted his head and narrowed his eyes. They seemed to sparkle in the moonlight...I smiled, and then I yanked his finger the rest of the way until the bone snapped. Kellan didn't move, not an inch. When it was done, after a moment of silence, he rasped, \"Are you going to break the rest of my fingers?\"\" \n Shay was so fully charged the whole time, we were just waiting at the edge of our seats for the explosion! It was so much fun reading about Shay and what her siblings, Kellan, Vespar and Giuseppe, would do to toy with people. Out of Kellan and Shay, my favourite character had to be Gus. She was so real and funny. She did not give a shit most of the time and I did love her bond with Vespar. I really liked how Tijan chose to focus on what other people do/think/act when the siblings are around. We really get insight on how everyone is nervous around them and the fact that a Braden was never to be crossed. The siblings could do whatever they felt like and the rest of them weren't allowed. Tijan made high school drama so cultivating and dangerous! I loved the instant rivalry between Shay and Vasper and we all knew from the beginning that he would never fully love her. \n \"Kellan interrupted. \"You could've stopped him long before I came around the corner. You knew I was coming. Why didn't you stop him?\" \"Maybe I wanted to hear his rhetoric on how hot I must be for him.\" \"Don't be funny, Shay. You're not the funny one, remember?\" I smirked. \"That's funny. I don't think that role's been taken in our family.\" Kellan's hand tightened on my arm. He pulled me closer and bent his head to my ear. \"You always wait for me. Why?\"\" \n I loved Kellan's inner struggle with himself and it really showed his deepest and emotionalist side of him whenever he would try to comfort Shay about being 'evil' yet it would stir the inner turmoil he had inside of himself. The characters in general were all so deep thought and you can see the amount of detail Tijan wrote for each of her characters. \n \"Damien grabbed an apple and paused, shooting her a look. \"Don't start, half child. I can eviscerate you with a thought.\"\" \n Whenever Tijan writes and publishes a new book, I already except it to be a masterpiece. Not one of her novels have cease to disappoint me so I knew it was a safe bet that this wouldn't be any different. I loved this book so much and I'm happy that finally after 3 years, I can now know how Shay and Kellan ended and that I will miss this book so much! The characters are very unforgettable and I am not looking forward to the book mourning period I'm going to have after I post this blogpost. \n \"\"For the record,\" Damien said two days later. \"I think this is incredibly stupid.\" Kellan stood next to me, holding my hand, and grunted. \"For the record, no one asked you.\"\""}

{"text": "This book was a really quick read. While I enjoyed the mystery of the mother, I felt that Simner is more comfortable with short stories and therefore didn't get into as much detail as I would expect about the magic and the war.

{"text": "This was boss. I can't really think of any other way to describe my reading experience of The Martian other that it totally rocked and I loved every minute of it. \n The story follows Mark Watney, an astronaut sent on a mission to Mars with five other crew mates. As you probably guessed, things go a bit wrong and during their evacuation Mark gets hit in the dust storm causing the rest of his crew to believe him dead and leave without him. Of course, he's actually still alive and is now left on Mars with a limited supply of food, no way of getting back to Earth, and no communications to contact NASA. If it was me I'd give up hope there and then but Mark Watney is smart guy and gets to work figuring out how he'd going to survive, potentially years, on a planet that wants to kill him. \n Again, I feel this is book I'm a bit late to the party with but I'm so glad finally jumped on the bandwagon and gave it a whirl because it's one hell of a ride. I haven't read an awful lot of science fiction but I love space and because I'm such a massive nerd the whole concept of this story - the science, the engineering, the rockets (hell, yeah) was all really fascinating. Admittedly a lot of it went over my head but Andy Weir made it all sound so cool. Plus you don't really need to understand all the mathematical jargon to follow the story since you know how things are going from how Mark Watney sums every up as either \"Well, that's fucked\" or \"Yay! It worked!\" \n Which brings me to my next point: Mark Watney is an awesome protagonist. He's funny, super smart, and both equally optimistic and pessimistic to be believable for a guy in his position. The story is broken up in to different scenes which take place in various different places, the primary narrative being told by Mark as he runs us through what he's doing with his extended time on Mars. His narration is told through a series of 'logs' he keeps whilst the rest of the time the story skips to the guys at NASA and what they're up to, or the rest of Mark's crew as they journey back to Earth. The story definitely needed these multiple narratives because having just Mark's viewpoint would have felt claustrophobic and repetitive. Mixing it up and adding more characters stopped it from feeling isolated. \n Having said that, there's only one Mark Watney and he's essentially the only well-developed character in the entire book. It's his story after all I guess, plus you don't really need too much character development where everyone else is concerned since they're all just focused on the same thing and that's the Get-Mark-Watney-Home campaign. They all pretty much say the same things with a load of science talk thrown in which is fine because they're just there to fill us in, and Mark holds the entertainment side of things pretty well on his own. He's got quite a boyish, cheeky-chappy sense of humour complete with boob references and lots of sarcasm which did make me chuckle a few times. The basic plot line is obviously a very serious one but Watney's character added some comic relief whilst still maintaining a continuous feeling of anxiety towards the gravity of the protagonist's current situation (no pun intended). \n I'm going to end the review with a quote from the book: \"Every human being has a basic instinct to help each other out.\" That is essentially what The Martian is. One man is stranded on a foreign planet and the rest of the world try their best to get him home, with Watney relentlessly fighting death along the way. Watney and the rest of humanity refuse to give up hope and I think that's pretty great. We should all help each other out more often. \n This review originally appeared on my blog: Chapters by Amy"}
{"text": "I am very surprised with how much I ended up enjoying this. \n ACOTAR is a loose retelling of Beauty and the Beast, and it is in my opinion one of the best \"retellings\" I have come across. Maas takes the most iconic elements of the story and completely twists them. It's absolutely brilliant. You will have a well known element from BATB that means little to ACOTAR, and then a moment will come up in ACOTAR that harkened back to the fairy tale while managing to feel original and organic to her world. \n Some have complained about the book's pacing. I do find that time advances oddly where Maas makes seemingly random and quick jumps forward in time. However, the first 2/3 of this novel were an absolute treat of character development. It is a slow burn romance. When the pay off comes, it never feels cheap or undeserved. It takes a lot of meandering and can feel plotless, but I am a sucker for that stuff. \n My biggest complaint has to be the last third, which feels like a tired climax at best and a cheap rip-off at worst. Not to say it was ever boring though. However, it did feel like a complete shift from everything before it. But luckily, Maas grounds it through one of my favorite characters of the book (those who have read it know exactly who I am talking about). I can't wait to see more of them in ACOMAF. \n I am a little disappointed that it ran out of steam at the end, but the creativity and development elevate this above other retellings (cough, Cinder, cough). This was such an unexpected treat and I can't wait to see what Maas has in store next."}

{"text": "There is a point in my reading where I pick up a book I normally wouldn't because of how many other people have read it (and liked it). I try to do this occasionally because I feel like it makes me a better reviewer overall to have the experience of some of these books in my repertoire. \n So, The Iron King? Many, many fans everywhere. I hadn't picked it up because it is a paranormal/fantasy type book, which is the opposite of what I normally like to read. I won a signed copy of it at some point last year so it has been on my shelf, and recently decided (with the release of The Iron Knight), that it was time to give it a try. \n I really liked the beginning of this one, probably because it was nearly contemporary as Meghan is still in high school. It starts to get kind of crazy after a little while (and CREEPY for a bit, I was sure I was going to have nightmares about the bogey), but I found the pages turning pretty fast. \n There are many Team Puck/Team Ash fans, but I'm not sure they all declared their allegiance after this book because it doesn't seem quite fair to do so yet. I think I am leaning towards Puck but who knows what happens in the next three books. \n The only thing that turned me off of this one a little was just how much action there was - and that is purely a personal thing. I think if I could get my husband to read it he would really love that part. \n Oh, and my favorite part of the whole book were the pack rats. LOVE THEM. \n I needed a break from the action/fantasy right when I finished, but I will be reading the next in the series soon, as the story is good, the imagery was great, and I am wondering what is going to happen to all of the people I met. I can see why this series has become so popular, and am glad that I took a chance to read it."}

{"text": "This was a good book, I really like Abercrombie's gritty, dramatic and humorous way of telling a story. It was good to visit with some old characters from the trilogy and learn a little more about them. I don't know why, but whenever I read anything Nicomo Costa says, I do it with an Antonio Banderas accent. He is the human version of Puss In Boots in my mind I guess. This book actually had a \"happier\" ending, if you can call it that, then his other books. I was always waiting the the hammer to fall in some weird and unexpected plot twist. \n Overall, very satisfied. I have not ever been disappointed reading on of Abercrombie's book."}

{"text": "This was one of my first steps into fantasy/paranormal series back when I originally read it in middle school, and has stuck with me so much over the years that I recently re-read it. It is one of my absolute favorite books of all time, and the series itself is vastly under-rated, and not discussed nearly enough. \n First off, the world in this series is so fantastic. Really, it is two worlds in one. There is our world, and then there is the magical world that is separated from ours by a wall. The people in our world don't really know about magic, except for those who live near the wall. The closer to the wall you are, the more magical effects you will feel. For example, technology stops working the closer you get to it and more people are born near the wall with magical abilities. This borderland near the wall is a dangerous place to be, because its inhabitants are the first to be hit if something crosses over. \n Secondly, the magic system in this book is excellent. This book revolves around a type of necromancy, which believe me, I am tired of zombies too. But this isn't zombies. The main character is what this series calls an Abhorsen. She goes into Death (which is basically the River Styx), and makes sure the spirits there are contained. She wears a set of bells that each have a separate purpose, and require the wearer to have an expert knowledge in order to control, otherwise, they could end up traveling down the river themselves. The spirits range from the neutral, to the tricky, to the terrifying. \n Lastly, the supporting characters are excellent. Her companion is a talking cat. Need I say more? \n (Also, the villain in this novel rivals Voldemort.) \n Overall, this story is an excellent one. The heroine is strong, without being unrealistic. The world is fantastic, foreboding, and full of surprises. 5/5 stars."}
{"text": "I gave myself the Christmas gift of spending the entire day reading a Sookie Stackhouse book. I sure will be devastated when I reach the end of this spectacular series. And that will be as soon as I can get my hands on the last two books. As I felt about Buffy the Vampire Slayer, it might just be necessary to go back to the beginning and experience it all over again. On the other hand, I am only in Season Three of TrueBlood, the HBO series based on the novels. Sookie is such an admirable heroine. Though beset with trials, tribulations and dangers on all fronts, she can usually maintain her upbeat, optimistic view of life. Considering how many dead humans and supernaturals she sees, this is quite a feat. In Dead Reckoning, Sookie's problems include (but are not limited to) an old enemy who is making multiple attempts on her life, two fairy relatives who have moved into her home, declining business at her place of employment, relationship trouble with her vampire lover, etc., etc. It's almost too much for a young woman to handle. Unless, of course, that young woman happens to be Sookie Stackhouse. Read this book! After you have already read the first ten, naturally."}
{"text": "See full review for Cruel Beauty at: http://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.w... \n Once upon a time, a line of kings that did not allow the barbarians to invade ruled the land of Arcadia. One day, it all changed. Demons took over the land and held it in its grasp. The lord of these demons - The Gentle Lord - made deals with the people of the land. One deal in particular involved a young couple that desperately wanted to get pregnant, but couldn't. The young man struck a deal with the demon lord. His wife would become pregnant with twins, but one of the twins must be given in exchange to the Gentle Lord as his bride when she reached the age of seventeen. The man agreed and his wife became pregnant and gave birth to twins. The first came out easy, but the second twin took the life of her mother. So it was determined that the first twin would be given to the demon lord... \n Nyx has known her duty to the land of Arcadia her entire life. She is to marry the Gentle Lord and find a way to destroy him and his fellow demons hold on their land. She is to avenge her mother's death. She's known and trained for this duty her entire life. But there is hate in her heart. Hate for her father for liking her sister over her, hate for her sister for killing her mother, and hate for her aunt for sleeping with her father. \n The Gentle Lord is different than what she has come to know. He is still a demon and a lord of bargains, but he also has some dark secrets of his own. On their wedding night, he gives two rules to his new bride; one, the key he gives her opens certain rooms in his palace. Those are the only rooms she is allowed to enter, but he cannot protect her from what's inside. Two, every night she will be given the chance to guess his real name. If she fails to guess correctly, she will die. If she guesses right, she will free him from his masters."}

{"text": "Mouseheart was a delightful random read that I came across last year. It wasn't perfect, but it reminded me of my days reading Redwall and had a solid, well-written plot. I really enjoyed reading it and looked forward to other book in the series. Hopper's Destiny is the recently released sequel to Mouseheart. \n Hopper's Destiny picks up almost where Mouseheart left off. Hopper, our hero, is struggling to figure out how he is going to help the citizens of Atlantia. The battle that occurred in the first book may be over, but peace may not last forever and the citizens of the city are not prepared to fight. Hopper believes that the only way to succeed is to work with the outcast Mus encampment that is currently being run by his sister, Pinkie. Unfortunately, things do not go as planned. \n Somehow, upon returning from his meeting with Pinkie, Hopper is transported to the Upland, where he meets new friends who will prove helpful in the upcoming final battle against Queen Felina. \n Overall, I felt Hopper's Destiny was just as strong as Mouseheart. It had solid writing, it was fast paced, and the characters were evolving from the first book. The battle scenes were detailed and didn't border on the grotesque. I really enjoyed seeing how the characters drew out some of the battle strategies and planned for certain events. \n I was really glad to see that the author took the time to make sure that not all cats were portrayed in a mean or evil way. As the story progressed, there were cats that were good, cats that were indifferent. It was a little disheartening to see that every cat in the first book was mean. \n Most of the loose ends from the first book are tied up nicely in Hopper's Destiny. The whole La Rocha aspect of the series is explored and explained (fairly) satisfactory. There are some aspects of Hopper's Destiny that are left unresolved and we have to wait for the next installment, but the ending was satisfactory. It felt complete and not a huge cliffhanger. \n Even though Hopper's Destiny was a strong book, it wasn't without its flaws. One of the biggest issues I had, which was similar to Mouseheart, was the way the mice/characters would do certain things. It didn't make sense to me, unless they were mutant mice. \n For example, Hopper is a mouse. He isn't a giant rat; he is a normal, regular mouse. There is a scene in which he flings an extension cord up and over his head. The cord flies through a mail slot and he uses it to climb up and out of the mail slot. I struggle to see how a mouse could pick up an extension cord (used by humans) and toss it unless it was a mutant. \n The scene above is in direct contrast to the other references to the animals/characters size. There is a beautifully drawn photo of a mouse in a small bed and behind it are human earrings used as wall hangings. It seemed the sizes were disproportionate to what was going on. If earrings were used as wall hangings, how was an extension cord so easily used? \n I don't think the size issue is something children would notice, but I think older readers would definitely question it. Sure, we are talking about talking animals and animals with human-like behaviors, but I just think the portrayal could have been a little more realistic. \n Another issue I ran into, and this is purely personal preference, was Pup (the younger brother of Pinkie and Hopper). He was so mean and damaged throughout the novel, but I didn't understand his anger. It seemed a bit of a forced element to the book, as he just seemed angry or damaged for the sake of plot progression. \n Essentially Hopper's Destiny is a solid second book in a series. Younger readers, who may not be as critical of the character portrayal or somewhat predictable nature of some of the plot elements, will certainly enjoy it. Older readers, especially those that loved Redwall and Warriors, will still continue to enjoy the series. \n Personally, I am still enjoying the Mouseheart series. This is certainly a second book in a series. It didn't wow me, but it was solid and moved certain plot elements along. I'm certainly on board for book three."}

{"text": "Audio book read by Luke Daniels \n I'll start by saying that this is my first foray into the Iron Druid series so this review is from the perspective of someone who hasn't done the previous books. I would not suggest this book as a great place to start this series. I heard this was a great entry point into the series for fans of urban fantasy but so much of what's going on in the plot is lost that I missed the overarching significance of what happened in the story. Now that that's out of the way... \n Shattered is an urban fantasy story about one of the last druids in the world trying to live his life while trying to survive the crazy plots of mythical creatures and gods. Hearne's writing style flows easily and his characters are enjoyable, but I thought the story lacked focus and almost felt like two disjoint stories that didn't really relate to one another until both ended into a third thread. I liked the use of the urban setting and the creative use of different abilities/powers that characters. There are many quotes and references to geek culture in there but so much that it kept pulling me out of the story. \n The first 2/3 of the story has two different threads that are both interesting in their own right but have nothing to do with each other. One thread is about a female druid trying to stop a plague happening in India while the other follows the eponymous iron druid as he introduces someone trapped in time centuries ago to modern culture. Neither story required prior knowledge of the series but the last 1/3 of the story seemed to be a culmination of events from previous stories that was mostly lost on me. I actually thought I was almost done with the audiobook 2/3 of the way through and it felt like a bit of a false ending. \n The world and characters in this story are the best part. I liked most characters, thought they were well written, and stayed true to character. I really liked the old druid getting to know modern culture and hearing his take on how he sees things. The comedy relief and quotes/references to geek culture was a bit much at times and took me out of the story too much. \n As for the audio side of things, Luke Daniels does a fantastic job reading this book. On one side of things I can hardly believe he does all the voices I heard in the book, on the other side the two main characters sound an awful lot like each other and I would get confused at the beginning of a chapter sometimes until I identified who was speaking. Both voices were great and it didn't take away from the story, I just thought it was interesting considering how different many of the other voices are. I will definitely be looking for other audiobooks narrated by Luke Daniels."}

I'm looking forward to continuing this trilogy. \n ALSO, HOLY PLOT TWIST I DID NOT SEE SO MUCH OF THAT COMING!"}
{"text": "Critical Failures #3 A Storm of S-words by Robert Bevin \n The title alone is a work of satire. It was this title that convinced me to check out the entire series! \n A Storm of S-words begins with Tim discovering that Mordred is alive--and shitting in his freezer. Only this series would start with a guy taking a dump. However, Tim & Co can't keep Mordred trapped, and he escapes. Oh, and there's another problem--they've all come back to their world as their C&C characters. \n That poses a unique set of problems for all of the characters. Tim is mistaken for a child several times, which causes an awkward encounter with a pedophile. Yeah, this book doubles down on the already outrageous levels of inappropriate in this series when the story shifts settings to the real world. They need to find Mordred and get his dice, but they have to be stealthy because they draw too much attention to themselves as their C&C characters. This leads to the genius plan to steal a white van--a pedophile van. Tim kidnaps Randy, a gay Southern man, because they need his van to ride around in. This ends with Tim cutting off someone's balls. Of course, that's literal. It's this series. \n Meanwhile, Julian and Cooper go to a CDC poison clinic to resolve Cooper's poisoning at the end of C&C #2. They meet Stacy, the lab tech, who is drop-kicked into this world of crazy. Stacy knows Katherine, who cheated with her boyfriend, and because it's Katherine, she's not the least bit sorry. Now that she's a vampire, Katherine's already stubborn personality gets turned up to eleven. Katherine can turn others into vampires, and she looses control of her first victim, Ginfizzle (aka Ginny). Unable to control herself, Katherine also attacks Butterbean, her wolf/animal companion. She stops herself from killing him, but Ginfizzle wants his blood, leading to a massive vampire-on-vampire brawl. Anytime Katherine appears, she's bound to cause problems. This is no exception. \n This brings me to the best team-up of C&C: Katherine and Cooper. These two incredibly selfish yet weirdly endearing characters have to track down Ginfizzle before he turns others into vampires and kills his way through Mississippi. Katherine and Cooper's rampage starts with a revenge trip to the pizza delivery shop where Cooper used to work, where he terrorizes his former manager, Derrick. Then, Cooper and Katherine invade a Dick's Sporting Goods because that's a plot in this story. That scene is the absolute best in the book. This is also the first time I've read some weird hybrid of NFL slapstick/satire in a fantasy book. Go with it. \n While Katerine and Cooper destroy Mississippi, Tim, Stacy, Julian, and Dave brainstorm how to fix their major problem of still being their C&C characters. To capture Mordred, they use Stacy as a honey pot trap. She goes on a date with Mordred to the Olive Garden, which ends predictably poorly when Katherin and Cooper's hot mess hunt for Ginfizzle tips off Mordred that Stacy was bait. This ends with Stacy being transported to the C&C world and becoming the prisoner of the Four Horsemen. \n Mordred's ultimate weapons are his dice, which give him the ability to summon the now leveled up Four Horsemen to usher in the Teenage Dick Apocolypse to the real world. They corner Mordred, and because this series isn't going to end anytime soon, Mordred's plans go awry, but the ultimate problem--how to go back to normal humans instead of C&C characters--isn't resolved. \n Rating: 5 stars. This is the best C&C book in terms of action, plot, and character development. It's also the best fantasy novel title pun I've seen. \n https://hdlynn.wordpress.com/2016/08/..."}
{"text": "I liked it. It reminded me of Tamora Pierce's novels actually: the heroine is a strong female called to do some great deed, there's a sprig of romance (not a main theme but it's not minor either), has the perfect blend of fantasy and adventure and keeps its readers turning the pages. All in all, it was wonderful."}
{"text": "Maybe it was the translation as this was originally written in Italian but something was missing from this book. \n It seemed like I knew what was going on but the author HAD to have a mysterious feel to it so there was information not told to the readers that would have made it easier to understand. \n I don't think a kid would honestly know what was going on or even really care as there is mystery but no big \"evil\" pending. There is an evil but readers aren't allowed to know about it because it's so mysterious. \n I really wanted to like this book, but it just seemed stilted to me."}
{"text": "This series is really starting to grow on me. There is just something about it that really makes me like it. The only complaint I have is that this book is a bit of a transition book. So not much really happens but it still was a fun read!"}
{"text": "Took me a while to get used to the way it was written and things were presented, but I absolutely fell in love with this book and the series, and plan to get the third one whenever I can. A very well-put together fantasy, one that I can revisit time and time again. \n The characters were incredibly interesting, the magic sublime, the plot easy to follow and I did want to follow it! Recommend to all who love \"smart\" epic fantasy novels that aren't just fantastical tales of magic and swordplay."}

I won't go into detail but overall I was happy with this book and this ending, but certain things felt unnecessary to the story and other things I felt weren't resolved well enough.

{"text": "Roses and Bones: Myths, Tales, and Secrets is a compendium of three of Block's books. I had not read any of these previously, but I had read several other of her books years ago when I was in college, like the Weetzie Bat series. I remembered liking them at the time, and enjoying her writing style, so I picked this up at the library a few weeks ago. I can see why I enjoyed her then, but I did not enjoy this as much now, as an adult. \n The thing with Block's writing is that it is very intoxicating, on the surface, because she is very gifted at writing dreamy, magical prose that pulls you in to a beautiful yet tragic place. She is excellent at describing scenery, people, clothing, food, and so forth, as well as portraying emotions like longing, puppy love, and emptiness. However, deep down, it's all quite depressing. Her version of love, as another reviewer commented, isn't true love, it's misguided lust, codependency, and one-sided obsessions. Or is that \"true\" love - that is, is that reality? I like to think not... \n Her writing used to suck me in, because I so wanted to be one of the characters in her books: gritty and beautiful and adored by at least one person who could see past my imperfections and love me with every ounce of their being. It would be us against the world, holding hands and forging our way through endless bright lights and dim rooms and drinks and parties and people and we would be fabulous amazing sparkly rock stars whether anyone else realized it or not...and so forth. That is no longer a goal of mine. I would like a real relationship, where we have independence, and aren't dead inside when the other is away for five seconds, thank you... \n But I digress... \n This book in particular is essentially three stories of all of that - central female characters that party and sleep around and are all quite unremarkable and fairly damaged, but her writing makes them seem like they are something to aspire to be. \n Psyche in a Dress, the first book, is written in a poetry-esque style. I am not familiar with the original myths that it's based on, and although I was going to look them up as I was reading this book, I got lazy and didn't. I was fairly confused throughout the story because of my lack of knowledge of the original stories as well as the cryptic writing. It was so-so. \n The second book, Echo, was easier to understand, although she jumps around characters quite a bit and it gets hard to follow. Each chapter is narrated through a different point of view from the one before, and some of the characters have more than one name. Nevertheless, it isn't too difficult to piece together, although I wished I had a flow chart at one point to track all the people everyone was sleeping with. Echo, the lead character, really bothered me though. She had a psychic power which allowed her to see into someone's past if she did an erotic striptease for them. Seriously, what the hell? The way Block writes it makes it seem like this is some magical, mystical, amazing thing where she sees into boys' souls and then heals them by having sex with them, but to me it was just some patriarchal BS. She always is left empty inside because they never stick around, so it's just another example of a woman serving men in a non-equal situation. Screw that. \n The third section was a bit different. It's a collection of very short stories that are all variations on fairy tales. Some of the originals I was not familiar with or I couldn't quite correlate with the original version, but others translated fairly well. A couple were cute, especially Tiny, a variant of Thumbelina. My favorite, and probably the only thing I truly liked in the entire book, was the Snow White adaptation. I won't spoil the ending, but it's how I've always wished the story ended up."}
{"text": "A classic."}
{"text": "Readers of Ovid looking for something with a little more sex and magic would do well to dwell in these pages. Like A Guile of Dragons, Wrath-Bearing Tree is a book whose mood implies it is best savored on a stormy summer afternoon, or from the comfort of a stuffed chair on a cold and bleak autumn night. \n Continuing the early adventures of Morlock Ambrosius, Wrath-Bearing Tree begins by giving us a taste of life in the kingdom of Kaen and how easy it is for one of the many city gods of this continent to be replaced by an usurper. It stands to reason, then, that when Morlock is thrust into the middle of this, his only way out is to kill a god and return home to the Graith. \n But no sooner is he home than he is sent back to Kaen. Something more is going on on that scary continent, and more information is needed about the Two Powers, believed to be behind the fall of many of the city gods of Kaen recently. While readers of A Guile of Dragons will remember the role of the Two Powers in the return of the dragons, this second volume was still approachable as a stand alone novel. Before the novel ends, Morlock and his companion will face warring gods, living machines that grant apotheosis, and a wintry father figure named Merlin driving a sleigh led by eight tiny demons. \n Morlock and his companion's journey reads like a medieval travelogue, cataloging the strange customs and unusual creatures and beliefs found along the way. I enjoyed the book, though it was a bit more graphic (NSFW) than expected. Enge again delivers a well written story set in a mythos that is so familiar to us, painted with the elements that have defined the landscape of fantastical stories for centuries, and yet delivered in a fresh and entertaining story."}

Legend wasn't really my cup of tea and this series had been so hyped that I tried not to get my hopes up too far. But it was kind of hard not to when I started reading this book and it took me away from the very first chapter."}

{"text": "A quick read that may be time better spent re-watching the series on DVD. Despite being quite authentic in channelling the voice of Gabrielle, this slim volume basically recaps seasons 1 and 2. It does not give extra insight into the characters and even the convincing voice suddenly drops away in the second half, leaving only dull platitudes."}
{"text": "I really liked this book. I haven't read a lot of fantasy books, so maybe this is more of the same, but to me it is really good. I like how every character is real, not all good or all bad, but human. They all look out for their interest, because it is a game of thrones. And they all want something (power, money, etc.). So, even if there aren't any \"good guys\", you still find yourself liking some characters, and rooting for them. \n I also liked how its like every person in this books is \"alone\". And I don't mean it as alone alone, but more like they feel alone. There isn't really any character that is truly happy or finds true happiness, but I thinks that's mainly because of the whole game of power the \"kings\" must endure. Still, I think the book is well written and will definitively read the other books in the saga. I recommend it!"}
{"text": "I liked this book. I didn't fall in love with it. Partly because it is so short. I read this really quickly and yes I'm an adult, but it just seemed another way to milk money out of kids. Why did it start when it gets good? At 10 dollars a pop for a book 50 dollars for this wouldn't be bad. I really hated that it's barely a story in this book. \n The things that I did like is the imagination involved. The pictures in the book went beautifully in with the story. It does help to have some pictures especially since it is for children. Over all so far it's a great book and a great way to get kids excited about the whole fantasy aspect of the books."}

{"text": "So at first, this is a tale of a princess doing her duty to her kingdom, marrying to seal an alliance and end a war. It's not her choice, and it scares her, but she's determined to see it through. \n Only, readers of STORMSINGER might recall that the prince to whom she's betrothed isn't exactly the princess-marrying kind. He prefers men. But he has a royal duty to see through, as well. \n Add to this some political treachery from those who would profit by continued war, an assassin seeking to protect her autistic little brother, and and a front-row seat to the developing romance of an infamous lady privateer, and you have an idea of the places this could go. \n (Orya is my favorite.)"}

{"text": "Anson is a Dragon King who fought beside Ulrik in the Great War centuries ago--to end all humanity. When he saw that the war wasn't helping his beloved brown dragons survive, he flipped sides and joined Constantine to build the dragon bridge and send his dragons to another, hopefully safer, realm. \n Now, his existence, and that of all the Dragon Kings, has been revealed to the human race again, and Kyvor Inc, a tech conglomerate, seems to be at the root of their troubles. We encountered Kyvor's trickery in SMOKE AND FIRE when Kinsey returned to Ryder--this time at Dreagon Distillery, the home base for all the Dragon Kings. Now, Anson is tasked with helping Kinsey infiltrate her old company, to see who knows what, and how they found out about the Dragon Kings. \n Kinsey has identified a possible confederate, Devon Abrams, an up-and-comer at Kyvor who has no idea she's been shadowed by Kyvor agents for a long time. Anson's struck by Devon's beauty and fierceness--and inexplicably wants to protect her almost from the get-go. Is this the pull of a true mate? he wonders... \n So, this book is a ramp up to the large showdown. That means there are many points of view all bringing the end of the story into alignment. For this reason, I would not recommend picking up this book first, if you are intrigued by the series. You really need to go back closer to the beginning because it's choppy and confusing if you haven't met any of the players before now. This book is a lovestory for Anson, but it's less fixed on his romance than I would have liked. Devon is a good lead for him, but they don't have much time to make a connection before they are both captured and tortured. The goal here is to get Anson to reveal his powers, and he's all too happy to do this, because, well, he has little love for humanity in any case. \n For the first time Dragon Kings learn that their main adversary isn't Ulrik--but also his scheming uncle. And, the forces are marshalled to bring down the ultra-powerful Druid that nobody knew anything about--except the bad guys. \n As a romance, BLAZE a little too cluttered with the long-range plot arcs of the series, for me. I really like to experience that high of meeting and falling, and it felt too convenient and too rushed--and too interrupted for me to really latch on. The ending climax is really intense though, and I'm still anxious to see what happens between Constantine, Ulrik, Rhi, and all the other characters--as well as the human mates of the Dragon Kings. So, I'll look forward to the next book, too. I received a review copy of this book via NetGalley."}
{"text": "Sophronia and the gang are at it again! This continuation of the series is just as good as the first two and the stakes are higher for our heroine as she grows older and closer to taking a side as an intelligencer. I was so proud of her as she did her best for each of her friends and learned more about herself in the process. I can't wait to see what happens next! \n I loved the running joke explaining why some people had less than stellar manners. :)They are Scottish. \n The best thing about this book for me was the Soap/ Sophronia friendship. There was a more serious tone to this book as Sophronia really came to understand that Soap's life was different from her own due to his skin color. Early in the book, Sophronia kept insisting that she wouldn't let their respective stations stand in the way of their friendship. Soap knew better, but let her think it anyway. Then she realized that she had let his station dictate her relationship with him. I thought her musing near the end of the book was so telling as she was told that they would have to learn that life wasn't fair and she realized that Soap already understood that lesson."}

I was enthralled with the variety and intensity of sexytimes these two got up to, especially as Lynn, being a kraken, can change his sex. Anderson seems to prefer the male Lynn, but he has no trouble loving up the lady bits either, when Lynn goes undercover. \n There are five or six novellas that follow \"Wriggly\" and \"Sparkleson\" as they build a life together, even if their work partnership fizzles. I really enjoyed their hi jinks and how they were smart investigators--and handled all the misadventures they got rolled up into, even by accident. I don't want to reveal all the fun stuff.

{"text": "Don't let the cover fool you. This is NOT a children's picture book. While the size and drawings may make you believe that that is what you are getting yourself into. It isn't at all. \n The Adventures of the Princess and Mr. Whiffle tell a tale of a little princess who lives alone in a castle made of marzipan. Her best friend is her stuffed teddy bear, Mr. Whiffle. These two do everything together and readers get a glimpse of that within the first part of the story. \n The unique aspect of this book is that it \"ends\" three different times. The first section of the book will leave readers with a sugary sweet ending, the middle one is a little sad and the last ending is the one that makes it clear that this book was NOT a children's book. Where you leave the story off is up to you. Readers can read one, read two or all three and get a complete story each time that they read the story. \n As an avid fan of teddy bears, children's stories and anything out of the ordinary. After I had been shown the preview pictures that were released last year I felt this book could have been written for myself. I was eager to see what The Adventures of the Princess and Mr. Whiffle held. \n The book is a very quick read with only a dozen or so words per page at the most. It stands at 72 pages and most are full page pictures that spread over a single page or both pages. \n While this story is definitely not one I'd read to the normal picture book audience, I believe that it would be fine for an \"older\" child who is okay with a bit of a sinister dark side to stories. For the adults, this book takes us back to our childhood a little but this time it shows a sinister side that picture books didn't have. There are essentially two readers that will enjoy this book. Adults and older children. I think some teens might not understand the big deal behind the book and younger children will be a bit scared, too little to understand it. \n Personally I enjoyed the story. As stated it holds all the elements that I hold near and dear to my heart. With that aside, I think a lot of readers might be very very disappointed in the book. Why? There was so much hype to this book and I just don't believe that it really lives up to that hype. There are very very few words to the book, the story is over before it began. Those that have children might enjoy reading this out loud and seeing their expression as you read the book outloud but for some adults it might be a bit disappointing. \n While the story is quick and a bit short the real gem within this book are the pictures by Nate Taylor. I've read this book a half dozen times and each time I find myself looking over the pictures and just loving them. There are tiny little details that I didn't see the first or second time I read it. These pictures are what saves this book. \n Overall, this picture book for adults/older readers will be a hit or miss book. It'll depend on what your expectations are going into the book. If you're looking for an adult story with pictures and details, you won't find it here. If you're looking for a quick fun read that you can occasionally pull out on rainy days, then you'll enjoy this book."}

{"text": "So when I read the blurb of the first book, Grave Mercy , I was curious to see how it would turn out. And then when I got around to reading it, well...I GOT MY MIND BLOWN AWAY!!!! Come on, Assassin nuns= Awesome. It's next best thing after Ninja Mutant Turtles. \n Then I found there was a sequel- time stopped (Hell, even the Earth stopped rotating around the sun), my heartbeat sped up and I pumped the air with my fists repeatedly. \n The story starts out with Lady Sybella, one of Death's lethal assassins and d'Albret's daughter. She was assigned to report about d'Albret and his followers' doings by the abbess. Sybella, of course, hates it. So when she was ordered to rescue a prisoner from a dungeon (oh, my lovely Beast), she had no idea that her idea of an escape and her chance at true love had arrived. Taken along with Beast and his squire, Yannic, they travel to reach the duchess, facing enemies in their way and finding new allies. \n Sybella is a kick-ass heroine. She doesn't lack in intelligence because she always makes the smart decisions. I remember Beast pointing this out to her in the novel. She kills when she needs to defend and protect the people she loves, but doesn't take her own sweet time while immersing herself in self-pity and guilt. She's wonderful. \n So when I read about all the awful things that happened to Sybella- well, I felt deeply sad and overly emotional. But it was these very own things in her past, however horrifying they were, which helped mould what she is now: a clever, wonderful woman who would do anything for the people she loved. Of course, Beast sped the process along a bit. I am so glad that Sybella found him and fell in love with him. She deserved true happiness. And so does Beast. \n I was actually quite nervous about how R.L. LaFevers was going to portray Beast as the love interest. From what I heard about what he looked like coupled with the fact that it was his very battle lust that made him such a valuable asset to the Duchess, it seemed very incredulous that he could manage to love somebody like Sybella. \n Of course, I sorely underestimated him. How adorable and big-hearted is Beast? I don't care if he's \"apparently\" ugly, but I love him the way he is now. I've read so much about heroes being cold, distant, cocky, arrogant etc (apparently guys being rude to the heroine and acting distant to \"protect\" her is a huge turn-on) that Beast came as a relief. Yes, he might have gotten angry at Sybilla one time in the book, but that was in special circumstances. If I was in his shoes, I'd be furious. So, best wishes to the couple, Sybilla and Beast, may you have a wonderful, wonderful life, because, hell, you guys deserve it. \n And then if the romance wasn't enough to turn me into a gibbering, hyperventilating idiot, there was also a plot. A real plot. A real plot with political intrigue. A real plot with political intrigue and a manic father. The storyline was great, it was carefully paced and it was original. 5 stars."}

{"text": "This book did not disappoint. I loved it from the very first page. Funny, dark, demented and did I mention funny??"}
{"text": "I didn't really enjoy the second installment, I felt it was a little dry and had too much military gun descriptions. But boy is this last installment more then I bargained for. It was great! \n Everything is wrapped up and that's what makes it a great trilogy. Nothing is left over for possible sequals. \n The characters are still nice but a little one sided but the story and depth of the story are what makes this story great. There is a lot of imagination and intertwining of Earth and Wonderland that makes this great. \n I would put this up with the first book and I really liked that book!"}
{"text": "Based on the title alone, or even the blurb, I would not have chosen to read this book but I am glad that I ignored my initial thoughts and paid more attention to the glowing reviews instead. I bought this book months and months ago and it has been sitting on the Kindle unread (as has the second book in the series Magpie). I kept seeing it cropping up all over the place so finally decided to read it. \n This book appears on over a dozen Goodreads lists with a lot of votes in each category (placement current as the time I write this review). For example: Best Gay Slave - 1st, Best Gay Shifter - 4th, Best Gay Book Based on Fairytales - 2nd, Best Gay BDSM - 7th, Best Gay Romance Published in 2010 - 7th, so it was definitely time for me to give it a try! \n For a fairytale-based book about avian shifters (which sounded really strange to me!), I really enjoyed this book, much more than I thought I would. The characters were really well developed. The avian shifter element was relevant in terms of where each species fit in the avian ranks and therefore what behaviour was expected but it was largely irrelevant to Ori and Raynard - the development of the relationship between them seemed so effortless, built on their natural instincts and desires. \n I enjoyed the way the master/submissive relationship was presented and the deep emotional tie each man felt towards the other and the turning point that came with the 'blood in the dining room' incident. \n \"The most valuable possession my master owns is his submissive. I will take great care that no harm comes to my master's submissive whenever he is not there to watch over me himself.\" \n It was fascinating to see the turn of events once Ori had experienced his first full shift and his true species was identified and I loved the eventual outcome. I didn't even mind the couple of times in the book when the characters shifted as it really fitted with the flow of the story (I was sort of expecting to be put off by the change from human form to a bird!). \n So all-in-all, I am really pleased I tried something a different! 3.5 stars \n I now publish all my m/m reviews on my blog so if you want to visit all my m/m reviews in one place come visit at Because Two Men Are Better Than One!"}

{"text": "The thing about the Nightside books is that each story has an interesting mystery plot and the series as a whole has an awesome fantasy arc, but far too much of every book is spent on infodumping, in loving detail, all of the fun that the author had worldbuilding. I found I was too jaded to get interested in new settings or characters after the first few books because so few of them are ever seen again, and even the ones that do recur often have only bit parts in later stories."}
{"text": "Jekel Loves Hyde was an interesting paranormal type read based on the Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde novel written in 1886. I was intrigued to read it originally because of the cover (I've got a thing for purple/green), and because I knew that a lot of people were looking forward to it. I had not read anything by Beth Fantaskey before (but had heard many good things)! \n I was mildly disappointed after reading this. The story moved a little slow, and Jill was rather oblivious to a few things happened that I figured out right away (and trust me, I'm pretty good at ignoring clues so that I don't ruin things in books and movies). I also got very confused in the beginning, trying to figure out if Tristen and Jill's alternating chapters were happening at the same time or as flashbacks or as continuations of the story. \n I also felt as though some of the situations weren't as tense for me as the reader as they should have been - there are a few high anxiety scenes, but I rarely was glued to the page as much as I would have expected. \n This was a solid read, and perhaps even better for someone who is a fan of Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde. I would be very interested in reading Fantaskey's first book, because the writing was good - I just didn't connect with a few things in the story."}

I loved the characters the dialogue was really realistic. \n It's simple in that there's nothing overly complicated about the plot line but the plot line is unique and fresh. \n I'd love to see more of these characters as there is so much room for more story lines, and if LIsa keeps up what she's doing they'll all be hits. I hope this book goes far and I'll be recommending it to anyone that asks me for a book to read!"}

{"text": "This book started out SOOO well, and then descended into a major disappointment. I think superheroes who wind up having to face the alpha Superman type good guy because he's turned is over done, and cliche. I think Moore could have thought of a better plot line, because, even though I didn't like the end of this book, so much so that it ruined it for me, I think he's pretty gifted."}

{"text": "Overall I thought the book was alright a world that went through the zombie apocalypse and a group of people trying to survive it. The main character Mary was intresting, she always questioned weather their lives should be like they are trying to survive the undead everyday. Mary is always curious and is always seeking answers to the things around her, which at times can get her in trouble. While the rest of the characters were great for the book, Mary at first was an intresting character, but I started to get annoyed with her because of her obsession over a boy and him to be with her claming it to be love. Overall I enjoyed the book and the way Carrie Ryan wrote it made it suspensful and page turning."}
{"text": "\"Meterra - Il destino in una biglia\" e un romanzo fantasy la cui ambientazione gravita tra Genova, un luogo indefinito della Francia e il mondo fantastico di Meterra. Trovo la copertina del libro bellissima, ben fatta e perfetta per la storia narrata tra le sue pagine. \n L'autore usa un vasto repertorio di vocaboli, riconducibili sia a dialetti locali che a termini ricercati, di rado utilizzati nel parlato. Ciononostante, la lettura resta scorrevole, l'ampio vocabolario di Cisi finisce per creare uno stile di scrittura particolare ed insolito, che definirei quasi \"onirico\". Interessante e la scelta di narrare la storia da diversi punti di vista, sebbene essa finisca per confondere inesorabilmente il lettore. Cisi, infatti, cerca di dare voce ai pensieri di molti dei suoi personaggi, narrandoci le loro storie su una linea temporale parallela. Cosi, mentre l'autore ci parla delle avventure di Mimi su Meterra, la sua penna ci trasporta a Genova, tra i vicoli della citta vecchia dove le dispute si combattono a colpi di biglie. Al contempo ci vengono narrate le vicende dei segugi di Vox, gli antagonisti della storia, che finiscono per avere la loro voce all'interno del romanzo. Molte volte mi sono quasi trovata a fare il tifo per gli antagonisti, sintomo che l'autore e riuscito nell'intento di far immedesimare il lettore nei diversi personaggi. Ho apprezzato molto questa scelta, e a Cisi va il merito particolare di essere riuscito a tenere le redini delle diverse storie e ad intrecciarle in modo perfetto ed ammirevole, compito che si prospettava arduo e pericoloso. Una pecca di questa scelta narrativa pero c'e, e non posso fare a meno di sottolinearla: cambiando continuamente punto di vista (spesso all'interno della stessa pagina), lo scrittore finisce per disarmare il lettore, che non riesce ad immergersi completamente nella lettura e immagazzinare le informazioni necessarie per proseguire e capire cosi l'insieme della storia. Le situazioni create sono tantissime, cosi come i personaggi che le vivono, e spesso mi sono ritrovata a dover rileggere parti che mi ero lasciata alle spalle perche non ne ricordavo piu gli importanti dettagli. \n Le descrizioni si presentano molto dettagliate agli occhi del lettore; Cisi descrive con dovizia di particolari le battaglie a biglie dei monelli del Borgo degli Scontri, cosi come le altre innumerevoli situazioni che si creano all'interno del romanzo. Forse sono un po' prolisse pero, l'autore avrebbe potuto evitare di dilungarsi tanto su alcune scene e dare invece importanza a cose piu rilevanti all'interno della storia. Infatti, del tutto insufficienti sono le descrizioni che l'autore fornisce delle creature magiche di Meterra; ho apprezzato molto l'originalita di Cisi nell'inventare nuovi mondi e nuove creature, purtroppo pero il lettore resta insoddisfatto, poiche l'autore non fornisce descrizioni adeguate delle novita fantasiose che introduce, rendendo cosi un po' sterile l'immaginazione di chi legge. Il lettore, avido di risposte, non sapra mai chi sono realmente i simpatici bleur, non conoscera la loro storia ne i loro costumi. Nulla viene approfondito sulla societa che abita Meterra, non una parola viene spesa per descrivere la cultura, la religione... Insomma, il mondo creato da Cisi resta un po' abbandonato a se stesso, sospeso in una nebbiolina offuscata. \n I personaggi presentati da Cisi sono molti, purtroppo pero l'autore non riesce a caratterizzarli in modo soddisfacente, soprattutto se si considera la mole del romanzo. La stessa protagonista risulta poco profonda, quasi come fosse appena abbozzata. Sembra che l'autore abbia creato quasi delle \"macchiette\", dei personaggi con personalita piuttosto fisse che li caratterizzano solo superficialmente. Mimi Maresco, la protagonista, appare fin da subito come una tipetta tosta, coraggiosa e irriverente; al termine della storia la troviamo cresciuta, anche se resta pur sempre una bambina. Tra gli altri personaggi troviamo Virna e Marcello, gli amici di Mimi; beneducata lei, quasi zoticone lui, resteranno per tutta la durata del romanzo piuttosto fissi. I due personaggi che forse mi hanno incuriosita di piu sono i reietti Egulash e Ballisto Bal, che Mimi incontra su Meterra e che l'accompagneranno nelle sue avventure. Anche in questo caso l'autore delinea due personalita piuttosto statiche, che portera avanti per tutta la durata del suo libro. Egulash, scontroso e brontolone, cerca sempre di fare il duro della situazione mascherando i sentimenti sotto una coltre di muscoli ed indifferenza. Bal invece e piu accomodante dell'amico, quasi paterno con Mimi, e rappresenta l'antitesi di Egulash. I due finiscono dunque per battibeccarsi a vicenda, dando animo alla narrazione. interessanti, ma sempre poco approfonditi, i profili psicologici dei segugi del nemico, gli allievi del cosiddetto Formicaio, un'accademia per assassini. \n Per quanto io mi sia sforzata di trovare tra le pagine di \"Meterra\" delle tematiche, non sono del tutto riuscita nel mio intento. Sicuramente vuole essere un romanzo di formazione; Mimi all'inizio della storia ha dei comportamenti infantili, mentre nelle ultimissime pagine si fa piu matura, responsabile e consapevole. Cisi dunque trasmette al lettore il dovere, la responsabilita e le rinunce che comportano l'entrata nell'eta adulta. Mi e sembrato quasi che l'autore abbia voluto trasmettere anche un messaggio ambientalista tra le pagine del suo romanzo, ma in modo blando e quasi impercepibile. \n La storia di per se non si discosta molto dal fantasy tradizionale: una ragazzina prescelta il cui destino sembra inesorabilmente segnato; un mondo magico in cui la protagonista viene catapultata, strappata dai suoi affetti; una profezia antica nascosta nelle viscere della terra; antagonisti che cercano di ostacolare la missione della prescelta, senza un vero motivo o un movente valido ed originale... insomma, tutto appare piuttosto tradizionale, ma l'originalita della storia e data dalle ambientazioni, a meta tra fantasia e realta, dal linguaggio narrativo, dalle creature magiche che l'autore ha inventato per la sua storia. Meterra e un mondo da scoprire, Cisi ce lo svela, e purtroppo in parte ce lo nasconde. \n Purtroppo la storia non ha un vero e proprio finale, sembrerebbe piuttosto un inizio. \"Meterra\" ha infatti tutte le carte in regola per essere il primo capitolo di una saga fantasy; molti quesiti vengono lasciati in sospeso, ma non si sa se l'autore abbia intenzione di pubblicare un seguito. \n In definitiva, seppur con i suoi non trascurabili difetti, \"Meterra\" mi e piaciuto, anche se non ha saputo emozionarmi come speravo. E' un romanzo che ha in se tutti i presupposti e le promesse di una storia unica e fantasiosa, purtroppo pero non decolla e lascia un po' il lettore a bocca asciutta. \n Lo consiglio agli amanti del fantasy, a chi desidera una storia scritta con uno stile particolare e a chi vuole immergersi in un mondo ricco di ricordi d'infanzia."}

{"text": "The Heroes were a pleasant summer read worth 3,5 stars. For me it was tipped to four stars by humorous passages of Corporal Tunny. There are many tie ins with the trilogy, but not necessary to understand the story. \n By nature, The Heroes are more hack'n'slash read, full of fighting - it's depicted quite well so I don't dare to call it a weakness. However I didn't like the last, after battle part, which was too much explanatory for my taste. Abercrombie's first-time reader won't probably appreciate the status of Bayaz anyway and those who know don't need to spell it out. Moreover the character of the witch has no ending and serves as a cheap way to get Bayaz involved and let Black Dow know more than he should know. \n In the end, it's still a good, well-written book."}
{"text": "I loved this book. Frist of all, I've got to say I enjoy reading SOME YA books and this is one of them. So don't expect it to be about life or something. Yeah, its got vampires, but in a different wa than Twilight, so lets not even compare the two of them. I've read some complains about the main character, Claire, and how she is dumb or annoying, like she doesnt question anything. But having read lots of YA supernatural books, I actually think this is one of the most unselfish, grounded, intelligent and less annoying of all the heroines out there (or most of them, anyway). She is smart, so when she sees there is something wrong with the town, it doesn't take her too much time to figure out they are telling the true, so why questioning? And then they talk about not going back to her hometown. Well, thats manly because if you know the town's secret, you cant leave. So there. But hey, we all have different tastes, so maybe you wont like it. I personally really enjoyed this book!"}

{"text": "I have finally finished the Way(toolong) of Kings. Please take what I say with a grain of salt you have been warned. \n This book is entirely too long. By about 200-300 pages. There is really no need to describe every single solitary item, place and feeling in the whole book. For example a passage about the intricate design of a door comes to mind. Why was it 5 paragraphs long? The other major complaint is the lengthy conversations about nothing. I know it was all in the good of \"world building\" but really it could have been cut back. \n The speed of this book varied. There were times when I was rolling right along, page after page. Then BOOM I hit a wall and the book dragged slower then reading the dictionary. It was this massive problem that left me with conflicting emotions. Did I like the book? Did I not like the book? I have to say it was iffy. \n With all that said, this book did have many many elements of predictability to it. I saw about 90% of what was coming before it happened. \n I'll probably read the next book because \"The Almighty\" knows I like to torture myself. The second book could blow my socks off you never know! \n So over all, I enjoyed parts of this book. But really think it could have been trimmed down a bit and I would have LOVED the book. There is a lot of potential there for a great series but don't expect to be completely wow'd in this book."}

{"text": "4.5 stars for this intriguing M/M fantasy romance. \n Theos is a Sacrati, the fiercest of warriors in the Torian army. Torian society is communal--the men fight and conquer new lands, and protect the women and children who live within sheltered cities in a collection of valleys in this world. Men and women do not marry in Torian society, they meet rarely for procreation, but otherwise are separate. The prized warriors, like Theos, have many invitations to copulate with women, to produce offspring, but most of the time, the men are game to take care of their sexual needs with their comrades (as do the women!). \n As a sacrati, Theos is above a lot of the menial army business. His warlord, however, has been acting mighty shady. Under Theos' command, a band of Elkati men are captured well within the Torian borde. It is clear they were attempting to return to neighboring Elkat valley, but Theos knows the value of a good captive--his men will all get a cut for selling them as slaves. And, Theos has the right, as commander, to choose a slave of his own from the captured. Not that he plans to, however. Keeping a slave is expensive and he would do better to claim the slave's selling price for himself. \n Only, it doesn't go that way. The leader of the Elkati, a fair man called Finnvid, is a healer and a scholar. Theos is especially wary of the strange way his warlord watches Finnvid, and desires him. His suspicions are further augmented when the warlord is enraged by Theos' decision to keep Finnvid, rather than let him be transported through a mountain pass for sale at the onset of winter. Finnvid is not like the men Theos knows. He is verbally opposed to the idea of men having sex with each other--in Elkat such a thing is despised. Moreover, Elkati have monogamous marriages, and this seemingly random copulation within Torian society is as foreign to him as Chinese is to me. It turn out that Theos has 46 children, with more than a dozen women in the city--and more on the way. Finnvid = Mind Blown. \n Still, Finnvid is a secret keeper of the highest order, and the most significant is his BROTHER is the Elkati King. Returning him to Elkat is imperative, but there are so many secrets and lies, that the politics is nearly as dangerous as the winter mountain passage. \n There are double crosses, and double standards and murder most foul. Throughout, Finnvid must come to terms with the most hated part of himself--the part that desires men sexually, and Theos in particular. I was fully engaged in this fantastic world. I felt like I was taking icy steps through the snowy mountains, or sweating in the ice huts and soaping up in the bath house. All the secondary characters are beautifully detailed, having real experiences that impact the story. The political machinations were fascinating, and I really found myself drawn into the story--hoping that Finnvid and Theos would find themselves alive, and together, when the final page came. \n While this is not a traditional romance, and not even a traditional 'slave' romance, there is a constant expectation that Finnvid and Theos will work things out between them. In the meantime, I was rather relieved with how decent Theos was--he had no dearth of sex partners, and he never forced Finnvid to become one of them. They spend a significant amount of time together, and the rapport that develops is quite natural feeling, as are the experiences of regret and loss when they are separated. Still, I had to laugh at how stubborn they both were. \n The book ended in such a way that I don't anticipate a sequel, but man! I'd like to see how all change in Torian society shakes out... \n I received a copy of this book via NetGalley."}

{"text": "This took a while for me to get into. I really wanted to like it - and yet for about half the book I struggled. The writing is witty and amusing, the plot cleverly constructed, but the narrator is just so *present*. I am someone who normally likes to get lost in a book. I enjoy a book if I forget I'm reading it, if the characters and the images are planted in my mind as I read with no intermediary. This was not the case with this book - the imagery is certainly vivid, the characters memorable, but the narrator makes himself heard. You can hear the author writing. You can see him doing his utmost to be witty and clever. And while his tone is certainly amusing, I personally felt it detracted from the story somewhat. \n At least, that is, until all the seemingly separate threads of the story got tangled up into impending doom for everyone, and then I got so completely sucked into the fate of the cast of characters who'd snuck into my head that I finally forgot I was reading, and the book balanced into masterful storytelling. \n The characters are brilliant and it would make an excellent film."}

Jem has come with news that Emma and Julian have decided to become parabati and that they want Clary and Simon to be their witnesses to such an event. Simon and Clary agree but they don't understand why all these people had to come to tell them that. Until they have the tea. \n Something weird happens after they drink it.

Simon and Clary don't know what it means, and when they wake up Jem explains that they had water from the Lake, which caused the hallucinations. Apparently, despite the fact that Simon is 19, according to Shadowhunters he is still 18 and can legally become Clary's parabati especially because they passed the water trial. \n This another novella in the series that I'm not quite sure what to make of.

{"text": "*Sigh* Badass lady knight, and somehow, I didn't love this book. I liked the first part where Aerin trained with Talat, but the story felt more disjointed than I'm used to McKinley's stories feeling for me. I think there's also an aura of melancholy in this story that pervades it, always keeping me from truly loving the other characters, even though Aerin is awesome. Her riding around and killing dragons and evil wizards with Talat--the best. Everything else--including the other characters? Meh. I particularly thought Luthe was underdeveloped, and while I did like that Aerin got to be with both men, introducing a love interest halfway through a story is difficult to do. McKinley also clearly took the narrative view that Luthe was a better match--a truer love--for Aerin, but that was never freaking shown in the story. Oh, and then, everyone dies. Well, not everyone, but the deaths of the king and Perlith, one of Aerin's major antagonists, robbed the story of meaningful resolutions. It's weird that McKinley sidesteps her character's emotional journey this way by doing the 'easy' thing and killing off the character instead of letting them resolve their plot somehow--even if messily."}

{"text": "I received a copy of this book foe review via Goodreads' Don't Buy My Love program. \n Michael is a 21 y/o human with a serious grudge. His best friend, Scary Mary, had been used sexually and then drained of blood by vampires. After two years of searching he learns where the last vamp hangs out. While waiting for Gray to arrive, Michael is approached by another man, Wild Bill, who seems down for some action. Michael is a novice gay man--pretty much innocent--and while he's attracted to Bill, he's got a mission: drug Gray and stake him, by whatever means necessary. \n Gray does arrive, and he takes Michael's bait--they leave the bar only to be joined by Bill. Things go from hot to molten fast in Michael's barren hotel room. Expect a seriously hot menage. And, a twist that tells us more about Bill than the reader perhaps expected. \n My biggest complaint? I wanted more! The book is very well-written, the world well-conceived, and the pace excellent. I wished it was longer so I could stay with these folks a bit more."}

{"text": "There are major pros and cons of this book and it's just easier for me to list them then write out a review: \n Pros: \n -The characters were realistic in that their relationships were real. Abby's relationship with Jason was real feeling and described really well. There were parents, rules and curfews. No one was running around at 5 am with the parents allowing guys to hop into girls beds at night. (I know the guy might be a wolf/vamp whatever but really what parent goes \"Oh it's ok I'll let my 15 year old cuddle with the new guy at night\") \n -The writing was captivating I was drawn in and spent hours reading this straight through because after the build up the story was just gripping and had me. \n -unique YA romance idea. I thought it was going to be the same old same old and it wasn't, which was nice :) \n Cons: \n -Time traveling is in this book. And really I understand what is going on with the Master of Time but I don't get the whole premise I can't say too much without spoiling this so I'll just leave it that I was a little confused with the door and some of the elements around it. \n -Lots of teen kissing. Sometimes I think teens in teen books only kiss and then have battles to fight but I could be wrong. Maybe I just lived in a dull area. \n -The cover says \"The HourGlass Door: A Novel\" that implies ONE book. There is no mention of a series or anything. This book has so many lose ends for a series that the whole \"A Novel\" shouldn't be on there but that's just a quirk of mine. \n Overall this was a clean, fun, great read with just a few flaws But I can't wait for the second book."}
{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n I am numb...an emotional wreck. Part of me is glad I am off this emotional roller coaster and the other part wants to jump right back on. First off, let me explain why this isn't 5/5 -- I thought it was tied up too nicely; the bow was too pretty. There were certain aspects of the war that I wish wouldn't have been resolved: \n -Amren didn't need to come back (I mean I am fne with that fact that she did but I would have prefered that she didn't) \n -Someone of the core group needed to die (it's WAR people! Not all of them should have lived but again, I am okay that they did) \n -The whole Drakon Mirdyth situation is probably going to be expanded on but it was annoyingly swept under the rug \n -What was with the Queen/Firebird? Again, not resolved = annoying \n BUT!! All that being said here's what I loved: \n -Feyre discovering and confronting her sense of self \n -Rhys's resurrection (FREAKIN' HEARTBREAKING!!) \n -Nesta and Elain killing Hybern was the best thing ever! \n -The fact that the whole story felt like a love story about Feyre/Rhys but also between the whole family which I loved \n -Tamlin not being hated but not quite forgiven, you know, he's an ex. You can't hate them or you will only hurt yourself. I loved how she gave him light and let him go. \n -Nesta and Cassian all day every day! \n So yeah. I liked it. And I want more. And I might just go back and reread the whole thing. Cause I can. And I can't quite get my head out of the world yet."}

{"text": "See full review for Darkest Hour at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n After everything that Suze has been through during the six months that she's moved from her home in New York to Carmel, California she wasn't prepared for this. In her stepfather's household you have two choices in how you spend your summer vacation: you can either have remedial tutoring or you can get yourself a job. There go Suze's plans of laying out on the beach all summer. Instead, she gets herself a job working as a onsite babysitter at the Pebble Beach Hotel and Golf Resort. It's not a bad gig. She gets paid ten bucks an hour and whatever she earns in tips, and the clientele that stay at the hotel are the elite. The big problem this week though, is that she is stuck with a kid named Jack Slater who no one on the staff likes because he's afraid of everything. And Suze gets stuck with him for the second day in a row. \n But she won't let Jack's phobias get her down. So she'll forcibly removes him from his hotel room and takes him down to the pool, where all the trouble starts. On the way, they run into a gardener who just so happens to be dead. Jack runs screaming from him and when she asks him what's wrong he tells her quite seriously that he can see dead people. Suze has got a little mediator on her hands. And when she's not training him, she has to worry about what her stepfather is up to in the backyard. Because even though he's trying to install a hot tub, where he's digging there are a few ghosts who aren't happy about it. A few ghosts who know Suze's roommate Jesse really well... \n Okay, so here's something that I don't think I've confessed in my other reviews for this series. Before I knew that these were a series, I read Haunted - book 5 - first and fell in love with Paul Slater. He was the ultimate bad boy and sure, I didn't understand what Suze's problems with him were because I hadn't read this book, but man...I was really team Paul there for the longest. Now, as I'm rereading this series for the umpteenth time I realize how much of a jerk and crybaby he is, but man...I miss the good old days. lol."}

{"text": "No, no, no, don't let the steep decline of quality of the books happen. It's going so, so well. \n After reading through the previous two books, Lover Revealed is such a disappointment. It might have been my fault that the expectations that I held this book to were impassable. But after reading through the emotional, roller-coaster novels about Rhage and Zhadist made it hard for me to restrain my hope that Lover Revealed will be perfection as well. \n I also find the constant switch in perspectives extremely jarring. It's even more annoying when the characters have little to no relevance to the plot/story of Lover Revealed. Whenever a random character pops up in the middle of the story, I'm always questioning their importance. \n Now on to Marissa: \n I don't believe that Marissa is so perfect that the sun shone out of her arse. To the contrary, she's one of the weakest heroines I've come across. Granted, the society and the cultural values she was raised up with did affect how much of a backbone she possessed. But still, it took a Herculean effect not to throw the book across the room. I was just so frustrated at Marissa for not standing up; but I have to say, her family's even worse. So maybe I should congratulate Marissa for not turning out to be a basketcase. \n Although she does remind me of someone.... \n Game of Thrones, anyone? I find them so similar. \n Daenerys=Marissa \n Viserys=Most of Marissa's family. \n Hopefully Marissa will take a leaf from dear old Dany's book and grow a backbone by the time the series ends. I think she might develop one sooner at the rate she's going. I always love to see a little character development. \n 2.45ish stars"}

{"text": "2.5 stars for this YA fantasy. Some spoilers ahead. \n The blurb indicates this is Quin's story, but the POV is actually that of four teen-ish characters: Quin, John, Shinobu and Maud. Quin, John and Shinobu are all training to be Seekers, while Maud is a Dread. In this world are some futuristic weapons and old artifacts, most importantly the athame, a stone dagger which directs navigation through space. \n The apprentice Seekers are told their role is to be defenders of humanity, but this is not the case under the current trainer: Briac, Quin's father. Briac is a mercenary who uses his power to kill for pay. John already knows this--Briac had attacked his own mother years ago and stolen his family's athame. It is John's sworn duty to get it back. \n Briac holds John apart in the training, however, neglecting to complete it. John is banished, and urges Quin to run away with him, as they are a clandestine couple. Quin won't; she believes in her noble purpose as a Seeker and is elated to proceed and learn to work the athame, as is Shinobu--until they discover they will be compelled into murder-for-hire. There's a whole lotta angst, what with being an assassin at age 15... \n Maud is a different creature than a Seeker. As a Dread she is to oversee the Seekers, and make sure they use the athame for the good of humankind. She had been trained (for centuries) by her master, but he is resting between planes and his apprentice is overseeing her--with extreme brutality. She can help the fledgling Seekers, but isn't sure if she should. \n John returns to claim his athame, leaving Quin's home and family in tatters and bleeding. The rest of the book is a chase through the space of their world for John to regain his athame, Quin to lose-then-regain her memories, Shinobu to become an opium addict then redeem himself, sorta, and Maud is finally able to make the proper choices to right the wrongs which occurred while her master slept. \n In truth, I have a low threshold for liking fantasy, but this was a convoluted book. Many times I stopped to read something else, and I can't say--even after finishing--that I'm glad I completed it. The threads of this book were woven too loosely for me to see the tapestry. Too many breadcrumbs leading toward later parts with no real cohesiveness. The end was cliffhangery, with a resolution that left the remaining players in pursuit of each other, which was frustrating after such a long read. I know there's a sequel planned, but I'm not sure I'll pick it up. There was nothing wrong with the writing, but the story never grabbed me. There was no trust between people who should have developed a rapport; every character was some awful shade of bad. Parents lie to their kids, knowing it will do them harm, because of a sworn oath? I call BS on that. Sorry. No oath is going to force me to make my kid a murderer. Not one of the adults in his story had one scrap of decency. And, the kids? Quin and Shinobu fall apart. John's the only one with a backbone, and I'm still not sure if he's capable of doing the right thing. \n It's just my opinion, but this book was more hype than story, for me. I received a copy of this book via NetGalley."}
{"text": "As a children's book, this is not quite up to the usual level of complexity to be found in GRRM's other books (notably his \"Song of Ice and Fire\" series), but it is still a good story. Children should enjoy it and it is refreshingly lacking in a \"Disneyfied\" happy ending."}

The narrator - Juliette - not only has a different name (if I have to read one more book where the MC's name is Anna, Bella, etc. I might scream) but her vocabulary is extreme out of this world. She is very vivid in her use of adjectives and similes. I also liked the concept. A dystopian world where everything is in shambles and then there's this girl who has the power to kill a person just by touching them."}
{"text": "3.5 stars \n Though a bit slow in the middle (where much time is spend gathering our band of warriors and researching defenses) this is a solid fantasy adventure with interesting characters, a lush setting, creative bad guys and enough unresolved issue to fuel more entries in this planned series. \n The Middle Eastern style setting is almost a character in itself, and the heroes of the tale are atypical and well layered individual who are fighting evil in its many forms- whether from shadowy foes who steals souls and display unearthly powers, or the everyday atrocities that occur in a society with a huge gap between the working class and those with means and titles, and even the internal battles that they wage against the personal obligations of duty, belief, honor and sacrifice. \n Saladin is one to watch, and I am definitely willing to visit Dhamsawaat again."}

{"text": "A tad predictable but entertaining in its entirety. It's one of those books which would keep you reading til the very end (without any breaks in between) but after finishing it, it's not something I would rave about to others. I don't know why it's like that for me because technically there was nothing outwardly wrong with it. The writing was clean and precise. The changes in perspectives were as natural as they could come. The only thing I didn't like was Leon and Honoria's brief stint in romance. \n That scene in the hospital where Leon was like moaning about how if he wasn't in a relationship, he would be with Honoria? Wow, that's a new level. I know Harley isn't likable but by all means, if you don't like her, break up with her instead of staying out of some misguided sense of honor. It might make you feel good in the short term but there's a reason love and trust are the foundations of any good relationship. \n And then Honoria was all like, How sweet and how honorable. Now I care for him even more because he's so asdfghjlkl. Cue broken heart and longing. \n Overall, it was a good read but not that memorable. \n 3.85 stars \n I received an ARC in exchange for a honest review."}
{"text": "4.5 stars, 7th&up \n Sierra Santiago's life is changed forever after she realizes that she is part of a long line of gifted artists who can use their talents to battle demons and keep humanity safe from darkness. \n Older's novel is just wonderful- full of sass, a firm sense of community, and fast paced action. Shadowshaper is more than a simple fantasy adventure, it touches upon some big issues such as gentrification, culture theft, empowerment, pride, and more. Despite the range and density of the themes, the story is never bogged down, but instead is paced perfectly for an entertaining read with plenty of depth. \n Highly recommended."}

{"text": "Fullmetal Alchemist is a thoroughly entertaining, original, and satisfying story. At a hefty 27 volumes, it can seem intimidating. But this series is full of humor, heartbreak, and relentless action. The main story really begins to beef up at around volume 15, and from then on it is a nonstop ride. It echoes several themes present in many popular series, including Harry Potter and the Hunger Games. Thankfully, this series also has perhaps the most action-packed and emotionally satisfying climax of any series I have read thus far. It doesn't quite reach the level of being an absolute masterpiece, but certainly deserves all the attention it can get."}

{"text": "A struggling young woman searching for meaning in her life, a tragic family event, a mysterious man...this story starts off with all the paranormal fantasy hallmarks. The main character Arionna reminded me of Elena from the first season of the Vampire Diaries when she was introduced; this is not a bad thing. Remember how you used to care about Elena? Back in the day when she had agency and choices? Me, too. If you liked that version of Elena, Arionna is the protagonist for you. Arionna cares a lot about her dad and friends. That said, Arionna falls into the trope of lost-little paranormal heroine once and a while; the bonus is she doesn't need constant saving, so that's a thing. \n Rating: 3.5 - the beginning of the book is closer to a 3, but the mythology reveals elevates the later half to a 4. \n Go to blog for the full review"}

{"text": "I received a copy from the author in exchange for a fair and honest review \n 3.5 \n This book was original, entertaining, exciting, and yet a little underwhelming. \n Seventeen year old Charlie lives with her aunt. She suffers from severe anxiety and is eventually home schooled because of it. She doesn't really have any friends and spends most of her time alone. She applies for a job at a tea shop and everything changes. She learns that there are witches, vampires, demons, and that she has a special role to play in their world. Her love interest is vampire, which is strictly forbidden (inter-species romance is quite the no-no.) But isn't that the fun? \n I think the story could have benefited from Charlie being a touch older, something closer to nineteen. Her thoughts were far too wordy for a seventeen year old. In fact, I think most of the characters should have been a little older. Their age and maturity just didn't seem to fit the epic nature of things they were preparing for. No one seemed to know what they were doing, yet they were all confident that things were going to work out. While I was reading, I was reminded a bit of the first few seasons of Buffy. (Complete with forbidden romance with older, brooding, handsome vampire). It seemed mostly a bunch of ill equipped kids dealing with things way over their heads. \n There were several instances of TSTL syndrome, and not just from Charlie. But mostly Charlie. Are you trying to get killed? Charlie was constantly over confident in her ability to follow through with things that she'd only practiced once or twice. \n Her romance with Desmond was a bit of a mystery to me. Most of the time, I just didn't see it. Well, at least from his end. Her age and her actions/thoughts were just so inconsistent. In one instance she thinks something along the lines of never having kissed \"a boy\", then another she is thinking about being in love with \"this man\". It just struck me as odd. She really lacks anything to make her interesting or special beyond her supernatural role in everything. I think it would have been different if we had gotten more than a short chapter in Desmond's head. I just didn't understand what attracted him to Charlie in the first place. He's very vague when she asks the inevitable, \"why me?\" I wanted his affection for her to be more than the cliche of \"innocent girl makes not so innocent supernatural being remember his what it's like to be human\". That always bothers me because it's so generic. If it were me, I'd straight up ask, \"So any innocent human girl would do?\" But still. In the end, it doesn't matter. I'm a sucker for it all. Give me misunderstood and brooding, and you've got me. Give me tall, dark, and handsome and I'm there. In a heartbeat. \n Okay, now that it sounds like I had a problem with everything in this book, let me say, I really did enjoy this book. In fact, I really enjoyed this book. Once I started it, I breezed right through it in two sittings. While a little convoluted, the plot was really the strength of Singing Fire. I just loved it. I've never really read anything like it, honestly. And in this genre? That's really saying something. Everything's been done. I loved the secondary characters, and I loved that there were so many of them. I even loved that there were so many things I didn't understand. Mostly because it made me super anxious for the next book. So many unanswered questions! I'm very excited for the next book. Give. Now."}
{"text": "I had seen Guardian of the Dead being nominated for awards and decided that I wanted to see what the hype was about - unfortunately, this book didn't really fit with me. In fact, it reminded me of a book I ended up not finishing not long ago (The Jumbee), which didn't give it a great start. \n Based in New Zealand, Karen Healey certainly has a unique setting. This was perhaps my favorite aspect of this book. \n I did not connect with Ellie or the Maori story. At times I found it ridiculous, and other times I got really confused with all of the details and the way the relationships were connected. Though my reaction may not totally be fair because I generally am not one that likes mythology type stories as I am a more contemporary reader. I did enjoy Ellie's voice and the way she attempted to deal with situations, for the most part. She is a character I would have liked to know in real life. \n The ending of Guardian of the Gate got more complex and grabbed my attention more than the beginning, but wasn't enough to redeem the entire book for me. The multiple plots and stories and characters do eventually come together, but I think the entire thing was a little too complicated for my tastes. \n Guardian of the Gate is a book based on mythology in a different setting, and would be a good read for those interested in mythology or Maori. Many on Goodreads gave this book a very high rating, so please check out a few other opinions before using mine as a reason to not read :)"}

{"text": "4th&up. \n Before she received widespread public attention for The Hunger Games Trilogy, Suzanne Collins wrote another amazing fantasy series called the Underland Chronicles. I just reread the first book- Gregor the Overlander- and it was every bit as good as I remembered. \n With an absent father, an overworked and stressed mother, not enough money and too many responsibilities, eleven-year-old Gregor has a life he wouldn't mind escaping from, but he doesn't expect to escape to another world! That's just what happens, though, when he and his baby sister fall through a laundry room air duct and into a subterranean world called Underland. Populated by huge bats, rats, cockroaches, and spiders, as well as people unlike any he's ever known, Gregor finds himself caught up in the adventure of his life. \n I highly recommend this wonderful fantasy/adventure series."}
{"text": "I am underwhelmed by this book and I am so very upset to admit that. I had watched and haunted the release date for this book since I heard of it. Needless to say, I was super stoked to read it. I've spent some time thinking about what I want to say about it, what exactly bothered me about it and I think it comes down to three main points: the relationships, the plot and Feyre. (Minor-ish spoilers ahead) \n Tamlin and Feyre- It's almost hard to figure out why they fell in love. I know what we are supposed to think, that it is because they both have the burden of shouldering the responsibility of their families and people, as well as their obvious attraction to one another. However, I wouldn't be able to tell you why they are good together. I love romantic story lines and I was excited to see where theirs would go, but it kind of stilted especially near the end. \n Feyre and Lucian- A guy heals you once and you cannot be sure that he will be back to heal you again? Why? He healed you and wants you to succeed. Color me confused. \n Feyre and Rhys- If this is leading to the dreaded love triangle, I might throw a fit. How often in life have you ever had two separate guys pining after you at the same time? Especially, when you are so obviously in love with this other guy. I'm sincerely hoping it's not going to be a \"who should she choose\" type situation, where the conveniently mentioned mating bond foreshadowed such a trial in the upcoming books. Please, don't. Please. I like Rhys, but I like him in the as my ally sense. Not the, I'm going to his court to make googly eyes at him sense. \n The plot- First 3/4 of the book is basically Feyre at the manor learning to do what she wants, instead of what she needs (Tam included), and then the last 1/4 is the fight against the terrible \"She\" alluded to throughout the first part. I was worried that the trials were going to be spaced out over the next few books. Thankfully, they weren't, but I do wish that whole section had been moved back. \n Feyre- Do you look up to her for caring for her family for so many years? I'm not sure, I do know you're not supposed to pity her because she doesn't want that. And if you are empathetic, be careful about it- she may mistake it for pity. I'm so happy that she went after Tam, it's just crazy to me that she loves this guy so much she doesn't believe its worth it at some point. But hey, I understand that mistakes are made and humans/faeries/creatures are fallible in general, who wants to be perfect? I just hope she grows some more in the next books. \n It's sounds like I don't like the book, even now typing this review I'm asking myself \"I thought you really liked the book?\" I guess I was just hoping for more. It had such promise. I will definitely read the next one. Fingers crossed Feyre keeps her eyes on the prize --> Tam, he literally was the prize."}
{"text": "This book started off a little choppy a lot of the background isn't presented up front instead you have to read between the lines on a lot of things. As for the writing it's hard to get into but once you pick up on it it's a really good book. \n The magic and magical background was a little confusing and hard to follow based on how it's written but overall it wasn't a drawback and it was an interesting read. I probably would not read it again though."}

The anime (Seirei no Moribito) devoted a full season to just the first book of the series, and I think that was what made the difference -- parts of the book feel rushed and incomplete, after I have seen a more fully developed visual script. \n Still, I like the premise and without the book, the anime would not have been made. And I have a guess that some of the richer development in the anime came from later volumes in the novel series. Still not a waste of time, by any means. \n Note: it's difficult to review translated books, as so much depends upon the quality and style of translation...."}

Her village is left with a grey, gloomy day and fear disaster. Il Bora, a magnificent winged creature, finds himself in a difficult position.

Aria must then set out on a quest to find the Sacred Flower. \n They are two different beings that have a lot to overcome and conquer if they are ever to be together. The descriptions in this story are well done. I had a clear picture of where this story took place and of the characters. I liked the story but I would have liked the book to have been a lot longer.

{"text": "I had really high hopes for this book. I mean what's not to love about dragons? I am a huge dragon lover and any book I will read eagerly. That said, this book was a huge disappointment for myself. \n Here's why: \n From page one I felt as if I was thrown into a book/series that I had obviously failed to catch up on. It felt like there was a huge backstory that I wasn't a part of. Think of it as if you were reading Harry Potter but started on book 5, you'd be lost. Sure, the author reveals bits and pieces but that lost feeling never truly went away. \n To add to the lost feeling, I almost felt as if the characters were tossed at me and not really developed. I never got to bond with them. Again, I was left feeling as if I had missed out on something by not reading something before hand. \n Sadly, the lost feeling that I had during the whole book overtook any plot that might have been with the book so I can't tell you much about that. I just couldn't shake the lost feeling enough to enjoy teh rest of the book. \n There were also a few sections that were very oddly worded or developed. To the point that I had to reread them to understand them. I don't know if it was the lost feeling that contributed to this or if it was just oddly worded. \n I really wish I could have had a better experience. Maybe it was my expectations, maybe it just wasn't the book for me, I'm not sure. I didn't give the book a one because, well I didn't HATE it I just was sadly disappointed by the whole experience."}
{"text": "I received Aisuru on NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. \n Crosspost: TheReadingBelle.com \n Honestly, I didn't know what to expect of Aisuru. I haven't seen many reviews on the internet, but I decided to go ahead and read it. What got me to read the book was the synopsis since it sounded like a blend of contemporary and fantasy. I was intrigued by the characters, especially Sakura. Aisuru reminded me a bit of Inuyasha and Kamisama Hajimemashita, just the whole human-yokai romantic relationship, but that's just it. \n What I was expecting was an action-paced book filled with a lot of magical scenarios and political drama. Now what I got was different than what I expected. It was good, but it wasn't bad. I was a tad disappointed that most of the book focused on Hakodate, Japan rather than the magical kingdom of Throklana. \n Alright, basic plot of the book is that Sakura is dying and has less than a year of life left. Sakura tries to be an ice queen to those around her. Most of her classmates have invented rumors about her due to her cold personality. Though Sakura puts on an act, she is actually sweet and caring. She has hidden her illness from everyone; she wants to be treated like a normal girl. She wants to do many things in her life, but knows she can't achieve those goals. When I was reading Sakura's pov, I did tear up. Sakura was very accepting of her fate in the beginning of the story. As chapters progressed, it became harder for her to accept her death. Though Sakura has little character growth in the book, she at least tried to live as a normal girl. She got to accomplish some of her goals on her bucket list. One of my favorite moments of the book was the introduction of Sakura's classmates that eventually became her friends. I have to say that this book did really great when it came to friendship. \n I was actually surprised that this book was a bit dark at some times. Sakura's past was extremely sad, especially what happened to her parents. Though she was adopted into a loving home after the traumatizing events of her childhood, she grew up mostly independent. That's one thing that I really liked about Sakura, she always did her best no matter her limitations. \n Moving on to Kazuki, I felt okay about him. Kazuki is the yokai prince who is supposed to take over the kingdom while his father is on his pilgrimage. Kazuki never wanted to be king. He is the oldest sibling, but he knows that his younger brother is far more capable of being the next crown king. The author didn't really give a great description of his features besides his long claws and white hair. So I imagined him like this that whole time: \n Though Tomoe is a far more better character than Kazuki, just saying. \n Kazuki was a good guy, but a horrible leader. Here's the thing: his kingdom is in turmoil and his brother turned against him. What does Kazuki do? Reside in the human realm and leaves his kingdom in hands of his advisors. He abandoned the throne, and though his duty is to the kingdom, he never really does anything to contribute anything. I can see why he is fascinated with the human world, but it annoyed me that it wasn't till 75% of the book that he decided to take action. As I've mentioned, he was a good guy...he did have some cute moments especially with Karasu. Now Karasu was one of my favorite characters in the story. He is a yokai as well and very devoted to his master. He initially hates Sakura and doesn't trust her whatsoever. I found Karasu to be an adorable jealous little brother. He had a sad backstory that I wish got expanded more! \n Anyways, I thought that Aisuru was going have a lot of action, but I got more of a contemporary vibe. Most of the book was spent on Kazuki and Sakura doing normal errands such as cleaning, or cooking. It seemed that this was going to be a book filled with insta-love, but I am glad that the author tried to build up the romance. There wasn't much tension between the two characters and the kiss happened out of nowhere. \n As for the whole plot, I thought it could have been great if there was no conflict in the yokai realm. Since most of the book took place in the human realm, it felt a bit too much to have two conflicts because Sakura was the main focus throughout the book. The conflict in Kazuki's realm was ignored till the end!! But, despite Aisuru's flaws, I did find myself enjoying the book. The book did have a villain! Surprise, surprise it wasn't the brother. I assumed it was another character...since the villain didn't get introduced till 50% of the book. I won't give much away, but just wow. \n What I liked: \n - Sakura's pov \n -Karasu \n - The ending was cute \n I feel that Aisuru could have made a good graphic novel since the author is inspired by Japanese culture. I was mostly thinking of anime when reading this book! \n Final Rating: [?][?][?] (3.5)"}
{"text": "See full review for Destined for an Early Grave at: http://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.w... \n Cat finally got her happy ending. She quit her special FBI team to live her life with her husband Bones. They've been traveling the world, enjoying their honeymoon. But she forgets that whenever she's happy something is just around the corner to screw it up. And this thing comes in the form of dreams. She's been having nightmares lately where she's running from Death and almost into the arms of a vampire who isn't Bones. She thinks they're just dreams, but Bones and Menchares know better. \n The dreams she's having are being sent to her by a vampire named Gregor, a Dreamsnatcher - if Cat touches him in her dreams she will be snatched away in the real world to wherever he is. So why has he taken an interest in her? Well, apparently when she was sixteen Gregor came for her, having visions of the awesomeness that she would be capable of, and whisked her away to France for two months. The problem is, Cat doesn't remember this time with him, and that's because Menchares wiped her memories of that time, which he shouldn't have done. Gregor is making a claim on her now, saying that he is her true husband and not Bones. To say that it causes problems between Bones and Cat is a massive understatement."}

{"text": "I never expected to find such accurate review of this book. I just finished it and funny thing it left me bitter and blue. I can't stress enough how much I agree with you on what you wrote, it soothed my feelings and for that I'm gratefull. The book was so inconsistent. The author showing some parts of plot then setting them aside for another. It was annoying to follow the book as a whole. I also didn't really like the characters. There were times when the author could stop showing some of them and focus on the others. Whereas I usually hate people (I know from earlier work) to act out of character I was really fond of Giddon. The guy stole my heart and I can't seem to shake off the feeling I got in the first half of the book that he and Bitterblue would be a really good match, very Cashore-like if I may add. I was angry with development of Saf's. The book ends without properly ending leaving me frustrated until I start to search for reviews and find out I wasn't the only one sad by ruining potentially good story (it hurts more to see wasted potential than to see a book bad from the start). I was angry the author put a lot of scenes with characters acting out of character. Only Giddon proved it not to be a complete mistake. In his case it wasn't. But there were a lot of characters I liked for themselves and they didn't get enough time in my opinion. Death was very \"sparky\" if I were to say. His every interaction with Queen was priceless. If he'd been any younger I'd also vote for him to be male lead and a partner to the Queen. I didn't think all that much about romance though. Lately I found myself hating any romances but it made me sad that even though Sapphire started out nicely he ended up being... I don't know what, distraction? Reason for Bitterblue's maddness? I can't explain his role at all since it seemed to me that he was just put in few scenes to make things more spicey and to mess with Bitterblue's poor mind even more. The girl was overall stunning in her ability to stay sane even though there was so much happening. I can't shake off the feeling she was the biggest fool in all of this. I could understand of course she was young, protected and there were wiser people plotting against her. Her childhood and heritage not making it any easier for her. Nevertheless her sudden change and impulse to go out into the city was unbelievable. Her trust and actions... It wasn't downright insane and stupid but during the whole book I couldn't stop thinking that it just doesn't feel right. I didn't see much resemblance to Fire though. A lot of you did, and that's probably understandable, but I read Fire long time ago and just recently I finished Graceling. I can't say I was thrilled with it but I liked it, even though I honestly hate Katsa. Reading Bitterblue right after gave me a strange feeling about the characters that appeared in other books before. I don't expect much of Katsa but after 8 years of being together they probably could act a little bit more mature. Although Bitterblue actually made me realise that Katsa is really mentally broken and there's something terribly wrong with her aside from her Grace. Her childhood implies what was wrong but still. One thing lady Cashore is good at is actually making people act very realistically and all the mental issues seem very real. Especially compared with other books where characters just move on without any problems and as if some issues didn't exist at all. They are all damaged by it, and they all struggle to keep their sanity. But just because I understand that and admire reality of it doesn't mean I can stand interactions of Katsa and Po. They just act like kids and there's not much I can say about it, especiallyu when we were getting ANOTHER kissing scene. Good grief... I also didn't like the lenght of the book, it would feel better if it was split into two books, probably giving more room for some parts of the story to be covered more carefully. I'd enjoy story of a Queen realising her own ignorance and inability to be a good ruler without knowing her kingdom inside out but what we got wasn't resembling anything of the sort. It tried in the end, but it wasn't enough for me. Also I can't help thinking all dialouges were cryptic and wrong, people kept asking wrong questions and actually only Giddon was satisfying character. Saf had potential but it was Giddon that felt right the most. I'm glad to read Fire first, then Graceling and then Bitterblue, it made much more sense this way."}

They aren't overly written or bloated with metaphors, but I felt oddly disconnected throughout most of this collection.

Like I said, I enjoyed a couple of the stories but none of them stuck with me each time I put this down. The best of the bunch is the title story, in which a woman repeatedly cuts her boyfriend in half. Being the first story in the collection, it sadly went down hill for me after that."}

Neil Gaiman brings his own what I can only call \"Neil Gaiman-ness\" to Norse mythology and I loved every minute of it. What pushed this from something I really enjoyed to something I absolutely loved was the way that he narrates his audiobooks. He is a truly gifted storyteller. I felt like I was a kid and I had a favorite uncle reading to me. And I mean that in the non--creepiest way possible. His love of storytelling and myths really shines through and it's contagious. He tells these stories with heart and humor and that little something that is uniquely his. \n Loved it."}
{"text": "This book suffers from a major middle book issue. Although there is action there are parts where this book just drags till no end. It felt like there was an overwhelming amount of description of camp life and added romance fluff to make this book longer. \n With that said, I really enjoyed the setting and the magic starting to grow a bit. I know this book is essential to tying the first and third book together but I feel as though I could have done with a whole book on the ghosts of the camp and the Bootzaman thing. I'm not anticipating a huge battle or a fight there was no build up to the third book so I was a bit disappointed in that. \n I did like the historic cameos and the ghost plot. And I loved the part about Washington and the flag, but really I think this book could have been a bit shorter and I would have enjoyed it a lot more."}

They are each other's half and incomplete without the other. \n More characters are introduced and you learn more about the Irin/Irina way of living. Intricately written, emotionally powerful, this one will leave you just as breathless as the first book. That epilogue didn't just slam a door open, it broke a dam for questions to flow through. While the ending didn't sit on a huge cliffhanger like in the first book, I'm still flabbergasted. Where is this going? Even as we have a name, the real identity is unknown. Is it who I think it is?

To sum up, because we don't waste too many words: Horns is the story of a young man that wakes up one morning, a year after his love was raped and murdered, to discover a pair of horns growing out of his skull. In particularly, I kind of enjoyed the fact that the Devil can be a superhero in the right light."}
{"text": "This book was intensely horrifying and I'm glad I finished it. I've never been a fan of horror/thriller stories but this book has been sitting in my TBR list and I figured that it was time to crash this one out. I started this book months ago but was unable to continue because I became busy with school. I reopened it the day before yesterday and just this morning, I finished it. \n I loved it. It was really scary especially when you read it at night which was what I did that's why I got goose bumps and had trouble sleeping. The story was unique because I haven't read anything like it before. The characters were awesome and the way the writer relayed the story was just magnificent. \n Cas was really likeable and so is Anna, though I really got scared when I got to read what she can do. The character I liked least was Will. UGH. Every time I get to read that he is in the scene, I just get this feeling that I want to kill him myself. Though I felt sorry for him when he was killed, I felt kind of relieved that he was. (Am I bad? HAHA) Another character I liked was Cas' mom, she was really supportive even though she knows that something bad would happen to his son. She trusts him so much, and that's what I liked about her. \n The setting of the story was surreal but believable. Anna's background story was heartbreaking and everything was just perfect. Though I gave it a four star, I really recommend it to those who want to have a good scare, read a weird love story and loves fantasy."}

But then the next book doesn't focus on this story, but on two other people. So I kind of feel like I'm hanging by my fingernails, waiting for the next Ash, Seth, Keenan book to come out. Not a bad read, though. I enjoyed it."}

Some of them are rather bland, but most of them are quite good. Several in particular have such romantic, poetic language that they are a joy to read. Ironically, Bram Stoker's short story finishes off the collection, despite being (in my opinion) one of its weaker offerings. The contrast between vampirism represented in different cultures and styles was interesting, from Russian folklore to English horror stories. Also included is a fascinating chapter on vampires in general, which was full of interesting information. Fun read!"}

That question could not be answered -- it simply WAS. \n Franny, Jet, and Vincent have always felt that they were different, but full self awareness only came one summer spent at their Aunt Isabel's home in Massachusetts. There, they come to learn that self acceptance was as important as love for a happy and fulfilled existence. For centuries, the Owens women are taught that love is a burden, that falling in love carries deadly risks, but that a life without love is a small death in itself. It takes a lifetime to learn that the only cure for love is to love more. \n \"The Rules of Magic\" is really Franny's story. She is the strongest of the Owens siblings and also the most stubborn, and certainly the most resistant to letting others into her heart. She dubs herself the \"woman of thorns\" and her heart is impenetrable, except for the love she feels for her two siblings. Even her childhood sweetheart, Haylin, can't break through the walls she puts up. Is it self preservation or self destruction? Or is she really the most loving because she thinks this fortress will protect those she loves most? \n But the reader comes to love Franny. And seeing her journey gives you insight into how she became the way she is, and how her legacy being passed on to Sally and Gillian (in Practical Magic) was destiny. \n This book was a pleasure to read. No one weaves a tale quite like Alice Hoffman. I can't wait to read my next Hoffman book!"}
{"text": "I felt that this novel was a book within a book. It accounts a (fake) tale from the author Goldman and his commentary over his favourite (and fictional) book. \n He talks about the significance of this book throughout his life as his father read it to him growing up. He then bought the book for his son, only to find out Goldman's father only read his son the good parts. This prompted Goldman to claim the rights to the book to rewrite it as he remembers it to preserve what made the book so great growing up. \n The book Goldman loves so much was the Princess Bride. It was full of adventure, sword fights and danger. \n I found Goldman's commentary to compliment the book and I even enjoyed his own backstory. At first I wasn't interested in Goldman's history and wants to focus on the Princess Bride, but eventually I was won over."}

{"text": "Review originally posted on journeyintotheshelves.tumblr.com & journeyintotheshelves.wordpress.com. \n **I received an ARC of this book courtesy of Penguin Random House at BEA 2015. This has had no bearing on this review. \n Soundless follows the story of Fei who lives in a remote mining village at the top of a mountain where everyone is deaf. Fei's village depends on trade with an unknown group at the bottom of the mountain for food and other materials that they cannot get from their surroundings. When the miners begin to loose their eyesight, the trade becomes lighter and the people in Fei's village begin to starve. When Fei miraculously regains the ability to hear, she realizes that she may be able to help her village from dying. That is, if she can get down the mountain. \n In this magical new story by Richelle Mead, Soundless reimagines a Chinese folktale and brings to life the story of a brave girl in her fight to save everything she knows and loves. \n Unfortunately, I wasn't blown away by this story as much as I wanted to. I have loved all of the books by Richelle Mead that I have read so far, and Soundless was one of my top anticipated books of 2015. \n I was intrigued by the idea of a standalone fantasy novel; I haven't read any - in my memory - and I was interested in seeing how aspects like world building would translate in a standalone. With that said, I think Soundless could have actually been longer, just for the simple fact that I felt like the world was fairly underdeveloped. I didn't really get a feeling of the setting and the atmosphere that Fei and the other characters were living in, which was unique to this novel in the first place. The world building just wasn't there, which was unfortunate. \n The characters were the biggest redeeming part of this novel, and this is where Mead really shines. Fey and her passion for her sister and her determination to help her sister is what drove the story forward and grounded the novel so steeped in folklore. Fei's relationship with Li was also a defining trait of the novel that I actually wanted more of after the novel was over just to see their relationship develop more. \n The pacing of this novel was off. In the beginning, the plot went fairly slowly, and then towards the end - I would say, around the last fifty pages or so - the plot picked up speed quickly that left the ending feel rushed. There was no real balance to the book. The plot of this novel was great - an intriguing concept with beautiful storytelling - but the pacing detracted from it. \n Overall, Soundless explores a realm of folktales that I am not completely familiar with, which was really exciting to read and it did leave me wanting more from this world. However, this novel just seemed to slightly miss the mark."}
{"text": "So about 3/4 through the book I knew what I wanted to rate this book. Now I'm a bit torn. One of the main reasons why I decided to read this book is because of Bardugo's Six of Crows series which was amazing and brilliant. In the back of my mind I'm wishing I had read this series before Six of Crows but the fact that this book came out before Six of Crows I'll try not to be as harsh. I throughly enjoyed the book until 3/4ths which is when it slowed down for me a bit too much. There were points that were too predictable for me and I'm not a huge fan of Mal. At first I liked him but I feel more drawn towards the Darkling. Don't get me wrong. I did enjoy this book and I would recommend it but I would advise people to read this book series before Six of Crows. I will definitely continue this series."}

Whist watching the earth he receives his call to service and descends to earth but the call hasn't come from his master, but from a female witch. \n Serenity has been dumped and left heart broken my her ex boyfriend Edward, using her magic she calls for an Angels help to exact revenge. When Apollyon appears and offers to help her the two join forces to make Edward jealous and feel the same loss and heartbreak she has felt. Straight away there is a connection, instant attraction and sexual tension between the two lead characters. The story is quite a simple one, and one I'm sure any girl can relate to, I could have done with an Apollyon myself on a couple of occasions. The lack of fast paced action or twisting story plot lines only made me enjoy the sexy budding connection between Apollyon and Serenity more. \n My only bad point was I got to 84% on my Kindle and it said the end !! I wanted more !! Instead we were given a sneak preview of the next book in the series which I had already bought, I can totally understand why authors do this but still the fact I wanted more is a good sign and I will defiantly be reading more in the series :o)"}
{"text": "Audiobook read by the author. \n Space Magic is a collection of short stories by David D. Levine that are either Science Fiction, Fantasy, or some combination of those together. I have to admit that I really enjoyed this short story collection. Short stories in general sometimes feel underdeveloped or trivial, but the stories in this collection do a great job of introducing a whole new world, what's going on, and coming to a satisfying conclusion. If you like SciFi/Fantasy of any kind, this is a great collection of stories. \n Here were some of my more favorite stories: \n Nucleon - This was like Mr. Magorium's wonder imporium at a junkyard. A fun concept and likeable characters. \n Zauberschrift - Really cool story about a scribe who used to apprentice with feuding wizards needs to help a village plagued by bad magic. Really cool magic ideas and insights into mob mentality. \n Rewind - This story really reminded me of Equilibrium in how you have someone from an elite force of some totalitarian government join in with the rebellion with his super abilities/powers. So many possibilities in this story. \n Brotherhood - A great story of the labor force in their struggles with the man that will have you wondering why it's in this collection for most of the story...(in a good way) \n Tk'Tk'Tk - This story takes the problems of a salesman selling to a different culture to the extreme. What if you were an interstellar salesman coping with the cultures of another species you could barely understand? \n Charlie the Purple Giraffe Was Acting Strangely - This story is crazy. What happens to comic characters between the cells and between the comics? \n The Ecology of Faerie - This story is like Faerie horror. I don't know how Mr. Levine did it, but he made a Faerie story like Night of the Living dead and it's awesome! \n Audiobook: David D. Levine does his own reading for this book. He does a pretty decent job with the reading although not being a professional reader. You wouldn't necessarily be missing anything if you decided to read this rather than audiobooking but good luck pronouncing the stuff in Tk'Tk'Tk..."}
{"text": "\"In all your life, your only choice is the path of needles or the path of pins.\" \n Crimson Bound is a fantasy novel, which is loosely inspired on Little Red Riding Hood and is reminiscent of the dark atmosphere which is present in the original Grimm fairy tales. \n I love fairy tale retellings so when I found out that Crimson Bound was a retelling of the classic Red Riding Hood tale, with a dark and magical twist, I knew that I was in for a treat. Rosamund Hodge has successfully managed to create a whole new tale with slight nods to the Little Red Riding Hood tale by giving it a life of its own. \n The hardcover copy is a work of art. I really loved the cover artwork and the matching pine branch pattern on the book cover underneath the cover artwork. The colour scheme and artwork matched perfectly with the themes in this book. The world building of this book is quite fascinating and the setting is either heavy influenced or based in medieval France, with heavy references to french folklore, the names of the characters and the locations. It does help that Hodge has a way with words and it is very easy to visualise the gorgeous locations that feature in this book. \n We experience the story through the eyes of Rachelle, a girl whose sole obsession is to defeat the Devourer, the main antagonist of this book. I will try not to reveal much, but at a young age, Rachelle is careless and makes some grave choices which will haunt her for the rest of her life. Throughout the book, we experience Rachelle battling with her guilt and her life's mission to atone for her sins of the past. I did enjoy the fact that Hodge managed to create a heroine who is complex and deeply flawed. However this does not come off as a surprise since all the supporting characters are well fledged and complex. \n The only thing I can complain about this book was the romance aspect, especially the love triangle and the insta-love which felt forced to me and as if it was shoved in the reader's face. However it wasn't something that would discourage me from reading this book since it was just one aspect of this book and overall I really did enjoy this well crafted retelling."}

{"text": "Rereading the whole series was far overdue. This book is great. An easy read, but not childishly simplified like so many YA books. I do wish the publishers hadn't tried to Americanize the text so much. It's ok for British characters to use British terms."}
{"text": "Even a 5 star rating seems woefully inadequate praise for this spectacular book. I am in awe of Bancroft's skill and creativity. A book this perfect almost feels like it sprung from the brain of an alien far more advanced than a regular human. I am just stunned that this book exists. \n I started reading this this morning and once I picked it up I didn't put it down until dinner time when I realized all I had eaten over the course of the day was some handfuls of goldfish crackers because I was too transfixed to eat. I reluctantly stepped away to feed myself and picked this up again and read until I finished as soon as I had washed my hands post meal. \n As I gush in more detail about how amazing this book is I want to re-emphasize that, as effusive as I'm being, my words will inevitably fail to do this book justice, it is that fucking phenomenal. \n I want to start by talking about Bancroft's facility with language. His Goodreads bio says he is a poet. I don't read poetry ever (my husband used to write poetry and I read and enjoyed his but since he gave it up years ago I can't remember the last time I read a poem) but I can see the value the author's background as a poet brought to this work. I can tell you his prose is beautiful enough that you will stop, pause and re-read passages just because of how the language soars. I am usually not a very visual reader. I don't frequently paint mental pictures of what I'm reading as I read however Bancroft's writing is so vivid and evocative that I really felt like I could see, hear, smell and taste each ring of the tower. It was impossible not to experience this world like I was really there. \n Plot-wise this manages to feel totally fresh and weird while also feeling totally authentic. Senlin experiences some capital C craziness on his journey but I never thought \"this doesn't feel right\" or \"this isn't believable.\" Every plot development feels earned, and the world building is so thorough and smart that the reader is able to totally buy into Bancroft's universe. If I had to compare this to anything, I would compare it to the movie Snowpiercer (which I also loved) in how it well it sells its bold, visionary world. \n Character development is uniformly top notch. Every character, major or minor, is nuanced and fascinating and compelling. \n It is a crying shame that this only has 100 or so ratings on Goodreads. I hope it soon earns the popularity it so richly deserves. This is everything a book should be. I'm not one of those people that has a big Goodreads following or anything. I write reviews for myself and assume most of the time I am the only person who reads them but anyone else reading this, I implore you to buy this book and give it a shot. You won't be sorry."}

{"text": "This is a world of great depth; it's obvious author Fuyumi Ono has planned our discovery of the Twelve Kingdoms. Fans of the anime will find this first novel of the series a bit slow, as the anime seems to have condensed the story to fit several novels in each season, but first-time readers will enjoy this first tour of this exotic world. \n The weak point of this story is Yoko's lingering experience in the wilderness; it felt a bit like Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, in the sense of dragging too long through misery in the wilderness. That is why I gave this only 3 stars, but I confess I might have been swayed by experiencing the condensed version first. But the rich development of the world compensates for the slower progress, and I will seek out the next in the series."}
{"text": "Every once in a while I read a book that I can't say enough good things about. Lately I've read some good books, but none have lingered in the corners of my mind. But this book... this one has done it. \n I'd call this a light fantasy. The world is very similar to ours in a sense, with humans and animals and a seemingly normal world around them with the same seasons and landscapes. The Graced, people with extraordinary abilities in a certain skill, are what set the world apart from ours. It's a primitive, medieval-type lifestyle, pretty common in many of the fantasies I've read. This story is about Katsa, a king's niece, who possesses the Grace of killing. \n But it doesn't read too much like a fantasy novel. I've encountered books hundreds of pages long with tedious descriptions and world-building. This book had the perfect amount of both, and though some criticized the author's world-building, I found I didn't need all of the extras to make it work. \n The author writes very well and rather simply. Her style allows you to flow through the chapters effortlessly as if you are experiencing them firsthand, which makes for a quick read. I read this in about 6 hours total reading time. That's always a bonus! \n But the stars of this magical novel are truly the characters. I'm a fan of strong women leads, not because I'm a feminist, but because they are interesting characters to read about. No one wants a boring, whiney, wimpy chick leading the way. And Katsa is probably my favorite female lead EVER. Which is a lot to say, because if you know me then you know I am a huge Hunger Games fan and pretty much wish I could meet Katniss for real. I think Katsa actually topped Katniss (there must be something with \"Kat\" names) in that she felt her purpose and moved along with the story intentionally, rather than survived her ordeal. I'm not downing Katniss by the way, because she was an amazing survivor in her story, but that's how incredible Katsa is. \n She is Graced with the ability to kill. And she does. But, she's not a ruthless, cold-blooded girl, which could have easily been the direction the author went. Instead, she gives Katsa realistic weaknesses and vulnerabilities, such as the developing ability to control her temper and standing up to her uncle, King Randa, when he wants her to perform his dirty deeds in the kingdom. She's not unkind or foul, but rather a product of her upbringing, and I love the complexity to her character. \n Po is wonderful also. He seems a little soft, but he's also very strong. He is Graced with the ability to fight, and when Po and Katsa meet, they have some incredibly charged interactions. He's intuitive and sensitive to others, yet brave, strong, and level headed. \n The supporting characters are well rounded, and I fell in love with Raffin and Oll and Bitterblue. \n I love when a book feels believable. Not in the sense of that it could actually happen, but that the characters are fleshed out and consistent enough that their dialogue, actions, and interactions seem so natural that it would appear they were modeled from real people. This book has a little romance in it, but I LOVED it. I liked Katniss and Peeta also, but again, I think that Katsa and Po are just that much more electrifying. No insta-love here people, it's a well developed and heartfelt bond shared. \n And the secrets about their Graces... great revelations. Po has a secret, and Katsa discovers her true Grace. Together, this team is unstoppable, and it made for a truly exciting read. \n If I absolutely had to find something to gripe about, it would be the travelling. They did a lot of it. It sagged a little in the middle, but the sag was pretty well supported with great character building and more world-building, plus development of relationships between characters. \n The author was criticized by some for Katsa's character and the depiction of her as a woman in the story. I don't see what the fuss was about, and I'm not even sure why she was picked on about it. I guess some people have more extreme feminist views when it comes to how a woman should or shouldn't be portrayed in a story. Personally, Katsa is incredibly strong and independent. Maybe it was her decision to **gasp** have sex with Po. Just because she wasn't married, and never wants to, the author was criticized. I've seen far worse things exploited in books (Lolita, anyone?), and if you want to get into YA examples of weak or \"bad example\" lead characters, check out The Forest of Hands and Teeth, or Twilight . Katsa is great. I'll let the haters hate I guess, and just keep rooting her on myself. I wonder who the Katsa's critics root for. \n This is a book I will read again. I'm so glad I bought a hard copy of it, because I will read it over and over. And recommend it to everyone I know. I am still thinking about this book and about how this review doesn't do it justice whatsoever. Katsa and Po... just wonderful. Great debut novel."}
{"text": "I am not writing a review for this book because the sole reason I'm reading it is to waste time and have a good laugh. \n But I wanted to point out one little thing that really bugged me... \n \"He didn't remember hardly anything...\" \n This quote was taken directly from the published (finished) work. It is very clearly a double negative. Did she mean to say he remembers everything? No. She meant he barely remembered anything (why didn't she just say that? No idea) \n This author is a CREATIVE WRITING teacher! \n I feel like ANYONE who teaches English and Literature should know to avoid double negatives! Or at least to use them properly! \n If I was her boss and read this book, I would fire her for simply being an awful teacher and leading a bad example. The language in these books is atrocious, filled with stupid mistakes no educated person should make. \n Bet the bitch is tenured. \n And don't get me started on what kind of awful publisher would publish this kind of horse shit. How about editing it a bit? How about making it READABLE. \n I am so angry that books like these get published while great novels are cast aside. Even Fifty Shades of Gray and Twilight were EDITED. \n WHAT THE FUCK."}

{"text": "When I finished reading the last page and closed the book, what were my immediate reactions-- ????? Hmmm. That's exactly what I said. \n Do I love Lauren Oliver's writing? Yes. \n Do I love the idea of spindlers, nocturnis, nids, troglods and a rat with makeup? Of course! \n I loved the ideas and Lauren Oliver describes Below beautifully, but I guess I was left feeling like everything was very easy and the entire last page explained a moral. Parts of it, like when Liza keeps repeating \"It's not fair!\" and twice (which is super repetitive for a 250 page book) she was being distracted from her 'mission' by food and promises of a better life, were very reminiscent of Labyrinth. In a way that's fitting because she gives credit to Maurice Sendak in her acknowledgements, but I guess I really wanted more action and a bit more of a surprise. \n On a whole, yes, I liked it, but I didn't love it and I'm not sure if I'd buy it."}

{"text": "*I got this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review \n \"There's no magic more powerful than the human spirit\" \n Set in an alternate modern world, some people possess powers, Skill, and some don't. Whereas in most parts of the world that doesn't matter, in the United Kingdom those who have power rule, those who don't have to give ten years of their lives to slavery. Common folk are given the option of either applying to work those ten years in slavetowns or at Equal's, those with Skill, estates. \n Abi tried to get her whole family to work at an estate instead of a slavetown, as the rumours said those in such towns lead ten brutal years void of joy. Although Abi managed to get most of the family accepted at the Jardine's, the founding family of the system in UK, estate, her brother was placed in Millmoor, a slavetown near Manchester, where the family was from. But a revolution was brewing long before Luke's arrival at Millmoor. With his family way, Luke feels lonely and his hope to rejoin his family ebbs away with time, so when he gets a proposition to join a rebellious group in Millmoor, Luke accepts. At the Jardine's estate, Abi finds herself falling in love for one of the sons of the most powerful Equal in UK while she slowly uncovers some of the family's secrets, which changes her perception of the Equals. \n Although set in modern England, it didn't feel like it until very far into the book. There was never any mention of phones, computers, internet, or any other technology which define our generation and time. The only mentions that could tell you it is set in modern England is the existence of cars, television and technology to read chips and ID electronic cards. \n However, the two things that bothered me the most were the ridiculous amount of characters that the reader had to remember right in the first book and the ridiculous names of the Equals. Instead of overwhelming the readers with so many characters it would have made more sense to make us care more about the two main characters, which I don't think it was well achieved. And if the idea to give the Equals names which sounded posh or rare, stick to the ones given to royalty nowadays, like Charles and Henry, they already carry a certain connotation which would get your idea across without resorting to names like Silyen and Meilyr. Most names sounded out of a high fantasy book set in a whole different world, which is not a good thing in my opinion. \n The idea is definitely great and it does have a lot of potential to have a great sequel. The first book had a lot of political intrigue and, although most of the plot twists were quite predictable (I had figured them all out long before they had happened), there are some very complex handful of characters which I thought was refreshing. I particularly liked Silyen, Meilyr and Luke. I liked Bouda but only because she struck me as a very strong female character that knows what she wants. \n Although it can be improved, I think Gilded Cage is a great start for an intriguing story with a lot of political conflict and revolutions. I'm definitely looking forward to the sequel. \n Blog . Instagram . Twitter ."}

{"text": "I really think this book was mismarketed. It was presented as a \"teen\" book and really it was written and read like a book that would be ideal for readers of 8-10. That being said I shall continue on. \n I really enjoyed the idea of a story being told from a toads POV. After all, everyone always wondered what the toad who was being put into the witch's brew is thinking (admit it you have thought about it). However, this book is sadly lacking. Here's why. \n First, the book seemed to throw mysterious, dangerous creatures at the main character for no apperent reason. Instead of developing any sense of character the book focused on \"Wow look at this dangerous animal....\" and \"Run we're being attacked by ______\". That worked a few times but after a while it was predictable and boring meeting new mysterious creatures. \n It almost feels as if the author went \"What quirky situation can I toss a character in and just went ahead and mysteriously had them thrown into that type of situation. \n Second, the constant throwing of new creatures prevented any plot from forming. I was more than half way through the book and I was still going \"And the plot is....... \". There wasn't any. \n Third, the witches are randomly thrown in and even after reading I was still left wondering about them. They would mysteriously appear in the book but they were grossly underdeveloped both character and plot wise. \n I do have to say the drawings in this book are WONDERFUL. Probably the best part of the book and had I been an 8/9 year old I probably would have loved this book, it just didn't work out for myself and it was rather disappointing."}

{"text": "I asked for Shiver for Christmas a few years ago because it was raved about quite a bit. I thought it was a pretty good read. I read Linger months later, and liked it quite a bit more than Shiver (the world of Sam and Grace had already been built so there was more room for action). \n I read Forever and liked it five times more than Linger because it was AMAZING. \n I guess now would be the time for me to admit that for the first 25 pages of Forever I was utterly, totally confused. Forever is from four points of view, and so much happened at the end of Linger that I couldn't keep it all straight in my head. I ended up having to read a spoilery review of Linger to get the gist of it all flowing the right way in my head again (so I strongly suggest you reread or do a little research before starting this one). \n Maggie Stiefvater's writing is simply beautiful. Even those that didn't care much for Shiver commented on how wonderful her writing is, and she does not disappoint in the final installment of The Wolves of Mercy Falls. It jumps us right to where Linger left off, and from there we are right back with Grace, Isabel, Sam, and Cole. \n The middle of Forever got a little long for me, but that's my only complaint. The last third of the book flew by and had my heart pounding. Steifvater doesn't use predictable outcomes to satisfy the reader, which was my favorite part - she wrote this book in a real, true way, and it resonated with me as a reader. \n It's not often that I love the last book in a series much much more than the others, but there is no denying that Forever surpasses both Shiver and Linger in my mind."}
{"text": "See full review for Rapture at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n Lucinda Price now knows the truth about most of her past lives. Thanks to some Announcer jumping and almost changing the past, she at least has a better idea of what drew Daniel and her together time and time again. The only thing she still isn't sure of is how to break the curse that was put upon her. But that has to take a backseat, because while she was jumping through these Announcers, she had a guide named Bill who seemed to help, yet at the last second he turned out to be the last person Luce was ever expecting. Lucifer. Due to the decision she made not to kill her cursed soul, Lucifer has decided that he can't leave things up to Fate anymore, so he is going back to the Fall and this time he's going to make sure things go in his favor. \n The only way to stop him, though, is to find the location of the Fall, and you would think with all the angels that Luce runs with these days they would be able to find it no problem. But, of course, they can't because they don't remember the Fall all that well. However, hope is not lost (or else there would be no plot to this book, naturally) because of the book that Daniel wrote hundreds of years ago, he has some clue as to how they can find the location. It lies in three relics and when they are brought together they should reveal the information that they seek. But, they only have nine days to find them and stop Lucifer from rewriting history. And somewhere along the line, Luce has to figure out why they've been cursed and why exactly Lucifer is so keen on her... \n Okay, so after the mediocre way that Luce found out the truth about her past lives and love for Daniel, I wasn't expecting to much from this book. Which I guess is a good thing, because I was kind of taken away with Rapture."}

{"text": "As all of the Game of Thrones books are, this novel keeps the reader glued to the pages until the final sentences. Some chapters are trying, however you grow to appreciate them as the plot develops and they link in."}
{"text": "Also on our blog:http://thebooknatics.blogspot.com/ \n Check it out? :) \n I have always been fascinated with the studies of mythology, Greek being the top of my favorites! I get so giddy when I get my hands on reads such as this! It has to be the thrill of living fictionally and vicariously in the eyes of a modern day girl who has the opportunity to experience every geek-girls mythical God dream! \n I have to start off by saying, Rosanna Leo certainly is charming, and it shines through her writing radiantly! Her characters are full of SO much life, and the dialogue between characters will have you in giggling fits. And I know I am not the first to say, but I undoubtedly identified with Maia, (our lead character) and that bond/connection is one of the best affairs for a reader to experience. She's pretty awkward, but she's deeply passionate about the things and people she keeps close, has her own sense of style of clothing choice and not a care what people think of it, and just so much more, I adore her! \n Maia works as a conservator and expert in the Ancient Greek department of a Museum she grew up in as her father had worked there. Ever since she was five years old, she had a strange infatuation for a particular statue, her favorite piece which began her peculiar crush on the mythical Greek God of love, Eryx. She even swore it would wink at her at times and found herself speaking to the statue as if it were an actual person. Maia grows up to be an intelligent and devoted woman, a true expert on everything Greek. The story takes an interesting turn for Maia when the new Museum director, Lord Eric, arrives and has a striking semblance to the man of her dreams. (Literally) \n She thinks she must be going crazy, it couldn't possibly be him. He's only myth...right? As soon as he arrives, the department is being turned upside down, and layoffs are happening left and right. Maia fears she may be next, but Lord Eric begins to act strange around her. Almost as if this insanely gorgeous man... was attracted to her? Maia feels like she really must be going insane. She's so clouded by her insecurities she can't comprehend the fantasy becoming reality, and as we find out Lord Eric can't even explain why he's so drawn to her. He proves to her his identity and romance buds right before our eyes, but when we the reader least expect it, the plot really thickens. \n A sick and deranged Goddess has it out for Eryx, beholding an ancient grudge. She will do whatever it takes to separate the lovers to leave Eryx's heart in shambles forever. The thrill is edge-of-your-seat intense, leaving you rooting and praying for everything to turn out alright between the star-crossed lovers. \n As a lover of mythology and romantic affairs, Leo did not disappoint. It's everything I imagined for a modern day woman who lives with her head in the clouds, who ever had a wish for something she so desired to come true. Oh, if only we could all have our own Greek God. \n I really rather not spoil the greatness of this book, so the cryptic last paragraph will just have to do for you till you read it! Believe me when I tell you, fellow mythology nerds, if you love romance with spice and lore, this charismatic book is something you do NOT want to miss. What are you waiting for, go get it! \n http://www.amazon.com/For-Love-God-eb..."}

Almost like we were there with Penryn and we were with her every step of the way. Not to mention the world-construction and the atmosphere-building was *clap clap* applause-worthy. \n And boy, oh boy, did I love love LOVE End Of Days.

{"text": "2.5 stars. \n There's a lot of sex and rape in this book, way more than in Game of Thrones from what I remember. The book started off pretty slow, the whole thing just felt like 1000 pages of set-up/filler with a very small foray into the introduction of magic, barely building upon what was introduced in GOT. The slow pacing of the book and the fact that it seemed like there were a lot of words but not a lot happening makes me want to just start watching the show, books be damned. Honestly, the only reason I'm going to continue reading the series is the sole reason that it's GOT; if it were any other series I would just stop here. \n Also I felt like Tyrion had more than half of the povs in the book, definitely way more than any other character. Tyrion's a cool and interesting character but I was getting a little tired of reading through his povs because he just had so many."}

{"text": "I am a huge fan of Libba Bray and was really excited to start this book. Set in the roaring twenties, Evie O'Neil is the quintessential flapper girl freshly arrived in New York City. Evie is set to live with her Uncle, who runs a museum of superstition and the occult. Evie is ready to take on the city with her best friend Mable, but shortly after she arrives, strange murders begin to occur throughout the city. And Evie has a strange ability that could put her into harm's way. \n I really liked the time period the book was set in a lot, and I liked the vernacular of the characters as a result of that time period. In that respect I think it was really well written. The characters were also really likeable and had very rich backstories, which is something that Bray does very well. Overall I think that there was just too much packed into this book. I liked that it was told in alternating points of view, but I think if the plot was more streamlined and focused I would have enjoyed it a lot more. \n *** \n Re-read fall 2017--I enjoyed it a lot more the second time around!

{"text": "4.5 Magical Stars \n I was given the chance to beta read Melissa's & Nicole's YA Paranormal book and was happy that it turned out to be such a great debut novel. \n Both author's perfectly turned a well-known story into something totally new and gave the book the perfect mixture of magic, suspense, twists, and wth-effects; oh yeah there's sweet love story to find as well ;). I was hooked right at the very beginning of the story, due to the suspense they created - loved it. I was curious how Gwen's life will turn out in an unknown world full of magic; especially after forcing to leave her beloved friends and home behind. \n Hallows Haven creates a solid base and basic understanding for the following books in Melissa's & Nicole's series; with insides of Gwens family line and what happens after Gwen finds out about the family secrets,which were kept hidden,turning her life even more upside down. Who to trust/blame/believe and who not are constant questions in Gwen's mind. \n Gwen realizes during the first weeks living in Hallows Haven that nothing, or better no one is really who they seem to be. That's when her story really begins... \n Be aware the book ends with a great wth moment and I wished I could have squeezed an answer out of both author's, finding out how it continues, because I'm hella curious,but I had no luck. So like you, I have to wait to read the second book. And like me, after reading THIS ending, you definitive want to know how it continues. \n So yes, I recommend it to everyone !"}

{"text": "See full review for In the Afterlight at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n Ruby's world has been turned upside multiple times in her seventeen years. From the time she was ten and survived IANN only to discover her strange ability to see inside a person's mind to when the President bombed Los Angeles to get rid of the Children's League. Now, she has to overcome the LA bombing to get what she really wants - the cure for her abilities. But before she can do that, her and the surviving members of the League have to get the hell out of LA before they starve to death. Not an easy task when the city is crawling with Psi Special Forces just waiting for them to screw up and the agents within their own group who are planning to betray everyone for money and supplies to get out and bomb Washington again. \n Thanks to some subterfuge of their own, Ruby and Cole send those agents packing and make their way to the Ranch - the original HQ of the League - but along the way, Ruby and company pick up a person from their group that they didn't think they'd ever see again, and learn the truth about the cure that is supposed to save them all... \n Here we go again with another sequel that I was wary of, because what are the chances that I would actually like all three books of a trilogy? It's rare, and that meant that something was going to go wrong in this book that would send me through three or four star rating hell. But, I shouldn't have worried, because Bracken is good. She knows how to pick up the story right where we left off with Ruby in LA dealing with the fallout of the bombing and the bombshell that she rescued the notes that Clancy tried to burn to a crisp in the last book. Add in the potential betrayal of their fellow agents and Zu finally making a reappearance and things were set up for a great conclusion. And it was really great."}
{"text": "A world apart is an excellent book. It is a story that covers four generations who grew up in Doves Meadow. The majority of the story though, is about three friends, Demetrius, Eleyna and Halcyon. As kids they form their own gang and challenge each other's skills. As teenagers Demetrius and Eleyna have discovered they love each other but cannot find the courage to tell each other. Due to miscommunication and misunderstanding, Eleyna agrees to marry Halcyon. The choices they make change the course of their lives forever. On the day of their marriage Demetrius leaves Doves Meadow to join the Order, the military government that runs Elecheron. Eleyna and Halcyon start their married life but soon find themselves in a circumstance that brands them as outlaws, murderers. They flee for their lives and end up working on a pirate ship. Due to a twist in fate, unbeknownst to Eleyna and Halcyon, they sidetrack Demetrius's career, sentencing him to the Pit, a sewer infested hole, with other thieves. This story has many twists and turns and some things you know are coming but you don't know how. This is not a quick read, but it is a very interesting one. David has created this whole other world, Elecheron and has done an excellent job of doing just that. I look forward to reading more by this author."}

{"text": "See full review for Crescendo at: http://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.w... \n Recently, Becca Fitzpatrick revealed on Twitter that Crescendo was not her favorite book to write out of the Hush, Hush Saga, and I can tell. When this book first came out, I read it in one day and was supremely confused and angered by the events that transpired. How is it that a sequel to a book that I loved could turn in to such...well, crap? Now, that I've read it again, I still don't have an answer, but I kind of understand things better than that first reading. \n Nora is used to her life being turned upside down. Her father was murdered almost two years ago, she's learned that she is descended from a race called Nephilim, and that her lab partner from biology was a fallen angel until he saved her life two months ago. Now, Patch is a guardian angel her guardian angel and she couldn't be happier. But as the book begins, Nora isn't on the path to normal just yet. Feeling overwhelmed by her feelings for Patch, she declares her love for him and he doesn't say it back. \n The next morning in summer school she learns from Marcie Miller - her arch nemesis for years - that Patch went to her house right afterwards and stood watching. Nora asks Patch about it, but he doesn't give her an answer. Feeling hurt and betrayed she breaks up with him causing a rift. Add in a new character named Scott with a dark past of his own, and the fact that Nora is seeing her father around town and you've got one interesting sequel."}
{"text": "For more reviews, check out Keep Calm and Love Books \n \"No one was my master-- but I might be master of everything, if I wished. If I dared.\" \n Amen. Ok. I've been debating how to express in this review how *excuse my language* FUCKING AMAZING THIS WAS. I don't say this lightly but this might actually be my favourite book I have EVER read. The fact that the ratings for this book is literally 4.77/5 from 19, 818 people's rating on Goodreads is absolutely ridiculous. If that does not tell you to go, either, start this series or read this sequel then I honestly am baffled at your ignorance. I am still in a state of shock from just finishing reading this novel. I read this via iBooks but rest assured, tomorrow (considering it is 4:30 am right now) I will be picking up the hardcopy. Where to begin with this masterpiece? Lets start with the amount of action/love/despair/fighting/capability all stuffed into 624 pages. I've always loved Maas, right from Throne of Glass but wow. She really did outdo herself in this novel. The amount of heart-wrenching despair and strength in this novel is just overwhelming. One of the main reasons it took me from May 3rd till now, May 27th to finish this book; Let me put it into perspective, I finished City of Heavenly Fire by Cassandra Clare, a 725 page book in less than 5 days. DO YOU GET WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY? This book was so jam packed with knowledge and character growth that it took a hell of a long time to read. Also, another reason is because the next book comes out May 4th, 2017. Excuse me? Um, a year. A fucking full year for the next novel.... I don't even think I can physically and/or emotionally do that. I can't begin to tell you guys how amazing the transformation and alliances took place from ACOTAR to ACOMAF. I was definitely team Tamlin in ACOTAR but now..... Hello, when you read this book you'll realize why anyone who says they're not team Rhysand will probably get murdered on sight. Just saying. The fact Maas was able to turn the ferocious team Tamlin group all into team Rhysand is just proof of amazingness. I really do aspire to be an author one day, and I can now say that I will definitely look to Maas and her writing skills that are just impeccable. \n \"I was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal. \n I was a survivor, and I was strong. \n I would not be weak, or helpless again \n I would not, could not be broken. Tamed.\" \n You say it girl! God, Feyre was just such a strong character in this. I'm pretty sure she's stronger than Caelana/Aelin even. Feyre is the epitome of strength and grace all at once. She would be the most fair, just, and glorious queen anyone would worship. Maas wrote this easily manipulated, weak minded girl in ACOTAR who was totally out of place being the minority around everyone and turned her into a strong-willed, fighting badass women who can conquer the world in a short amount of time. Feyre was and is still growing as we continue on in the story but I feel that she matured all she could in the last book and now this novel, we see her embrace that new found maturity and smartness with the decisions she made day to day. Without giving too much away, Feyre felt trapped and ultimately, like she wasn't being used for what she was great in, strategy. She's smart, she always had been and she new survival instincts very well, with what she had to endure as a mortal. She was the one who fended and fed her family daily, then became the lover with a great destiny to a man so powerful it hurt, THEN she managed to not only kill but release the hold of treachery and evilness that came from Amarantha's ruling and STILL managed to die and become immortally powerful. Like damn. Feyre deserves an award for the most endured yet still alive creature on this planet. She really outshone in this novel and I just can't express my love for her in words to you guys. \n \"I was not prey any longer, I decided as I eased up to that door. \n And I was not a mouse. \n I was a wolf.\" \n Rhysand and Tamlin. I have to say, Maas really did a 180 on us with Tamlin. Again, without spoiling anything, lets just say you won't be too impressed with him once you read this book. Rhys was..........almost as amazing as Feyre. Rhys in his own way really grew in the time he spent with Feyre. I mean, Rhys being the most powerful fae in history and ancient, obviously matured a very long time ago but with Feyre he grew into this character that was just astoundingly handsome, strong, caring, loving, emotional and fighting lover. Not getting into too much detail, Rhys really proved himself worthy of not only Feyre, but the whole realm and a possible King for all of the fae, in the future. I have no idea what Maas has in store for Rhys but the way in the end, with his last words in the book, was so amazing that I can't even fathom having to wait a full year before reading those thoughts and words again. But of course, where there is Rhys there is Mor, Cassian, Azrial, and Amren. We get introduced to some of the most amazing companion characters ever in the history of books I've ever read. The clear connection they all have towards and between one another is truly something special. It's so strong and I love when they take in Feyre and they not only show her what it feels like to have people have her back but how willing to lay their lives down in a fight to save one another. The theme, friendship, really shone through this book and I'm so happy Feyre is FINALLY in an environment where she can trust the people indefinitely around her and trust that they'll keep her safe and vice versa. \n \"Hello, Feyre darling,\" he purred.\" \n There are some beautiful and lovely lines in this book and I can't even begin to quote all of them right now. The amount of time I spent just rereading lines and pausing to think about how the hell Maas managed to come up with these words was a lot. LOL a whole months worth of time. \n \"I'm thinking that I was a lonely, hopeless person, and I might have fallen in love with the first thing that showed me a hint of kindness and safety. And I'm thinking maybe he knew that--maybe not actively, but maybe he wanted to be that person for someone. And maybe that worked for who I was before. Maybe it doesn't work for who--what I am now.\" \n I really wish I could go into detail and explain the sheer amount of shock and despair towards the ending I felt but unfortunately for spoiler sake, I cannot :( To say the least, the novel was absolutely amazing and worth every dime and nickel. Again, I can't wait for May 4th, 2017 to read this next book in the series currently named Untitled. Yeah, it's so early that the name hasn't even been released ... Oh God help me. But in the mean time, here are more wonderful quotes from this wonderful novel!!!!! \n \"Did you enjoy the sight of me kneeling before you?\" \n \"He braced a hand on either side of me, gripping the dresser. I refused to shrink away. \"You have one task here, Feyre. One task that no one can know about. So do anything you have to in order to accomplish it. ... And do not get caught.\" I wasn't some simpering fool. I knew the risks. And that tone, that look he always gave me ... \"Anything?\" His brows rose. I breathed, \"If I fucked him for it, what would you do?\" His pupils flared, and his gaze dropped to my mouth. The wood dresser groaned beneath his hands.\" \n \"To the stars who listen--and the dreams that are answered.\" \n \"When you spend so long trapped in darkness, you find that the darkness begins to stare back.\""}

{"text": "As with the first book in this series, I'm rating it three stars because again, despite some major problems, I enjoyed parts of it. \n The positive: \n -The Komizar. What an interesting and compelling character! The scenes between the Komizar and Lia were by far the best parts of this book. I really wish we had gotten more of him. \n -Lia and Rafe. They act like rational human beings in the book! (It's a sad commentary on YA protagonists that this is considered a positive rather than a necessity.) They know how to play the political game and they don't act rashly, emotionally, or have big misunderstandings. Lia, especially in her interactions with the Komizar, shows real cunning and an aptitude for political machinations. \n The negative: \n -The setting. This ENTIRE book takes place in Venda and mostly in the Komizar's main stronghold. That's right! The entire 400 plus page book basically takes place in one castle. After the end of the first book, I thought the world had finally been opened up and would get some epicness! Nope! How dare you want epic fantasy in your epic fantasy. \n -The plot...or lack thereof. Again. *sigh* Remember how nothing really happened in the first two thirds of the previous book? If you enjoyed that, you're in luck, because that's exactly what happens in this one! We only really get those enjoyable interactions with the Komizar and an exciting escape in the last third of the book. For some reason the Komizar leaves in the beginning and all tension is dissipated. No one is going to kill Lia or Rafe while the Komizar is not there, so this entire section is boring and feels like filler. In a perfect world, the last third of this book would the first 100 pages of a super epic sequel. \n -Kaden. Oh delusional, sad Kaden. He kidnaps Lia and delivers her into a possible deadly situation, does nothing to help her escape (and before you jump down my throat he doesn't know she is trying to escape at the end. He jumped in merely to protect her. It isn't clear until later that it's an escape. And then, yes, he goes with her, but he never actively tries to help her escape. ) and actually thinks Lia is developing feelings for him. Even knowing the fact that she chose Rafe over him before he did all those horrible things to her. \n To solidify his terribleness of character, Kaden approves the killing and placing of their heads on pikes of three fourteen year old boys for a minor infraction. Just about the only thing that would have made Kaden redeemable and a much more interesting character would have been if he were secretly working to bring down the Komizar and the current brutal regime. How cool would it have been if Kaden was sabotaging everything, all the while pretending to be a good little soldier."}

There was some fighting and \"battles\" it's more of a fantasy with good and evil. \n One thing I loved about this book is although Gregor is missing his dad. There is a family enviorment. No orphans or whatnot. It was a jump beyond the typical lost boy or girl and finding powers. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that loves fantasy or children's book. \n This book have rats and cockroaches which seems an odd but they turn out to be really good characters. \n Another thing I loved is every character in this book was developed. You get kind of attached to everyone. Not so much the \"bad\" guys but the good guys you do which makes this book even better. \n I could hardly put this book down!"}

I seriously feel like re-reading the Vampire Academy series again...maybe I will around the time the movie comes out. \n It has a cover! At first, I thought it was just so...awkward. It still kind of is but it's grown on me. Sydney looks kind of flushed and disheveled which shows just how much she's grown!"}
{"text": "I listened to this on audiobook, and it was my first completed audiobook as well as my first Neil Gaiman novel. But as such, I'm going to be talking a lot about how this succeeded in the audiobook medium. \n WHAT I LIKED: \n -It was a fairytale for grown ups! It was an original story that had all the fantastical elements of a children's story, while very much being for adults. \n -The narration. Neil Gaiman narrated this story, and the man has a BEAUTIFUL speaking voice. It was so interesting to hear the writer reading his story as it must have sounded in his head. He did all of the voices so wonderfully and really pulled me in to the story. \n -The timeline. The whole story takes place over many years, but we do not see every little event that takes place during that time. We feel the magnitude and scope of the story, without it being drawn out. I really enjoyed that it stuck the the important scenes instead of getting bogged down. \n -How the story interwove. There were so many elements that were mentioned throughout the story that tied up very beautifully in the end to make a complete story. It didn't feel open ended at all. \n WHAT I DISLIKED: \n I honestly cannot think of anything I didn't enjoy. \n Overall, I enjoyed this story very much. I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed it as much if I would have read it myself, but Gaiman's narration was excellent and pulled me in from the beginning. Fans of fairy tales and fantasy alike will enjoy this."}
{"text": "Oh this book though. It's got a Alice in Wonderland vibe that I love and makes anything possible in this book. This book literally made me nervous because you feel as though you don't know which character to trust anymore or who to believe or what. And once you got to the point where you get what's going to happen then it just messes with you. I just really overall enjoy how the author includes the reader in this adventure and mystery. The main character, Scarlet, was not a character that I loved but she grew on me a bit towards the end. I love the whole idea that the author has built but I do feel like the writing needs some more something to it and I'm not quite sure what but I just felt that way throughout the book. I love the fact that this book sort of has closure but doesn't. There are some unanswered details/questions in book one that I hope are answered in book two. I would totally recommend this book to anyone! 5 stars!!"}

Finding out they're brother and sister has set a very weird vibe between the two. I can't really blame them, seeing how they had to jump from a romantic relationship to a sibling relationship so suddenly. I really hope we find out that they're really not siblings, I feel like the book is hinting that way or maybe I'm just hoping! \n The ending leaves you with wanting to know more, I can't wait to get to the next book!"}
{"text": "Beth W says: \n Really it's a pretty amazing book. A pharmacist and his comatose son move to a new town with a supposedly top notch facility for coma patients. The town is more than a bit peculiar and unwelcoming. The pharmacist takes a job at the clinic where his son resides to keep a close careful watch over him, and always reads to him his favorite comic book, LIMBO. LIMBO is based on a rejected \"family\" of circus freaks, who are on the run and looking for a new home that will accept them. LIMBO stories show up between every couple of chapters. What is most difficult to explain is that the \"real world\" and \"limbo\" start to overlap in bizarre ways and the result is both touching and pretty eerie. \n This was a entertaining read. And I think it gave me some pretty strange dreams. It's all about family, freaks, forgiveness, and hope. I liked it!"}

{"text": "Crosspost: TheReadingBelle.com \n Harry Potter And The Cursed Child takes places nineteen years after Deathly Hallows, and the main character is Albus Severus Potter. Going into this book, I knew that the book was not going to focus on some my beloved characters such as Neville Longbottom, Luna Lovegood, nor the Weasley clan. I wanted at least some cameos like Teddy Lupin or Hagrid, but that's not the case with this book. Keep in mind that this book is written in a play format, and it only focuses on Albus and Harry Potter. \n This book is somewhat controversial, some fans accept Harry Potter and The Cursed Child as canon while others do not. I won't reveal the reason why it's controversial because it will literally spoil the book. The book is a lot of fun, don't get me wrong, but it did not satisfy my Harry Potter needs. This book felt like fan fiction even though J.K. Rowling collaborated on this. \n What I didn't love about the book was the characterizations of some of the characters. Harry Potter felt like a completely different person. He was a terrible father in this book, but only to one of his children. Some of his actions were very, very questionable. I would have loved the book if Harry had more interactions with James and Lily. This book mainly focuses on Harry and Albus' deteriorating relationship, and there is a lot of miscommunication between the two. I loved Ron and Hermione in this book. I was so happy that they had several scenes together. Anyways, the plot wasn't original as I had hoped it would be, but it was still fun and a bit ridiculous at the same time.When it came to the villain, I immediately knew who it was. It was obvious!!!!! \n My favorite character had to be Scorpius Malfoy. He was absolutely precious in every way. He stole my heart. Scorpius was more of a follower than a leader, he was a bookworm, and one of the kindest characters from the new generation. Draco is very protective when it comes to Scorpius. Scorpius deals with a lot of prejudice against him. I felt his storyline was amazing! It was very saddening knowing what the rumors against him were. \n As for his relationship with Albus, it had so much buildup. They are best friends, and they would do anything for each other. I would have preferred if Albus and Scorpius were a couple. Some of the scenes they had together made it seem that they had romantic feelings for each other. Would have loved if this book was LGBT. As for Rose Granger-Weasley, she was the best of both worlds. She was athletic, and studious. A perfect balance of Ron and Hermione. Sadly, she has only a couple scenes in the book. \n As for Albus, he was very angsty towards his father. He is a Slytherin, and feels he is cursed because Harry Potter is his father. He feels that he can't be his own person because he is Harry Potter's son. He is not talented in magic, not athletic. He is the black sheep of his family. The outcast. His other siblings are both in Gryffindor. I didn't like how he isolated himself from everyone else. I like how much he grows throughout his journey. \n Do I find this book canon? It was a lot a fun, and though some of what I read contradicted the Harry Potter books, I don't find this to be canon. It is what it is, a play that was cowritten with J.K. Rowling and others. \n Final Rating: [?][?][?] (3.5)"}
{"text": "This series has me hooked but frustrated at the same time. Jace and Claire have ANOTHER obstacle to overcome to be together, which is getting really annoying. I just want them to be together for more than 5 minutes without having some crazy demon, shadowhunter, or vampire after them. I hate that this book had me disliking Jace, even though the way he is is not his fault. I really read this one pretty fast, because I just wanted to see what will happen, a lot of action and fighting with leaving us at the end of the story still wondering about Sebastion. \n I have to say that Simon has grown into a likable character throughout this series, at first I was not a big fan. I also just LOVE Luke, I think he is just the sweetest guy and glad that Luke and Jocelyn are together, kind of figured that out a while ago. Maia and Jordan are just adorable and glad they could forget the past and move forward together. I'm looking forward to reading the next book and hoping that Jace and Claire can be happy together for more than 5 minutes without being ripped apart."}
{"text": "I received a RC from Harper Voyager publishing. \n A great modern-fantastical twist on a classic that keeps readers guessing and intrigued! With a slight feminist twist and delightful characters, Ms. Eliza Jekyll and Miss Lizzie Hyde keep their respective parts of a steampunky London in check with their conflicting methods of detective work. Twists and turns abound, leaving the identity of The Chopper a muddled mysterious secret until the very end. Eliza and Lizzie battle it out, together, and otherwise, to unravel secrets of a murderer on the loose and their own selves. A wonderful read and a refreshing take on an old classic for contemporary readers. Chick-litty enough for the feminine persuasion, but still gritty, gory, and dark enough to be an entertaining thrill ride of a mystery for anyone looking for their next favorite bookish crime drama. Definitely a great read. Cannot wait for The Devious Dr. Jekyll!! <3"}

{"text": "This book picks up from BITE MARK. This review contains some spoilers. \n 4.5 stars for a sexy, paranormal adventure. \n Beatrice is a London butcher with a rare Bombay blood type. Her blood is such a delicacy and so rare that the two vampires who discovered her, Ryle and Aimery, married her immediately to place her under their protection before she was bled dry. Beatrice is ecstatic to be shared by her loving husbands--they are kind and compassionate, and skilled. They always ensure her health by fortifying her with herbal teas which boost her strength and replenish her blood supply. Still, Elfrida, a member of the High Council, wishes to have Bea's blood--and she has followed our merry trio to their Caribbean retreat in the hopes of isolating Bea for draining. \n Aimery and Ryle plan an elaborate escape to the Canadian Rockies, knowing the presence of a large werewolf clan will mask Bea's scent--and hoping the werewolf threat will keep Elfrida from following. \n No Dice. A train wreck separates the lovers, and Bea believes she's the only survivor--mostly because Elfrida snatched her from the wreckage. On the cusp of death, two wolves startle Elfrida mid-bite and save Bea. \n Over the course of a few months, Bea mourns her lost lovers, while languishing in the homey cabin of Isaac and Caleb--a gay pair. What Bea doesn't understand is how these two men thrive in isolation--especially with all this wolves around! \n Okay, she does catch on to Caleb and Isaac's secret life as wolves eventually--but goes with it as they are keeping Elfrida well away. We get some serious gay voyeurism, and a bit of menage, not to mention straight lovin'. And, when the climax hits (the book's climax, people!) Bea finds she has the strength to save her own self--and the lives of men who love her. \n This is a super steamy read with a bit of smexytimes for all comers---M/F, M/M, F/M/M, M/F/M. The paranormal elements are fun and consistent. I adored Caleb as much as Bea did, he was so kind and sweet--not to mention fearless. The book ends with a solid resolution, but I could see the series continuing with new plot lines."}

When I read No Regrets however, I was immediately hooked, and had to eat a small serving of crow. Damn that woman can write- and Burning Alive, her first paranormal romance is no exception.

{"text": "Wow. When I started reading this book, I was very underwhelmed. Red Queen has a lot of hype and I felt like the writing in the beginning was very basic and the characters and the story line were kind of flat and boring. THAT BEING SAID, this book gets exponentially better as it progresses--writing, character and plot wise. If you aren't completely loving the book during the first 100 pages, KEEP READING. A lot of what I thought was \"bad writing\" ended up being the foundation for plot twists that I mistook for plot holes at the time. I trusted characters that I knew I shouldn't have trusted, and when their betrayal came, it still broke my heart. For the last 100 pages of this book, I was completely immersed and could not put the book down. Mare Barrow is a complete badass and I love her for it. I think this book had to set up a lot, and that now the next books will continue to get better and better!"}
{"text": "The best-seller and awarded the GOODREADS CHOICE 2014 WINNER and which is said to have done well at the box office since October 02, 2015 is indeed WORTH READING. I repeat it is WORTH READING. \n If you have not read it yet and have been curious about why it is such a big talk in the Goodreads universe, I would like you to bear in mind first some reminders before you prep it- but not necessarily that you take them; I know you would still give it a try at any cost out of idle curiosity. \n You should be ready that reading it requires a paucity of MATH and other branches of science such as CHEMISTRY, ASTRONOMY, ENGINEERING, PHYSICS , BOTANY, to name a few unless you majored in one of them. Otherwise, you might end up in a moment of epistaxis and cerebral hemorrhage. In other words, the novel is strewn with technical words. Therefore, make sure that you have internet connection at your disposal to Google some words beyond your imagination. In doing so can help you understand the story more clearly. \n The concept of the story is very new to me, for it may be my second Sci-Fi. The last one was the CONTACT by Carl Sagan. I had enjoyed it at first since I was not completely familiar with all stuff in the universe. However, I lost my interest in its book cover edition; I was very choosy then. (Uh-oh! Beggars cannot be choosers.) Then, I could no longer get around to it. \n An astronaut is stranded on Mars when it just happens that he is not able to leave it with his other crews in the midst of the sandstorm. In order to survive the red planet, he will use his vast knowledge of Botany and Engineering as well as his wide training and experience in Astronomy. Each day is perilous for Mark as if he walks with a tight rope. \n Admittedly, I was close to demoting it to 3 stars ( Not that bad. I still liked it ) for the three reasons: \n (1.) I did not like the writing style, let alone its prose. It is brusque in context despite the fact that it is pregnant with jargon. ( But I know there is nothing wrong with brusque language ; it could still be an art. Probably, it is not my cup of tea. I am more used to classic writings just the like of award-winning writers'. You know what I meant to say. ^^) Nevertheless, in the end, I realized that Andy Weir's intention is to voice what a devastating life of an astronaut stuck on such barren and dreary planet is like . ( If I am not mistaken!) \n (2. ) Although I enjoyed the parts in the beginning, of how Mark Wanty sorts his dilemma out, the longer he describes his some problems , the more I find them a pain in the ass. In short, they were taxing me too. \n (3.) The plot of the story is banal and typical of other there-should-be-on-the-rescue-scenes science fictions. \n On the other hand, I can't forbear from lavishing praise on it: \n (1.) Indeed, it is spell-binding. Every page is so enthralling that I could no longer recognize the people around me, that I was not aware of them, of my environment at all. (laughs) \n (2.) I liked its ending. It does not need to show that Mark Wanty will have a tear-jerking hero's welcome as soon as he is back on Earth. The last breath-taking scene of how he gets aboard and his final journal are enough to bring a thousand words. Weir might have been aware that readers are already familiar with that schematic denouement. \n (3.) I learned a whole lot about science. In fact, I feel like studying Astronomy. (blushing) I am now very interested in studying the heavenly bodies. All the things about Cosmo, NASA, space exploration, thingamabob. Wow! What an interesting field! \n (4.) The theme is very purely scientific. It focuses just on Mars probe. As far as we know, Mars has been the favorite hobbyhorse among scientists in the hypothesis that whether there is a high chance to live on this planet or not. \n (5.) It is very scientifically detailed. Obviously, Andy Weir researched about Mars and NASA thoroughly, especially the problems on Mars Mark Wanty has to sort out such as on how to produce water and oxygen , plant , repair the machines , blah blah blah . Wow, I was impressed. Kudos to him! ^_^ \n (6.) Despite its typically there-should-be-on-the-rescue-scenes story, the epistolary writing riddled with technical words did the justice. So, I can't say that there is nothing new to it. Rather, I highly recommend it to everyone, notably to students who have been taught the Creationism. \n Upon reading it, I would like to conclude that: \n (a.) The book AWKWARDLY suggests that China has a hidden ambition to compete with the USA in the field of space exploration. The good thing is that China has not given Andy Weir a brunt of criticism nor even declared him persona non grata yet. Perhaps Weir also suggests that China has the capacity to keep up with the modern technology despite the world's stereotype about made-in-China products. \n (b.) The book suggests the perpetual debate among theists and atheists whether God exists or not. \n (c.) The book suggests that sometimes NASA or science itself has limitations; scientific analyses could be invalid, but nothing is impossible. \n (d.) The book suggests that we, the world, at any cost, is raring to spend billions of dollars on space exploration. (Paradoxically, there is a widespread famine in some parts of the world.) \n (e.) The book suggests that we could be optimistic in a dire situation. ( I doubt it. ) Probably yes, since we have the survival instinct. But gee, if I were Mark Watney, probably no! since I am not that as genius as he is.( laughs) \n (f.) The book suggests that we should use our \"common sense\" as well as need to be knowledgeable about science at all times if the need rises. \n (g.) The book suggests that a human being has a basic instinct to help one another out as what Mark Watney exemplifies at the end of the book : \n \"If a hiker gets lost in the mountains, people will coordinate a search. If a train crashes, people will line up to give blood. If an earthquake levels a city, people all over the world will send emergency supplies. This is so fundamentally human that it's found in every culture without exception. Yes, there are assholes who just don't care, but they're ,massively outnumbered by the people who do. And because of that, I had billions of people on my side.\" \n Well, no doubt it has received positive feedback, so the British magazine site ,The Guardian , should put it on the new pedestal of 1001 Best Novels of All Time. \n Since I am done with it, I am all systems go for its movie adaptation, especially the actor who leads the role of Mark Watney is one of my favorite Hollywood actors, Matt Damon. 13 13 13 ^_"}
{"text": "Whenever I think about this book, all I can think about is what happened to the family dog. I won't say, but you can probably guess that it isn't good. \n As for the rest of the book, it has an interesting concept and the suspense builds throughout the story. The main character has to defeat larger and larger foes (guess how many times) until the climax at the end. It kind of reminds me of a video game where you have to defeat a boss at the end of each level and the big boss at the end. \n The author was able to create characters that you really felt something for and was able to add supernatural elements into the life of a character who had never been exposed to anything supernatural. This increased his struggle as how do you explain that cat(s) are trying to kill you? I wouldn't have believed him. This allowed me to really feel the protagonists pain as he fights these crazy felines alone while trying to keep his family safe and act normal so he doesn't get committed. \n Overall, it was a good story but stars were lost as I am more of a dog person."}

{"text": "The first book written by Bob Ong that led me to the portal of his idiosyncrasies is Bakit Baliktad Magbasa Ng Libro Ang Mga Pilipino?I was impressed by his ways of writing out his ideas or opinions in a conversational way. Reading it was like an editorial article full of facts but funny, intended not only for young but also old adults . Besides, I sensed his hidden blaze of nationalism. Amused, I borrowed Macarthur from my cousin who happened to be his avid reader. After that, I was magnetized again because the theme is not that as deeply and humorously academic and journalistic as the former one but, instead, it is a simple story that young readers may never forget because it reflects the social problem with illegal drug. The story is so worth remembering. No wonder when you ask a young avid fan about which Bob Ong books his/ her favorite is. I bet my boots that it is one of them. And please, count me in. THE VERY THOUGHT OF THE SACHET OF CRYSTAL METH FLOATING IN THE POOPED BOWL REPULSES ME. \n I was in university when I got the opportunity to read another Bob Ong book. Another Bob Ong fan lent me some of his other works. I got the good chance of reading Stainless Longganisa . But I admit that I found it pretty boring. It is just a story of how a writer struggles with completing his book or having it published. If it is so, why did Bob Ong make it more complicated with his satirical dramas? He could have just written it in the other way around. But who am I to cast aspersion on his writing style? WALANG BASAGAN NG TRIP.This is his trademark. \n I was disappointed more after reading his other books such as Ang Paboritong Libro ni Hudas and Kapitan Sino . They almost have the same pattern. The situation was like all Bob Ong had to do was to strike up a witty conversation with me ,with his satirical sentiments and dramas. Thereafter, I got sick and tired of Bob Ong. NAKAKASAWA NA. I promised myself then that I would not read another Bob Ong books. \n I tried to read another Bob Ong when friends of mine gave me an intriguing idea of Ang mga Kaibigan ni Mama Susan. My friends said that it is a scary one. Hmmm...Another friend tampered with my febrile imagination claiming that she could not sleep it off. After burying myself in it for the whole night, yes! My friends did not prove me wrong. I was horrified. Somehow, it scared me so witless that I would it put down when I did not want to read what would happen next. I did not want to picture how the scenes look like. Then, my hair stood on end when I patched all the puzzling parts together. GEE, THAT'S WHY? A typical reaction when you have come to understand everything. Who won't forget the scene when the grandma who is supposed to be dead gets up from its bed to approach Galo, the protagonist? Who regretted reading the Latin phrases at the end of his each diary? How about the secret room in where the human -sized saints are kept ? \n The story is clearly manipulating because Bob Ong intended to play our imagination. All the settings are mixed. He intended to lead us in some parts which turn out to be the linchpin of the horror. For instance, Galo also makes us read the Latin phrases he reads out of curiosity . Even though I didn't understand the words, I still kept on reading them. But , in the end, I deeply regretted doing so. YOU SHOULD NOT READ THEM IF I WERE YOU. It is a warning. Plus, the twins, Jezel and Niko .Potek,I thought they were just 'saling pusa'. \n I was first confused with some information with which Bob Ong padded in the story. For instance, the date of the setting is in 1998. But MTB, a famous noon-time show ,was not aired in that year yet. Another thing is a high-tech computer. As far as I know, high-tech computers were unveiled in the 2000's. There are some more happened in the 2000's Bob Ong played back in the 1990's. Thus, I inferred that Bob Ong loves to scrabble all the things that happened from different generations. \n My friend speculates that Bob Ong may have written it off the cuff. He may have dabbled in writing it in a corner without any specific theme on his mind. So, his publisher may have ignored it and still seen its potential to give his readers the creeps knowing that he has established a name in the market. Or she may have meant to say that the story begins with Galo's \"nega moments\"; then, all of a sudden, it segues into a horror part. Thus, the book appears to be inscrutable because she is not sure what Bob Ong may want to imply in this book since all his books appear to have satirical meanings. But apparently, one of the insinuations could be that anyone can have a Cinderella life. OF COURSE NOT! GALO DOES NOT HAVE A PRINCess CHARMING.( laughs) \n Somehow, there are good points in the story that caught my interest aside from the \"katatakutan\" moment. I liked the philosophical conversations between Mama Susan and Galo although I find them obscure and irrelevant to whatever Bob Ong wants to preach to us. Besides, if it were not Mama Susan's revelation about Galo's past , I would really have demoted Bob Ong to all wannabe writers (like me) by giving it one out of 5 stars on Goodreads. Fiddlesticks! I wish I read books literally. \n As a matter of fact, after reading it, I don't want to give it a try again nor flip through its pages given that I found it not that really scary .

{"text": "Is it a sin to fall in love with a character in a book? I certainly hope not, because I absolutely fell in love with Seth, the human love interest in this story. And he's a kid who has bars in his eyebrows and a piercing in his lip, so no, someone like Seth wouldn't typically be my type. But he's so loving, gentle, non-judgmental, and supportive . . . too good to be true, really, which is why I fell in love with him. Fictional boys can be so much more dreamy than real boys. Anyway, I digress. The relationship between Aislinn and Seth in this book is so beautiful and soft that it makes it downright impossible not to love this book. At least, for me, it was downright impossible. Plus, the pacing was absolutely perfect, the plot was well thought out, and the read was engaging. I loved this book!"}

Purtroppo pero, credo sia troppo infantile per chi, come me, ha ormai varcato la soglia dell'eta adulta. \n La trama e scontata, carino il condimento (i nomi, le ambientazioni...) ma tutto il resto e e resta banale a mio parere. Non l'ho letto con piacere, sono sincera. Almeno in questo primo volume, non ci ritrovo il capolavoro acclamato da molti, non lo trovo originale, ne tantomeno profondo. Si dice che i libri per bambini non siano veramente belli se non trasmettono qualcosa anche agli adulti, se non sono godibili anche per loro e se non toccano il loro cuore. Ebbene, il primo libro di questa trilogia non mi ha emozionata, mi ha lasciata indifferente, come se mi fosse scivolato sulla pelle. Ho letto libri per bambini di gran lunga piu meritevoli di questo... Per ora gli assegno un voto intermedio, aspetto di leggere i seguiti per decidere se bocciare definitivamente la serie o se ricredermi e tornare sui miei passi."}
{"text": "I was thoroughly entertained during this book. Actually, I've felt that way during the two first books of this series. I can't wait to read the next one! If I can ever get through my reading list. \n Very first thing I did after finishing this book? Look to see if there was a movie in the making. To my amazing and wonderful surprise, there is. ECSTATIC! \n This book continues the story of Zoey Redbird as she tries to fit into her life at the House of Night. Except, she's growing and with that comes responsibilities. and hormones She now has to deal with not only being the most powerful fledging her age but with her thoughts and developing powers. \n The events of the book were shocking in that the author manages to keep you engaged during the whole story with things that, in my opinion, are not so relevant and then BAM! throws in something that no one saw coming. Actually, and I won't spoil, I was beyond surprised at the turn of events in this book. To the point where I debated continuing the series or quitting on it. I'm continuing. \n I don't think the writing is splendid but it's a good past time. \n TEAM LOREN! TEAM ERIK! team foursome?"}

{"text": "When I signed on to read this book I didn't know it was NINTH in a series. I must say that this book is best enjoyed when read in order. For those who are new to it, it's still a fast-paced adventure, but the myriad characters, of good, evil, and undecided factions, are a lot to absorb. \n The heart of this book is the love story that develops when Ryder, one of the Dragon Kings who inhabit Dreagan mountain (and whisky distillery) reunites with his lost love, an accomplished hacker named Kinsey. Ryder and Kinsey met four years prior and shared a deep love for a year. Then, Ryder disappeared without a trace. And brokenhearted Kinsey searched high and low for him. \n In the three years since she's had only one contact with Ryder, seeing him descend out of a flying dive as a dragon, who morphed into his human form to save her from death at the hands of a Dark Fae. Kinsey was rattled to say the very least. Sent by her company, Kyvor, to Dreagan's offices, she's stunned to meet Ryder face-to-face. No one can explain why she's on the property, and a bogus work order only sends Kinsey and Ryder deep into the inner communications of Kyvor's elite agents. As the time passes, Kinsey's struck by her attraction to Ryder, and Ryder's eager to spend any time he can with Kinsey-even if it means snuggling in beside her as she sleeps, because she ain't leaving now that she's breached their inner web of security. \n Alongside of this are the continuing plot threads of the series-the looming war with Ulrik, a deposed Dragon King, battles with the Dark Fae, and that pesky Human problem. Just when it seemed as if all would work out, we had another curve ball hefted right at our reconnected lovebirds. This one was nearly fatal, but crisis-averted due to cooler heads at work. Thank goodness, because Ryder would have been devastated to have harmed Kinsey and later determined she was an innocent. There's a little bit of lovin' going on, but not much considering the length of the book. \n Also, this book is being released in four parts. It's probably intriguing for fans of the series, but fresh readers are going to want the full-book upfront as the early parts have too many people and too little substance tying them together to keep the narrative compelling. I found that I really didn't get engaged until the end of the second part, nearly halfway through the book. That's my own fault for not having read the previous eight books, so I stuck with it to the end and really liked it. \n I received a review copy of this book via NetGalley."}
{"text": "There are books out there that I immediately know I'm not going to love, but something about the novel makes me want to read. Think of it like those people who pass car accidents and rubber neck - they want to look away but can't. That is me with some books and Cruel Beauty was one of those. \n I would like to note that this is a Beauty and the Beast retelling with a side of 'guess my name' thrown in. It is like a hodgepodge of fairy tales thrown in with some mythology to create a very confusing book. \n The minute our main character, Nyx, is saying and performing wedding vows to a statue, I knew I was in for treat. I'll just kind of give a rundown on my favorite parts of this novel - \n The wedding ceremony between Nyx and the statue - the ceremony wasn't bad and really it wasn't until halfway through the book that I had an issue with it. My issue was Nyx and everyone else took it so seriously. Every time she'd mention she was married (and seriously thought she was), I wanted to scream BUT YOU MARRIED A STATUE. \n The plot - This story can ultimately be summary that looks like this. \n Nyx marries statue. Nyx taken to Gentle Lord's castle. Nothing happens. Nyx is mean. Nyx wanders around castle. Nyx falls in love with shadow. Nyx wanders around castle. Nyx falls into love with Lord. Nyx wanders around the castle. Nyx falls out of love. Nyx wanders around the castle. \n There is so much wandering around the castle with so little plot progression. Combine that with the wish-washy nature of Nyx and the book just seemed so overfilled with unnecessary stuff. \n The mythology - Lots and lots of mythology information dumping. Some of it was needed to understand the story, some of it wasn't. It felt like the mythology was being thrown in to make things complicated and confusing. \n Characters - Nyx was extremely frustrating. Her moods changed to fit the plot and she was a mean, selfish witch the entire book. Not to mention she couldn't make a decision to save her life. Her sister and her family was just as bad. \n The predictable nature of the book - I predicted what would happen. There was a slight twist but 90% of the book I saw coming within the first 40 pages or so. \n I will say the writing was smooth, it was the plot that was confusing. The author is clearly talented, but this was an example of a good idea gone bad."}

{"text": "I have a confession to make - I'm not the biggest fan of Tom Lloyd's books. It isn't the mythos, or the violence, or even the characters. There is something in the way that Lloyd constructs sentences that hurts my brain. \n I realize that sounds petty and weak, and it is, but it makes reading a full length novel of his difficult. I'm sure listening to a narrated version would be fine - I've learned that lesson with a few other authors lately - but something in the word to brain translation breaks down and I begin to develop a book induced migraine. My internal critic screams at what seem like run-on sentences devoid of punctuation. \n Which is why I'm as surprised as you now are to know I'm going to recommend the God Tattoo so highly. This collection of \"Untold Tales from the Twilight Reign\" follows the same universe as his other Twilight Reign novels, replete with White Eyes and magics and forces both terrible and dark. But somehow, distilled into these short vignettes, each chapter a story in itself, it was actually a really fun and entertaining read. \n Of course, like any story collection, not all stories are created equal, and some are better than others. Fans of Lloyd's will enjoy the collection, and fantasy readers interested in a collection of fun fantasy adventures will find something entertaining here as well. This companion book contains a well rounded collection of mysteries, gothic fairytales, and classic adventure stories - set in the world of the Seven Tribes. \n Enjoy!"}

I hadn't heard the best things about Caraval from my fellow Goodreads friends. As my friend Tanya said in her review 'It's not even a book but a bad fanfiction that got published.' I think that was enough for me to do a serious hard pass. But a few months ago as I was searching the YA book tag on Pinterest and this book kept popping up and I took a closer look at it. From the summary it reminded me of The Night Circus and even though it has been a few years since I've read that book, I still liked it. So I decided to give Caraval a try. \n And while yes, I do agree that Scarlett is whiny - jeez we get it, you're trying to save your sister, you do not need to keep saying it every freaking page - there's actually something quite odd about her.

{"text": "I feel kind of bad I didn't like this because I really wanted to. The story was good in that the plot kept moving and there was plenty of action all around, but I found I just didn't care. I know that sounds awful, but for a lot of the book it seemed like I was watching the action on a movie screen rather than living vicariously through the characters. I didn't really connect with any of the characters or care about them enough to make reading this enjoyable. Aside from her love of movies, I didn't feel like I knew the protagonist very well, not even at the end of the book. \n Her love interest, Simon, was woefully underdeveloped, and as a result I didn't care one way or the other whether the protagonist ended up with him. The strongest character was Derek, who I found myself liking more than Simon. There were a ton of plot twists, but not a lot of foreshadowing, which made me want to throw up my hands and say, \"And where did that come from?\" \n The funny thing about that is that I can usually predict twists before they happen. Most authors have the opposite problem where they foreshadow too much until the mystery is gone and there's no surprise. But Kelley Armstrong keeps the reader so much in the dark that by the time the twist has happened, you're grabbing your head and saying. \"Where on earth did that come from?\" And I'm not talking about the Werewolf business, that was done well. But the part at the end where Aunt Lauren turns out to be working against her neice . . . that really irritated me because there wasn't anything clearly leading up to it. \n By the time I reached the end of the novel, I wanted to throw it across the room. Why? Because I realized I knew absolutely nothing about Lyle House! And wasn't that the mystery the story was supposed to solve? \n Note to authors: if you are writing a series. Please tie up most of your loose ends at the end of the first book. Granted, I know it's a series, so you can't wrap up all of them. But consider leaving one open, maybe two if you're really daring--but please, oh, please--I beg you not to wrap up one and leave five more dangling open like in this book. It made me feel like all that reading was a waste of my time and I assure you, I won't be picking up the sequel."}
{"text": "After reading the synopsis, I have to say I was very intrigued. I loved the plot and the whole concept of the book I just think it needs a little work. \n I was a little disappointed at some of the errors, eg repetitions throughout the story, where Damian lived, was a little confusing and just in general the characters which I have to say I didn't connect to any of them. \n Damian he was all over the place really nice guy one minute then totally weird psycho type the next. Raven hmm, didn't really get her, she was ok one minute and strange the next especially towards her mother, their relationship was strange also it seemed like they had a really good relationship at first then that went out the window and they were basically shouting at each other all the time. \n Overall I think it was a good book, it could be a great book I with a few changes I will definitely read the next one as I am intrigued to find out where the story goes. \n Thanks to the author and (LOP) for this one in return for an honest review."}

He didn't love her, she didn't love him, they barely knew each other, but who are they to fight fate/science, so oh well. Sands always redeems herself by the end, but still...

So in the last book, Vlad got married to Leila after realizing that he couldn't live without her. Maximus became an asshat. Marty keeps on being undead despite all the attempts on his life. And Leila and Vlad found out that their worst enemy - whose name I still can't spell to save my life and who will be known in this review as Big Bad - is still alive. Now, they're on the move to take him out before he can take them out. \n Vlad is still being his archaic self, and is over protecting Leila to the point where she's about to lose her shit. They've discovered that if he coats her in his aura, she can't use her electric or telekinetic linking abilities. This doesn't go over well when Leila realizes that he's doing this on purpose. It doesn't help either that he keeps going off on his own, leaving her at the mansion armed with a lot of guards. However, that plan doesn't seem to work when Big Bad attacks the mansion, causing it to explode and attacks the survivors with flame. He was hoping to kill Leila, but instead - at Maximus's insistence - takes her prisoner... \n At this point in Frost's Night Prince/Huntress world, I think I've seen it all, because I was kind of numb to a lot of what happened in this book."}

{"text": "It's somewhat embarrassing to admit that I had ample opportunities to read this book when it was in two parts, independently published - and failed to do so until it was bought up by Orbit and reprinted. \n That was a mistake. \n Originally published separately, readers can see the divide between the events and repercussions of the first book (Crown Conspiracy) that lead into the second book (Avempartha), and how together they form the chapters of a much larger tapestry. Sullivan sites the story arcs of Babylon 5 as one of his inspirations, and in reading the novel you can see that play out as he gives the reader a simple, straightforward collection of fantasy tropes building up our expectations that this story is going in one direction, only to flip it at the climax and offer a resolution that both fits the story so far, and yet defies what we anticipated. \n The curious thing about Sullivan's book is that he uses light strokes to paint a picture. He doesn't labor over info dumping, choosing instead to give us a who's who and a what's what at the start of the book, and a few short dumps initially to fill in the gaps. Nor does he rely on the shock that grittier fantasy authors have brought us lately; this book is very much a homage o the simple, well written adventure story. While its most basic elements are a variation of the quest and heist motifs, there are deeper motivations at play than just greed. The real strength in Sullivan's writing, though, is in his dialog, the repertoire and voice of his characters making them distinct enough to stand out from the backdrop. No, not all of the characters are well rounded personas with depth, but the characters with whom the story revolves live and breathe in the mind's eye even after you set the book down. \n Theft of Swords is not high literature, with flowing, flowery passages evoking a deep sense of wonder. What it is is wonderfully entertaining. Case in point, I sat down and read the last 40% of the book in one day because I just couldn't put it down. Highly recommended to fans of epic fantasy, especially if you enjoy the \"lighter\" side such as a Brandon Sanderson or Daniel Abraham novel, you will enjoy this."}

The whole Universe of the story is very complex and multi-layered that I feel the story could have been much longer to fully explain everything. Griffen is a very straight-forward character with little surprise. The story moves very fast without much explanation or details specifically with regard to Griffen's training (advances from a newborn to a skilled vardger in several pages) and her relationships (gets attached to two characters from first sight). \n Overall, it was very enjoyable and I would be interested to read more in the Universe of Mirror Souls. \n ARC provided by the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."}

{"text": "I read this book quickly because I hated reading it and just wanted it to be over. To be honest, I was also skimming in parts despite my attempts to pay attention because the book was so eye glazingly dull and impenetrably written. The Goblin Emperor has been on my radar since it came out two years ago. I love reading about court intrigue and I was thrilled at the thought of a fantasy novel rooted in the details of governance. I have no problem putting on my political science hat when reading fiction. The plot synopsis sounded awesome to me. \n I thought the premise of this book had such potential, which is why I never totally abandoned it despite the fact that I never enjoyed it and it never held my attention for more than a few pages at a time. Sadly, reading this is such a chore. There are a million characters with super complex, ridiculous \"fantasy\" names and the language is ridiculously stuffy and formal and flowery. Since Maia is such a naif you have no idea what's going on just like him. Good luck keeping track of who is who and what is what. The enclosed glossary at the back isn't any help. I understand why Addison made these linguistic choices, but they didn't work for me at all as a reader and made this pretty much unbearable. I could never get into the rhythm of this book, and I was always bored and/or frustrated while reading it. \n This is just such a tedious slog. Had the cast been cut in half and if they had names a reader could actually remember and personalities maybe I would have cared about some of these people. Had the pacing not been so terrible maybe I would have cared about what plot there is. The world building is overly focused on language and clothing to the detriment of anything resembling a real book. Maia's an improbably kindly protagonist but that's not enough to make such an obnoxiously written book enjoyable."}
{"text": "Crosspost: TheReadingBelle.com \n The Rose & The Dagger has been very hyped up since last year, and I was one of the fans that was highly anticipating the conclusion to The Wrath & The Dawn. The hype did not kill my reading experience at all, in fact I was really excited when I was reading it. The Wrath & The Dawn duology is absolutely perfect. There were hardly any flaws in both books, and I am so glad that it was just two books. \n I've noticed that most readers complained that the beginning of the story started off slowly, but that was not the case for me. The story was good from beginning to end. This book had several things going for it. The curse, and the upcoming war played a huge part in this book. I was stressed when I was reading the book. More than usual. And the stress wasn't unnecessarily bad, it just made the reading experience much more fun. I was emotionally invested, and I love being transported into the world. \n Now, moving on to the characters. I love Shahrzad, she is terrific and just as feisty in this book. Her character was consistent throughout the book, and she did get some character development. Shahrzad may not be physically strong, but when you mess with her, she fights like a lioness. I found her interactions with Khalid to be hilarious, especially concerning her temper. As for Khalid, he was wonderful. I really can't imagine anyone else for Shahrzad, besides him. Also, how can you not like him? \n \"Two stubborn lovers, protecting each other from the very same threat.\" \n As for the supporting characters, I grew to love Irsa (Shahrzad's younger sister). I loved the sister dynamic. Shahrzad is fighter and loud, while Irsa is docile and meek. I love the way how Irsa would compare herself as a meek mouse. I can completely relate with Irsa. I was glad that she got a lot of screen time in the book, and I especially love the growth she goes through. She even stands up to Khalid, even though she is completely terrified of talking back to royalty. Irsa's story had me in tears. (That was probably the only time that I cried during reading TRATD) \n I was a bit disappointed that Despina and Jalal were not as involved with the story. I really wanted more moments between Despina and Jalal. I have to say that Despina's family history is revealed, and I was not expecting it, and what a twist. That's one of my minor complaints from the book since I loved them in the first book. Lastly, I loved how much girl power this book had. I don't really want to spoil this book, because it is one of my top books for this year. \n Renee Ahdieh has a beautiful writing style, and she's been one of my favorite authors since last year. If you find yourself having a reading slump, then I would highly suggest reading this series. Honestly, the first book was the one to save me from my reading slump and it has a special place in my heart. \n Quotes: \n \"It was because they were two parts of a whole. He did not belong to her. And she did not belong to him. It was never about belonging to someone. It was about belonging together.\" \n \"I've missed the silence of you listening to me.\" Shahrzad attempted a weak smile. \"No one listens to me as you do.\" His expression turned quizzical. \"You don't wait to speak,\" she clarified. \"You truly listen.\" \"Only to you,\" Khalid replied gently.\" \n \"For nothing, not the sun, not the rain, not even the brightest star in the darkest sky, could begin to compare to the wonder of you.

There's still stuff that bothers me about her behavior (such as her desire to \"hear\" him through stupid, irrational, irresponsible behavior) but this book has shifted for me into my \"favorite\" of the Twilight series, in part because... well, there's not much Edward in it, so he can't be too controlling and obnoxious. \n Here again, Meyer drops little hints about other characters in the book that made me screech, \"That's brilliant! Why don't you write about that?!\" (like the Father Marcus who chased all the vampires out of Italy was actually Marcus from the Volturi... ahaha, that's awesome!) \n The problem is that for two-thirds of the novel, she builds Jacob into such a great guy that it's hard to understand why Bella can't just pick him. Jacob makes her happy. He brings out the best in her. They get along like coffee and cream. Then the werewolf gene activates and Jacob turns into an emo, emotionally-driven nut job (can't Bella get away from these people? And why does she have to be one too?). And, of course, what transpires when Edward comes back is a bunch of posturing, werewolf-vampire-hating, etc. Bummer, dude. \n Still, Bella's trip to Italy and her meeting with the Volturi are what make the novel for me. Aro has to be one of Meyer's more ingenious creations... an ancient vampire with \"paper-thin white skin,\" an irritatingly creepy habit of being jovial all the time (though I suspect it's to throw people off his murderous tendencies), and an obsessive desire to \"collect\" talented vampires. I didn't know whether to laugh at his interview with Bella and Edward, or feel a cold chill blowing through the room. \n As usual, I skipped a lot of the purple prose and \"emotional vomit,\" but don't even get me started on Edward's suicidal tendencies. It's not romantic, dude... it's screwed up if you can't stand to live without someone. Bella yells at him for it, though, so I guess in the end it's ... yeah, no, it's so not cool, even then."}
{"text": "I really liked this book. While it's a book for those in 5th to 8th grade it was really a nice delight to read a fantasy book that was so nicely written for this age group. \n I found the little spider really enjoyable. And the fact that the storyline was taken from a real fairy tale was really a delightful element. \n Sometimes you did get a little frustrated with the character and wonder why she didn't think before she did stuff but again she was 12 and most 12 year olds probably think like she did. \n Over all I can't wait to read the next book in the series and I Hope that it is as nicely done as this one was."}
{"text": "what an utterly delightful treat."}
{"text": "6th&up? \n This ARC was obtained at BEA14, in exchange for an honest review. \n In a nod to The Prince and the Pauper, with a decidedly Russian twist, a poor peasant girl and a privileged aristocrat accidentally trade places and each embark on an amazing journey to return to their rightful places. \n Sigh. I wanted to like this book so much more than I did. Although it had its moments, the plot really didn't pick up until the last quarter when the League of Freed Prisoners (the major players in the novel) finally banded together. All around, this was a solid story with all the right elements and plenty of creative ideas, but something was missing. Maybe the remote nature of the narrator caused too much of a buffer between the reader and the characters? All I know is that while I was ultimately glad that I read the novel, I don't see a middle school student or teen reader sticking with this long enough to get really caught up."}
{"text": "Here it is the third brother in the Bowen Brothers Series - Dylan lived up to expectations from reading about his brothers Walker and Khan -- Dylan finds his mate in a rough and tough girl named Jack and she don't take no crap from anyone - a definite must read - this series is well worth it - would definitely recommend to others - can't wait to read about the next brother -- thank you Kathi S. Barton for an amazing read"}
{"text": "erudite, fun, but pet peeve: not really a complete novel. Definitely written so people will buy the sequel."}
{"text": "This is one of the best reading experiences I could have ever asked for. It's hilarious, heartfelt, and epic. Yes, this graphic novel is 1,300 pages, but it goes by so quickly. Very Tolkien-esque. If you love Lord of the Rings, Fantasy, Graphic Novels, or absolutely lovable heroes, do yourself a favor and pick up this book now."}
{"text": "I'm a huge sucker for anti-heroes like Locke Lamora, but I had a great time with this book. The pacing and storytelling were great. I appreciated how the author interlocked the main plot with applicable character histories. \n I don't seem to remember anything negative during the whole book, and my only issue is not having another Gentleman Bastards queued up for my next read. I'll see if can fix that before my commute home."}
{"text": "This story continues with the same feel as the previous book only upping the emotions quite a bit. \n In Unexpected Mate, Brian had fled to the town and found his mate Marcus, after been banished for being gay. In this story, Jason is running to his friend Brian, after being abused. There is lots of emotional conflict as Jason tries to reconcile his 'bonded' feelings for Alex with his distrust of men. \n Alex is the Alpha - big and strong - who has to go against all his instincts to give Jason the space he needs to heal. \n As with the first book, this series is light reading, perfect for when you want a quick read and don't want to think too much. Shifters, mating links, communicating mentally and healing through love. \n I publish all my m/m reviews on my blog so if you want to see all my m/m reviews in one place come visit at Because Two Men Are Better Than One!"}
{"text": "AMAZING BOOK. It is definitely a new favorite. I loved the retelling aspects, the characters, the world -- even the villain was deliciously evil. I loved it! \n I HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERYONE. (Well...maybe anyone ages 15&up)"}

{"text": "I really enjoyed this book. The world at times felt a little off but not in a bad way just not what the first book was like. I really get into this story I feel the characters are realistic and I'm just transported to the world that Snyder has made. I wanted to read it all in one sitting because it was that good."}
{"text": "Beautiful and even funny story! I'm very glad I went out of my regular genre and read it!"}
{"text": "I'm not really sure how to rate this... so I'm settling with 3 stars. \n One half of me felt that this was a beautiful sad love story deserving of 4 stars, but the other half wanted to throw down the book because I rather have a HEA for everyone involved making me want to give it 1 star since I felt robbed. This book by far is the most emotional I've felt in this series, I cried through 25% of the book. Although I was spoiled as to what happen here way before I read the book, I found myself enjoying Trez and Selena's love story immensely. It was beautiful even though it ended the way it did. I didn't know what to make of Selena from the previous book but I love her amazing spirit in this one. Her ability to embrace life is a strong and admirable quality. \n Trez and iAm is another love story in itself... The love and bond of brothers. One could not go on without the other. The little twist in their fate was interesting. \n The intensity I found with the earlier books was missing here. There were a lot of moments where questions were raised but nothing concrete was answered. I'm not exactly sure what's going on with Rhage, I guess Ward's next step of going back to the original brothers will answer it eventually. I was slowly warming up to Xcor and Layla until it took a different turn, not in a good way and was one of my book pet peeves. I want to know what's going to happen with Assail, Throe, and the Band of Bastards, and what they all mean for the Brotherhood. Two new characters are introduced for the new spinoff so I'm looking forward to it."}
{"text": "I was very fond of this book. It surprised me how easily I was sucked into the story. I find the cover a tad too simple for my personal taste but honestly it doesn't matter as it doesnt effect the story one bit. I would have preferred more build up between Ashling and Grey, anticipation makes a great story. I think I can safely say that I liked this book despite the things I liked less about them."}
{"text": "Awesome book. Very realistic. \n If only human race would be as helpful and kind to each other as they are in this book. \n in fact, I believe every school kid, who yells at their mommy about useless maths should read that book."}
{"text": "Forgive my Fins is a painfully predictable novel, in which I guessed the plotline in less than 5 pages. It was an extremely fast read, in which nothing even had a bit of depth. Not even the main characters. \n It's about a half-human/half-mermaid who lives on land and accidently gets \"bonded\" to the so-called obnoxious, arrogant boy next door who, SURPRISE, turns out to be her true love. A very common romance concept often daily applied to YA books. \n Now straight onto the painfully unbearable characters: \n Lily \n Lily was an annoying heroine. She was just plain shallow and even though she's sixteen years old, still calls her father \"Daddy\", which most teenagers incidentally do not do in real life. Typically, she has a crush on a surfer boy, coincidentally the most popular boy in school, whom she has no chance of ever getting together because we're talking about high school here. Can it be more cliche? \n Quince \n Quince was frustrating as well,he never ever saw what Lily for she was for- an over-protected, bratty Daddy's princess who hurt him daily. Instead he just fell for her, goodness knows why, and daydreamed about her for THREE years. \n Some of the characters were stereotypes stripped plain from society. Courtney for example, is the typical jealous, ex-girlfriend envious of the heroine. Brody- the typical, self-centered hottie who's the most popular boy. Dosinia- the spiteful, jealous cousin who despises the heroine. Very original. \n Oh, and of course the puns. Oh my god, how many puns can you insert into a novel. It reached the point of inducing vomit-worthy feelings in me. All that fishy terminology was making my head ache. Don't mistake me, I have an obssessive love for puns, but there is a fine line between overusing the puns and rocking them. \n All in all, I think this book could have used more angst, doesn't hurt you know, and the characters should have had a bit more depth. Not act like cardboard cut-outs."}
{"text": "2,5 stelline \n Dopo aver letto l'ultima pagina mi vien da dire: allora? Tutto questo marasma per cosa? 300 e passa pag. per comunicarmi solo questo? Mah! \n Ricordo ancora,piuttosto bene,cosa mi trasmise il primo capitolo di questa trilogia: una dolcezza sconfinata,racchiusa in frasi,che sembravano piccoli versi di poesie...uno stile delicato,scorrevole quindi perfetto nella sua semplicita. \n Credo che questo secondo capitolo,sia caduto nella trappola del \"libro di mezzo\" o \"maledizione del 2 libro\",chiamiamo la come vogliamo,ma la Hudson non solo ha proseguito in maniera poco chiara la storia,ma ha di fatto creato come si suol dire \"tanto rumore per nulla\". \n La trama viene ripetutamente stravolta dalle continue allucinazioni,smaterializzazioni ed incubi di Amelia,che mi spiace dirlo e confusa ed indecisa per tutto il libro.Joshua,che avevo adorato nel primo capitolo,adesso sembra un burattino,incapace di agire o reagire in qualsivoglia situazione. \n I presunti antagonisti o pseudo nemici...insomma i \"cattivoni\" convincono poco e appena Amelia si surriscalda,assomigliando ad una supernova che non a Casper,loro corrono via...ma un po' di spina dorsale no? \n Creature oscure e provenienti da chissa quale universo oscuro??? \n Ma per favore... \n Fino alla meta del libro ho sperato,che la Hudson tirasse fuori \"il colpaccio di scena\" o qualsiasi altra cosa,che potesse rendere la trama piu interessante e non scontata e tremendamente prevedibile,come di fatto si e rivelata. \n Continui salti temporali e/o spaziali,che non solo riuscivano a creare confusione,ma non chiarivano le questioni in sospeso.All'ultima pagina mi sono trovata a pensare,che se non avessi letto questo secondo capitolo,riuscirei ugualmente a collegare i fatti del primo al terzo libro,magari con un prologo di poche pagine,che giustifichi il nuovo status di Amelia. \n Anche se scritto abbastanza bene,in questo capitolo la Hudson riesce a comunicare ben poco,perdendo di fatto quello stile semplice,delicato e poetico,che aveva contraddistinto il primo volume! \n Peccato avevo sperato in qualcosa di decisamente diverso... \n Ora su Elegy ricadranno tutte le mie speranze,magari la Hudson sapra riscattarsi e ci regalera un finale degno del primo volume!"}
{"text": "As you can probably tell from my bookshelves, Bay of Sighs has a little bit of everything. Some of it seemed recycled from previous Nora Roberts books. But even when the story is familiar, no one can tell it like Nora. This trilogy is centered on a quest for three stars that have been hidden for many years. The stars were created by three goddesses to celebrate the new queen. But an evil goddess put a curse on the stars and they fell to Earth. Now, she seeks to find them so that she can use their power to rule the universe. However, six mortals (OK, five mortals and one immortal) with unique gifts and powers are also on a quest. Their mission is to return the stars to the goddesses so that they can be restored to the heavens. This is book two of the trilogy and is not a stand alone story. It would be best to read Stars of Fortune first. The third book, Island of Glass, will not be available until December, 2016. I hope that I still remember enough of the complicated plot when that one is published. I suspect that this series would be better experienced as a binge-read."}
{"text": "I had fairly low expectations for this one. I mean, I quite enjoyed the previous two, but Sydney's bland and frustrating (especially in comparison to Rose), and from what I'd heard the series was losing speed; my friends were losing interest and I braced myself for something \"average\". \n Surprisingly enough, I found myself loving it. I was hooked. The plot was a little predictable, but the banter and the characters felt... well, real. Natural. It made me chuckle more than the previous two Bloodlines books had, and the characters weren't as frustratingly stereotypical as they'd once been. Hell, even Jill has a personality, now! (sorry.) \n Despite what I'd been told, I thought the story actually picked up the pace quite drastically, compared to the other two. Sydney is evolving and I can finally relate to her. If the other two books I was only reading for Adrian, the new Alchemist plot lines are intriguing enough that I'll be eagerly waiting for the next one in the series. \n Oh, and, last but not least? It seems the series is back on its pedestal of wonderfully-written UST. About time."}
{"text": "There's good, fun, creative fantasy weird and then there's lame, contrived, fantasy weird. I only read 60 pages of this but it seemed to fall into the latter category."}
{"text": "The unnamed narrator goes to sleep in 1890 London after attending a socialist meeting and wakes up in the same room hundreds of years in the future. While he was sleeping, Britain has been transformed into a utopia, where everybody is free to do exactly as he or she pleases but most people, fortunately, like to do lots and lots of hard work. Most people have taken to living simple yet comfortable lives in the country, often in semi-communal situations. People take real pride in crafting beautiful yet useful clothing and furniture, cooking each other tasty yet nutritious meals, and fixing up the most pleasing of the old historic homes. (Any buildings which were deemed ugly or vulgar have long since been torn down, except for the Parliament building, which is now, humorously enough, being using as a manure storage facility.) \n There is much to like about the utopian society that Morris has invented. All people are regarded as equal, and there is no formal government to rebel against or money to cause social friction. All jobs are viewed as equally valid, and people are happy to take turns doing the more menial tasks. Since machines have been abolished, there is no pollution to speak of, and people live long and healthy lives. The only trouble that routinely occurs is when a love triangle is formed, and then the usual remedy is for the losing party to move away to another town for a time. \n However, there are also some parts of this society that might be hard for us to endorse. Although women are treated well and are free to make their own decisions, there is a definite division of labor by sex, with women usually employed in cooking and sewing and men usually doing outdoor tasks. Also, the lack of emphasis on book learning could be hard to take for those of us who have devoted our lives to such pursuits!"}

{"text": "Rating: 3.5 \n This was going to get 3 stars but the ending with Will was one of the most beautiful things I'd ever read, so I thought I'd add half a point just for that. The problem with this series in my opinion is that it is just so heavy on the romance and drama. This is really what the books are about. Beyond that, there isn't much of an intriguing storyline. The writing is good but it felt everything was designed in a way to elicit sadness and tears out of the reader and it just didn't work for me. It was very melodramatic and it had me rolling my eyes quite a few times. I wanted a better plot, a more suspenseful story beyond the romance but it wasn't there. It was a nice read but I think the series is just really overrated."}
{"text": "I've read Fangirl and LOVED it, so I thought I would like it's companion novel. I did like it, but it took a while for me to get into it. Like over 150 pages... I thought about putting it down, but I'm glad that I didn't. After 200 pages, I couldn't put it down! It finally got to the good bits that we got tidbits of in Fangirl. It's good on its own, but I don't think a reader would get as much out of it if they hadn't read Fangirl yet."}
{"text": "What if Death had a daughter? What if her mother tried to expel her from her womb with a potion? What if it left her scarred... and with a gift of dealing out death? \n It's a good book; it moves fast, it has terrific main characters, and it kept me turning the pages. My only problem with it is keeping some of the characters straight, and there were moments when details caught me off guard, since I imagined certain things and characters differently than the author later described them. However, since I was reading two books at once, the missing details may simply have been oversight on my part."}
{"text": "Really enjoyed this quick read."}
{"text": "Lover Avenged is action packed and moves quickly between a number of intertwined stories. Lots of hot vampires with drama, action and sizzling romance. \n The prime focus is on Rehvenge and his relationship with Ehlena. It continues to amaze me how J.R. Ward can develop characters, who you think you should really dislike based on their actions, but you can't help but feel differently. Rehvenge is one of these. Although he is a drug dealer with dark past, it was heart-breaking when he felt he didn't deserve Ehlena. \n My other favourite from the series, John Matthew, features in this story which transitions nicely into the next book."}
{"text": "It is hard to believe that this brilliant book is by a first-time author. It is beautiful and horrible and absolutely spell-binding. The story is set on an estate at the edge of the Russian wilderness. I'm not sure of the time-frame since this is a fable - probably about 500 years ago. Although the family of Pyotr Vladimirovich is wealthy by local standards and has powerful connections in Moscow, they too suffer through the long and brutal winters. But the people have survived with the aid of their household spirits. The story opens before our heroine, Vasilisa is born. Her mother dies giving birth to this special child who will inherit talents passed down from her grandmother. As Vasya grows into a rebellious child, her father becomes convinced that she needs the influence of a mother to tame her into more conventional behavior. He strikes a bargain with the Grand Prince of Moscow that secures a lesser prince for Vasya's older sister but requires that he marry the Grand Prince's mad sister. The step-mother had wanted to join a convent and, with the assistance of a new priest, forces the household and villagers to forsake the old spirits and worship God alone. No one but Vasya seems to realize that this is the reason for the increasingly harsh weather, famine and the mysterious violent deaths that soon plague their community. The book opens with a fairy tale (which you should definitely pay attention to) but evolves into a horror story. The tension and danger build gradually. I found a glossary at the end of the book that might have come in handy earlier. And I sometimes found myself somewhat confused because Russians tend to call themselves by more than one name. But these are minor matters that did not detract from this spell-binding book. It will be a tough act for Ms. Arden to follow but I certainly hope that she has more stories planned. I am a fan."}
{"text": "I have to say I started reading book three as soon as I was done book two,that's how intrigued and captivated I was with the story. I so wanted to know what was going to happen and where it was going to go. I have to say chapter one was very attention grabbing and had me glued. The whole book is sooooo good! \n In this book the evil is building and is taking control. Those who are good are trying to fight back but are slowly being squeezed at every turn. The characters are well done. Stilghan - nasty, nasty and the Madroch - so real, they'll scare you and keep you from wanting to look anyone in the eye for a while. Meaghan has so grown through all three books and is now thrust into the role of leader. \n The suspense was so well done. Stilghan uses whatever means he needs to to bend Caide to his will. He wants to control Caide as he's a spellmaster and he wants him to do his nasty deeds. You're praying that Meaghan and her team can get to him in time but the tension is nerve-wracking and will keep you turning the pages. Honestly there are parts where you can't turn the pages fast enough with wanting to know where the story is going and other parts you'll want to read slowly and savor the heart-warming moments. \n Seriously, you'll be thinking about the characters, the setting, the storyline, when you're not reading it. Brilliantly done. Very well written and tightly woven. I am so looking forward to book 4. Hint-Hint Ms. Taber. :) I definitely recommend this book and this series. I was given a copy as part of a book tour."}
{"text": "See full review for Etiquette & Espionage at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n Sophronia is a wreck of trouble for her mother, even at the tender age of fourteen. She reads. She climbs. She even takes things apart to figure out how they work. Not something girls at that age in 1851 England should behave. That is why her mother has decided to take extreme measures and has elected a finishing school to take care of her. But something is amiss. While on the way to said finishing school - Mademoiselle Geraldine's Finishing Academy for Young Ladies of Quality - the carriage is waylaid by flyway man (think highwayman who can fly) and they seem to be looking for something. \n Sophronia with the help of the others in the carriage, take off and make it the school, but even the school is odd. It's location is top secret because it floats. And as Sophronia quickly finds out, they're not just teaching etiquette at this school, but something more. Like espionage."}
{"text": "I enjoyed this book far more than the first one. I think perhaps it was due to the constant action in this book, the story nor the characters disappoint. \n Both Harlow and Augustine grow throughout the story with Harlow becoming more accepting of her Fae identity and attempts to develop lasting relationships with various characters; while Augustine is assuming the role of Guardian and protecting New Orleans to best of his ability. Aside from the main characters, the supporting cast develops into their own and helps explain the Fae world to both Harlow and the reader. \n A downfall of this book, would be the developing relationship between Harlow and Augustine, it seems very juvenile in nature, especially since they are both adults. \n I am looking forward to the completion of the trilogy and hopefully any lose ends will be addressed. Overall a good read with a 3.5/5 rating. \n I received this as an arc through Netgalley."}
{"text": "I can't recommend this one unless you are on a mission to read every Tim Powers book. It is an interesting story and as usual, Powers comes up with clever supernatural elements woven into the regular world of L.A. with its endless series motels, strip malls, and homeless people. This will entertain you, to be sure, but it didn't satisfy me. I kept asking, \"why? Why all the twists? Why am I reading this?\" It could be that this genre of \"Urban Fantasy\" just isn't for me, though I keep trying."}
{"text": "This prequel was simply perfect...sweet, but short , and still complete. \n **Full review to come**"}
{"text": "I loved this book, it had everything: a great main character, strong and smart, an interesting plot, intrigue, a love story that wasn't the focus of the whole thing, some superpowers and some funny but loyal sidekicks. \n The pacing was nice. It wasn't fast paced, but I didn't get bored. \n The things I didn't like were that the \"bad guys\" were absolutely bad, they were twisted ad sadics, and felt a little flat. I hoped there was more of a twist, that there was some sort of traitor, but it was really predictable. \n Also, the commander ways seem really extreme, not making any exception EVER doesn't seem realistic. Also, he turning out to be a woman seemed irrelevant and I don't feel it was explored correctly. \n Valek was also a great character. Strong, smart, loyal but also secretive. I definitively want more Valek! \n The books does have some cruelty and hard things. It is not for everyone."}
{"text": "I picked this book up based on the subtitle touting it as \"The Definitive Steampunk Anthology\", which will teach me to believe cover blurbs instead of checking reviews! I am not terribly familiar with steampunk, but I think that this collection, while interesting, is highly unlikely to be definitive. Then again, I didn't even read all of it, so perhaps I missed a shining gem. \n What I did read was a mixed bag. The good: \n \"Static\" by Marly Youmans combined fantastic world-building with fairy-tale retelling and did it well. I really liked this story and intend to track down more of this author's work immediately. \n \"Machine Maid\" by Margo Lanagan was very, very creepy, mostly in a good way, and the use of the Australian frontier caught my attention, accustomed as I am to American frontier stories. \n \"Speed, Speed the Cable\" by Kage Baker suffered from an ending that lacked all punch, at least for someone like me not well-versed in Victorian historical personages. The body of the story was quite interesting, though. \n \"Hannah\" by Keith Brooke packed a good punch into the end, but the story was only just barely interesting enough to carry me to it. \n The bad: \n \"Elementals\" by Ian R. MacLeod was pointless, and I loathed the main character and his attitude toward all of the other characters. Also, this grammatical construction bothered me immensely: \"As I've already said, I have no precise recollection of this first mention of his theory of elementals. Mostly likely, it would have swirled up with many other thoughts and suppositions. Equally likely, it would have been at our club, and probably at that time in the evening when things had started to become enjoyable blurred.\" \n The ugly: \n \"Steampunch\" by James Lovegrove was the opening story in this collection, and it begins like this: \"Hoi! Hoi, you! Yes, you, kid. Over here. I want a word. No, don't look like that. I'm not some poncey mandrake, though there's a fair few of them around here, I warn you. I won't be trying to stick my Nebuchadnezzar up your jacksie. Strictly a Lady Laycock fellow, me, always have been.\" So...that would be a no, then. \n The unknown: \n There were six more stories left, but -- okay, I can't actually type \"I ran out of steam\" with a straight face. Sorry!"}
{"text": "I had heard of this series,but not really paid much attention to it until my 11-year old nephew recommended it to me. And I'm glad that he did. I listened to the audio book and although I did zone out from time to time, I really enjoyed it. \n The premise is that two recently orphaned girls discover that they are the descendants of one of the Brothers Grimm. Unbeknownst to them, they do have a grandmother and she is ready to bring them to Fairyport Landing to live happily ever after. Like with any good fairy tale, it's not that easy and the girls find themselves knee deep in mystery and intrigue. \n The author has brought together characters from all over...several characters from the Brothers Grimm of course, but other fantasy figures like Alice in Wonderland, Dorothy from Oz, and King Arthur make appearances. Some might consider the book saturated with fantasy characters, but I found it fun as each character entered the story. \n If you're a teacher and doing a study of traditional literature and fantasy, I think this book would be a great read aloud within the unit. And some kids will latch on to it, wanting to read the entire series."}

{"text": "Harry is such a perfect teenager in this book! He's whiny and self-important, snapping at everyone else, and thinking that 'no one understands meeeeeeeee!\" Jeesh. So at times it was difficult to read because of the wanting to smack him upside the head, but that's really quite a testament to Rowling's knowledge of her own characters and her understanding of how people (especially adolescents) can change. \n Another reason this was a difficult read was that I don't like change. And there's change all over this book. Yes, it starts on Pivet Drive and all that, but Hagrid is missing from a huge portion of the book, and then he's secretive with Harry, Ron and 'Hermy' for the rest. Dumbledore is ousted as headmaster for a while, Harry gets kissed by Cho, and Cho is all crying all over the place. It's awkward and difficult and horrifying. Just like a teenager's life should be."}
{"text": "This is by no means a lighthearted read. It is full of the savagery of a savage time, and Haggard's detail is beyond what some might be willing to stomach in a \"pleasure\" read. Having said that, I enjoyed this book, though I will advise you not to read it while recouping in the hospital after surgery. My big mistake. It is steeped in history as are all of Haggard's works. It is one of the many things I love about his books. He is a storyteller extraordinaire."}

The Moth in the Mirror follows Morpheus as he tries to figure out a way into Alyssa's heart by going through her human beloved's memories. In Six Impossible Things we are treated to an interesting sight, as Alyssa finally sheds her human life and becomes Wonderland's Queen with Morpheus at her side. \n I won't lie, the only reason I wanted to read this companion novel was for the short story Six Impossible Things, because I was really curious to see what happened to Alyssa after the epilogue in Ensnared. I wasn't too disappointed, but I'm jumping ahead of myself..."}

{"text": "See full review for Tiger's Curse at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n Kelsey has just graduated from high school and is on the prowl to find a summer job, something that will give her experience so that when the new school year rolls around she can find an even better one to help pay for her tuition. The only place hiring though is a traveling circus and they need her help for various tasks. One of which involves a tiger. Instead of being afraid of the beast though, she finds herself drawn to it and connects with it in a way she hasn't connected with anyone since her parents died. \n But it's not to be. Her time at the circus is coming to a close and the tiger is sold to a wealthy man in India. However, something strange happens. The man who came to pick up the tiger from the circus offers Kelsey a job to help escort the tiger to the new owner. Figuring it would look good on her resume and because she doesn't want to be separated from the tiger - named Ren - just yet she agrees and starts a most interesting journey of her life. \n I'll admit that when I started this book I was a little wary. I don't like taking chances on books all that often and this one didn't seem to be one that was up my alley. But after reading the summary and a glowing recommendation from one of the coaches at work I put it on my reading list. And I am really, really glad that I did. What starts out as a sort of cutesy human/tiger bonding sessions turns to fantasy as Ren turns from a tiger into a man and back again."}

{"text": "4.5 stars for this contemporary paranormal romance. \n Lily is a 28 y/o single woman working in her grandparents' convenience store when she begins to have visions. They are terrifying, and nightmares keep her awake at night. Visiting the site of her recurrent dream, Lily is attacked by a vampire--and rescued by Christian, a Sentient. He tells Lily that she is like himself--and there are others she needs to meet. \n Enfolded into a small Georgia town, Lily joins Abram, William, Christian and Anna (among others) who all have gifts allowing them to see and destroy evil. Lily's gift is as an empath, and a Pathcrosser--one who can assist lost souls cross to the other side. \n Lily and Christian become fast friends, and he warns her to stay away from William--who happens to be a vampire--with a soul, and his humanity. It's a mite complicated, but William is really a good dude, and he's uber-helpful training Lily to focus her powers. Christian hates William out-of-hand because he hates all vamps-they killed his dad. Lily's conflicted--she's terrified of William and attracted to him, too. She knows having any sort of relationship with William will alienate Christian, but as time (months) go by, both William and Lily are struggling to keep their mutual attraction from combusting all over the group. \n In the meantime, Lily learns to harness her power, and the entire group prepares to destroy a vampire infestation near to Lily's home town. It's a big trouble when Lily and William reveal their love, and especially considering Christian's reaction. \n I liked this story. Lily's not a dimwit, and she's not entirely likable--at first. She makes snap judgments and allows her loyalty to be swayed by prejudice. It's a lot for her to get over, and her guilt is plentiful. I liked how she wasn't great with her powers--at first and even after some practice. She felt very relatable--and I like that in a character. William is a big ball of yum. He is virtually isolated, barely tolerated, by some of the group members, and never anticipates having his affection for Lily returned. It's so engaging to witness his vulnerability. Christian is a horse's pa-toot a good part of the book, but his redemption is awesome, and touching. \n This is a great start to a paranormal series, with a clear ending and a storyline to continue."}

I really love this website and am having so much fun being involved in Goodreads.

Like 'hey shouldn't six pack hunk vampire so-and-so have mind reading abilities crap this sucks! Silly me. But hey I'm riding with the story whatever.

I've already started to read the second book so I'm invested enough to want to see the story progress but as the main female character was doing something stupid, I was like, \"Stop being dumb and selfish and use your brains!\" And that's when I realized I didn't really like her."}

So she and her best friend run away to a little town, just barely outside the kingdom's grasp. And that's when her new life starts. \n Lia is a character that I liked. I didn't agree with all her choices, but she's smart and she stands up for herself. I also enjoyed her friendship with Pauline and the other women that work at the inn. It is nice to see women helping and caring for each other. We got to stick together! \n We've got two other pov: The Prince and The Assassin, both interested in our heroine. We also have two names, Rafe and Kaden, but we don't know who is who. And I have to say, I guessed wrong. I really thought she had fallen for the assassin, but I was glad Rafe was the Prince. It's the simpler way, but who cares? \n At first I cared more for Kaden than Rafe, and didn't get why Lia favored Rafe.

It ends in a huge cliffhanger, and I can't wait to see how the story continues!"}

She's the daughter of a Commoner and a Patron who is the country's greatest war hero. She is a mule. People look down at her because of what she is. But on the court of Fives, she is equal to everyone else as long as she has the skill. She does and on the eve of the biggest challenge of her life, her father comes home from battle ruining her plans. The next day she was supposed to run at the trials, but she can't with her father in attendance. However, she still wants to and comes up with a plan to do the unthinkable. \n She runs and almost wins, except at the last possible second she falters. The winner has to unmask and her father will know it was her. So she lets the person ahead of her win. It was a dumb move because that person was Kalliarkos, a noble Patron, and he does not like to win by cheating. He promises to keep her secret, only it doesn't matter. For his uncle, Lord Gargaron, already knows and uses his knowledge in an alarming way. He funds Jes's father, which will give him a higher position, but there are conditions. First, he has to leave Jes's mother and sisters and marry Gargaron's niece. Second, Jes has to go to Gargaron Stable - a training facility for the Fives - and do well or else. Much to Jes's shock, her father agrees to his terms and she is sent on an interesting ride where she gets her heart desire, but at a price. \n So Court of Fives is really confusing. There is a good story there, buried beneath bazillion names that are hard to keep track of (and hard to spell) and a million details that don't seem advantageous to the plot."}
{"text": "4.5 Stars \n Laurie lives a nondescript life, working as a bartender in a restaurant and lamenting the miserable state of her family-life. Turns out her parents will not speak with her, or permit her any contact with her younger siblings. She tries to fill this void with two girlfriends, but has a terrible secret to hide from them--and everyone: when Laurie loses her temper stuff catches fire. Numerous pyrotechnic events have led to her estrangement, but Laurie's been spark-free going on three years. Well, at least until meeting Mikhail Petrov. Just being in proximity to Mikhail is enough for Laurie's body to light up--and not in the good way. \n Mikhail is a Tri-Elemental, he can control air, earth and water, but he needs a fire Elemental in order to achieve Balance. His most recent partner, Corrine, is nearing the end of her usefulness. He's also a local magistrate, of sorts, controlling/monitoring the movements and activities of Elementals, Mages and Darks (vampire-like magic-bearing creatures) within his tri-state territory. Misha, as Mikhail's close friends call him, had survived years of servitude to Mages before ascending to his current power rank. As an young Elemental, he'd been easy prey for powerful Mages in the past, but his wealth of experience, his own power and coupling with Laurie's Incandescent strength will enable Misha to establish a new elemental world order, one which will banish enslavement of Elementals and Darks to Mages. \n Pulling Laurie's power, however, has unforeseen effects. Instead of simply enhancing the magical strength of Misha's borders, he ends up in a land-grab with all new Mages on his tail. It's okay--for now. Misha's alwasy had his eye on bigger and better things, after all. \n Laurie is not happy. She's hunted by Mages all looking to enslave her and steal her power. Staying with Misha is the best of a bad situation, and she wants out. Of course, every time she leaves, or tries to leave, another supernatural problem befalls her. \n She does manage to make a very powerful friend in her own right--Mina, a Dark who travels through shadow-portals--is daughter the the Dark leader and niece to the Mage Executive. By means of a blood tie, Mina assures Laurie life--because killing Laurie would also kill Mina, and her family is fiercely protective. \n This comes in super handy when Misha gets double-crossed and the Mages finally kidnap Laurie. It's a showdown of the Big Bads and there's an ocean of supernatural blood spilled. Mina had hope to prevent the brewing war, but Laurie's Incandescent luck might have just created a firestorm--one which could take down herself, Mina and Misha in one fell swoop. \n This is an interesting twist on the paranormal genre. I liked the idea of a partnership, and empathized (to an extent) with Laurie's desire to return to normal. It becomes so clear, so quickly, how unlikely it is for this to happen, unfortunately. Instead of wasting time being obtuse, Laurie could have been better embracingher predicament and figuring out how to best save her skin while under Misha's protection. I liked how she was clueless, at first, and honed her skills under Misha's critical eye. This could have become the stereotypical romance--where the attraction is instant and the progression to coupledom is rapid. Not the case, here. Sure, there's some attraction, but it is far outweighed by Laurie's wariness. She and Misha spend weeks-to-months in training together before there is any physicality. \n The large cast and interesting creature types marked this world as different from other paranormal/supernatural books I've read, and the plot moved along nicely. By the end I could really sense the anguish of Misha, Laurie and Mina, as those they love are sacrificed in the name of power. It's a cool read, and I look forward to the next installment."}

The world building in this book is absolutely phenomenal. I felt totally immersed in the Mistborn universe. The amount of effort that must have gone into sketching out the geographical, political, social, and religious aspects of this world must have been immense. Somehow this book manages to contain a great wealth of descriptive detail without bogging down a very fast paced narrative. \n This book also contains the most sophisticated discussion of magic use I have ever encountered, in any medium. Everything having to do with allomancy is endlessly fascinating. This book provides a unique and gratifying description of how magic works, and how its various practitioners fit Ito the Final Empire. The magic system is both impressively unique and yet intuitively plausible. I was so impressed by the care used to create the magic rules. \n On top of all of that, this book had great character development and was incredibly thought provoking. The characters are relatable and sympathetic without being flawless. This is a very nuanced, morally complex story. \n This is compulsively readable. Once you pick it up you will never want to put it down again. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Read it!"}

{"text": "A solid read. Effective escapism, with good intrigue, and excellent descriptions of assassins doing their assassing. My only real issue with this book is the predictability of the characters, they all seem to get wound up and set on an ethical path, and you are just waiting for the inevitable moral block to be placed in front of them so they will spin off the direction you know they must. By about a third of the way through the book I was dreading bad things happening to the main character because I knew it would lead to another breathless Morrissey-esque How Could This Be fest on his part. That said, he is in that period a young adult coming to terms with his life, and I'm sure I was at least as whiny, and I wasn't raised as a guild rat in a horrible slum with an assassin as my only father figure, so I give some leeway. \n The best summary of my feelings on this book is that I picked it up on a whim based largely on the cover art, I got about what I anticipated, and I went back and am reading book 2 in the series now."}
{"text": "Maggie Stiefvater's writing is so vibrant and makes my heart feel like it's being squeezed to death.

I had so many questions and wanted Grace to fight and push more for answers and a cure, but there was just a lot of love and being together- which was beautiful, but there was surprising little tension and action in most parts of this book.

I know it was meant to be lighthearted, but it felt jarring and didn't work with the rest of the story. \n That being said, I am not turned off of the series in general.

{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n First, an important note about the audiobook: I knew I was in a bit of trouble when the starting credits announced that the book was \"performed\" (not \"narrated,\" not \"read\") by Fred Berman. And true to the \"performance,\" Berman was frequently a bit of a ham. It made some of Hill's cheesier dialogue even cheesier. But I got used to rolling my eyes and by the end of it I was okay with the reading. \n Now, I'd had this on my to-read shelf for a bit but inched it up once I found out from the Neil Gaiman interview with Stephen King (a really nice interview) that Hill is King's son. I think that even if I'd not known that I would have noticed the similarities in their styles, especially the way both writers overuse pop culture references (mostly musical) and the aforementioned cheesy dialogue. But I can't say that I didn't enjoy it, and don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of King. But he's not a perfect writer and neither is his son. But Hill has written a supernatural mystery crossed with a revenge story, and both are pretty successful. \n My biggest beef is with the reason Lee Tourneau is impervious to Ig's horns at the start. The reason Hill gives is that Merrin's cross, which eventually becomes something Ig, himself, uses to hide his horns from others, has a kind of magic. But it would have been so much more interesting if Hill had gone with the more simple, logical, and real explanation: Lee doesn't react to the horns because Lee has no guilt. He's a textbook sociopath, free of a conscience. The devil's horns can't elicit something that is simply nonexistent. I think that in this setting and in this story a sociopath makes a really interesting character (and one I'd have liked explored just a bit further). But Hill didn't use the sociopathy for its obvious implications, and that disappointed me. \n I also could have done without the \"treehouse of the mind.\" It felt a bit unnecessary, needlessly complicated. But Hill's take on and exploration of the devil and evil is original and interesting, so I was okay with some of my minor issues."}

Entre las cosas buenas tenemos: la primera parte del libro donde se nos presenta a los personajes principales con una narracion muy fluida y algunos elementos muy bien disenados como el bosque, los caminantes, la torre, el corazon del bosque, la corrupcion y alguna pocion por ahi; y por otro lado que la historia es autoconclusiva. Entre las malas tenemos un sistema de magia realmente ridiculo (a base de hechizos que podria pronunciar cualquiera y que no suponen ningun coste fisico) y ademas muy abundante, llegando a resultar cansino e infantil. Hay varios personajes decorativos que no aportan nada; el mayor ejemplo de esto es la mejor amiga de la protagonista, Kasia que llega a resultar insufrible. La quimica entre los protagonistas Agnieszka y Sarkan (el dragon) es practicamente nula y destaca por el abuso, cercano al maltrato, que el dragon ejerce sobre ella (pocas bromas con este tema). La trama esta alargada en exceso (le sobran como doscientas paginas) \n Si liman todos estos malos detalles se podria hacer una buena pelicula que supongo no van a tardar en llevar a cabo y que yo vere con gusto y que puede que sea uno de los pocos casos en que supere en calidad al libro porque visualmente tiene mucho potencial."}

I think he is amazing and yes he is a huge jackass and just makes Aelin look and feel so weak but that soon changes don't you guys worry ;). We get the two best friends of Celaena and Rowan by the end of the book and there is a huge face-off between Celaena and Rowan against Queen Maeve. It was pretty epic and some shit does go down! \n I felt like this whole book was just all the male characters getting over Celaena and finding their own path instead of following hers. Dorian comes through some huge changes now that his magic is manifesting on it's own! Chaol has to deal with his rotten father and try to get over the fact that Celaena is the Queen of fae and could potentially kill them all. Aedion Ashryver, Celaena's cousin and childhood best friend, seemed to be a huge asshole at first with all of these smirks and deadly smiles but soon we find out that's not all he really is. He plays a huge role in helping Celaena win back her crown and take over! We get a lot of flashbacks and memories and they are all so sad, I really felt bad for Celaena and what she went through with her dead parents and Arobynn taking her. \n The end was amazing! The huge battle in Celaena's chapters were huge!!!! Rowan really showed his intimacy and caring for Celaena when they are together fighting side by side with even Rowan's friends who are like 1000 years old. It was intense and it made a great segway into the next book. This book in general was probably my favourite out of all of them that are out! It was fantastic and amazing well-written! \n IF you lied this review, check out more on my blog where I review YA and other genre books! \n http://keepcalmandloveboooks.blogspot.ca"}
{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n I was obsessed with this movie as a child, and though I couldn't understand the themes at the time, I almost think some of its meaning and heart swept into my subconscious somehow. Reading this tale felt familiar and yet totally new. \n As an adult, I see the Last Unicorn as an allegory about time, specifically, the unique way that humans interpret their existence based on time. At the beginning of the story, the unicorn is immortal and lives in the present moment. She does not know her age, experience regret, or have distinct memories. All of the humans, however, are controlled in one way or another by time. There are those who seek to hold on to time through greed and attachment (Haggard), those who can not enjoy what they have in the present because they might lose it in the future (the Hagsgate villagers), those who fear growing old (Molly Grue), and those who can't \"grow up\" (Schmendrick). And, of course, there is a skeleton who teaches us that \"the right time\" is an illusion. In the end, the unicorn-turned woman-turned unicorn shows us the gift of mortality, for only an enlightened being who understands the limits of time can really appreciate how precious life truly is--in its beauty and its pain. \n Extra bonus: self-aware \"meta\" moments and unexpected humor add a little levity!"}
{"text": "I liked it much more than the first one to be honest. And the ending had me emotional - when I didn't think I would be. Pretty good book :)"}
{"text": "I'm surprised, but, I LOVED this! I mean, I've only read two other plays written by Shakespeare (Romeo and Juliet & Othello, both for school) and they were o.k. I didn't really like them. But wow. This play. 5 stars out of 5. The language was gorgeous and flowing, it read like poetry! I actually liked the characters AND while reading it, all I could think about was that Suite Life of Zack and Cody episode based solely on this play. Absolutely brilliant. Also, I loved that this play wasn't a tragedy . I don't think I could have handled it if it was. Lysander was so dreamy, and there was about to be a LEGIT cat fight in this play! It also doesn't hurt that the version of this book that I own has translations on the left pages. It allowed me to actually understand this play."}
{"text": "Damon by Teresa Gabelman \n I just finished reading Damon and it was great - I couldn't put it down! I liked how it was between Damon and Nicole. A great beginning to a series. A good mix of humor, romance, mystery, and horror. I would recommend this book as a cuddle up for a cold evening with a warm blanket and fireplace. Lots of fresh ideas for the topic of vampires and humans."}
{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n Kill your best friend, find out your alternate universe self is pretty much Miss Perfect, which you certainly are not. Also, parents in any universe create the exact same offspring. A little far-fetched. I was with Swank until the end, though, and I am not someone who reads books all the way through if they're not well-written."}
{"text": "Every book in Lindsay Buroker's Emperor's Edge series is a delight. Protagonist Amaranthe shows courage as she leads her motley team in defense of the deposed Emperor. Buroker's characters are well rounded, consistent and complement each other. The steampunk world and the politics of power-mongering become clearer as the stories progress. Action and reflection balance and ground the plot, and the pacing is just right. As well, the romance between Amaranthe and the Assassin shows up just enough to twig our interest but does not take over the whole story, and this love relationships moves through reasonable and heart-warming developments as time goes on. I heartily recommend this book and the entire series to those who love a good story and care about the clash of good and evil."}
{"text": "Where to start with this... Vampire Academy is just a classic. Everyone knows it and mostly everyone has read it. It starts off with Lissa, a vampire princess, and her best friend Rose, a half-vamp half-human guardian in training. They are on the run from their school, St. Vladimir's Academy in Montana. They escaped because Lissa wasn't feeling safe anymore considering she is the last Dragomir alive, in her whole line. The Strigoi, the vampires who choice evil and the strongest kind, are more than ever persistent on making Lissa one of them. Lissa and Rose get caught by the oh so cute-love interest, Dimitri, who just so happens to be a guard at St. Vlad's and one of the best fighters known to man. Lets just say Rose isn't any happier than Lissa is to be dragged back, considering Rose still thinks the danger is inside the school itself. \n Mead really did a good job with her characters. They are all so well developed and fit so nicely in the plot, it's almost seamless. \n Rose is a very aggressive, free spirited and dedicated person who loves Lissa like no other. Rose has this intense dedication towards protecting Lissa, it's insane and so nice to read about. She slowly gets back into things at St. Vlad's such as training, maturity, and more focused on her studies a.k.a Strogoi killing for Dummies. \n Lissa is the dainty, sweet, charming, and smart princess. Instead of being the stereotypical 'not a care in the world' princess, she's smart and calculating. Also since she lost her parents and brother in a car crash, she's grown stronger and more independent. The big question she has to ask herself is, why wasn't she or Rose dead from the accident and her parents and brother were? \n Dimitri is the ultimate badass, perfect for Rose. He's the top guard at St. Vlad who was tasked with retrieving the girls, since for 2 years they couldn't find them. He's a Russian dhampir with a lot of experience killing Strigoi. He slowly gets to learn about Rose and her life, as he is the one who convinced the headmistress to let her stay in school, only if he'd be the one to train her. Privately ;). You can imagine the straight connection when he realizes just how smart and dedicated Rose is. \n I really liked the romance in this book, I felt like it was natural and well-paced. Considering the circumstances, with her being his student and all, it was definitely enjoyable and not in your face. The humour was also very much there, Rose is a hilarious character and isn't afraid to speak her mind, which isn't always nice haha. These books are a must read and definitely a staple in your collection! \n IF you liked this review, check out more YA and other genre reviews on my blog \n http://keepcalmandloveboooks.blogspot.ca"}
{"text": "See full review for Need at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n Usually when I start a new book, I take a quick glance at the reviews on Goodreads. Sometimes by reading those reviews I get a small idea of what to expect from this book and the probability of whether or not I'm going to like what I read. I also take those reviews with a grain of salt because not everybody likes the same kind of style, genres, etc. that I do. But when it came to Need, I think I should have listened to the reviews. \n Zara has just moved to Maine to live with her grandmother after the death of her step-father/father (already losing points). She's been a mess since his death and she also has this weird ability to remember phobias. She knows that she is strange it doesn't help either that she keeps seeing this guy following her around. But she feels slightly better when her grandmother sees him too. She doesn't really want to go to school the next day. But her grandmother makes her. \n At school, Zara meets some friendly people already. Ian, Nick - who she thinks is really cute - Issie, and her kind of sort of boyfriend Devyn. But there are also the mean girls too, like Meghan who for no apparent reason hates Zara on sight. But something strange is going on in this small town, and it all has to deal with the guy who has been following Zara around. Does she have it in her to unravel the mystery and face whatever it entails?"}

{"text": "This book just was not for me. It was slow paced, boring and bogged down with petty/silly stuff. I just couldn't bare it. It would have also helped if there was some twist or something on the Cinderella story. Instead it was like Cinderella with steampunk and a really slow story. \n If you are the right reader for this, you will love it. Let me just say, if by page 50 or so you are bored or tired. It won't get better."}
{"text": "Crosspost: TheReadingBelle.com \n What drew me to this book was the cover and the synopsis. I really wasn't expecting Faith and Moonlight to be so short! \n The writing style was not my favorite. Even though this book was less than a 100 pages, I found myself having a hard time to finish it. I also should have read the previous books, that was my fault. This book is supposed to be a prequel to the other books in the series. \n The story started immediately, and I thought the protagonists were okay. Initially, I thought they were much older, but they are fourteen years old. Roan and Kay had gone through a lot since the fire. I liked Kay a bit more than Roan, she was more developed. I did like their friendship and how both of them were willing to sacrifice their happiness. I can see Roan and Kay develop feelings for each other in the far future. Faith and Moonlight does not focus on romance, but rather friendship and hard work. \n Overall, the story didn't get really interesting near the ending! When I got to the end of the book, I felt a little cheated just because it ended once it was the story was starting to get somewhere good. The story itself felt incomplete. \n I have to wait for the sequel just to know what will happen next. And hopefully the sequel doesn't end like this one did. \n Final Rating:[?][?][?]"}

{"text": "Almost over. I don't think i can handle the suspense of wondering what is going to happen."}
{"text": "I enjoyed The Shadow Pavilion (fourth story in the series) even more than Snake Agent. Exciting and suspenseful with multiple story lines involving an assassin; the new emperor of heaven--and his mother; a Bollywood actress with a temper--and claws; the badger and Inspector Chen's demon partner, who've been kidnapped; Inari, Chen's wife; more demons; No Ro Shi, the demon hunter; and new characters to add spice to this boiling pot of danger, which covers a lot of territory!"}
{"text": "Another triumph, bathed in blood. Fewer covers have been as appropriate as this one, and even fewer tales less steeped in death, mayhem and destruction, but this still shines like the diamond in the chain around the neck of the King of the North."}
{"text": "I'm not entirely sure what to think of this book. It's a brilliant world populated by too many characters -- I had trouble keeping them straight. I assumed this was a problem because I read the first half in short bursts, but then I spent an entire afternoon reading the rest and still had difficulty remembering who was who among the male characters. It names drops frequently both fictional Victorian characters and historical figures from the period -- everyone from Bram Stoker to Sherlock Holmes (he, sadly, does not appear, as he has been interred in a concentration camp, but Mycroft does make a handful of appearances). \n It's an alternate history tale that follows up on the idea that Dracula won his fight with Van Helsing, and went on the conquer Britain, with the result that the city is now crawling with shape-shifting vampires. Someone is now dashing about murdering prostitutes, earning him the name Silver Knife by the tabloids. Later, that turns into \"Jack the Ripper.\" In that sense, it's a clever idea (we know the villain from early on and his motivations) but some plot threads don't make much sense and have no real follow-through (unless I skim-read over it, we never found out why the hopping Chinese vampire was so intent on killing the heroine). The characters are rather one-dimensional and I cared about none of them. \n It reads beautifully, but for me, the experience was lessened by the luridness of this world. The author doesn't shy away from crass descriptions of cruelty, gore, or sex. He also pads the narrative with more description and detail than I like, which makes it a tedious read. It's an interesting world but I doubt I'll read further books."}
{"text": "9/10th&up \n Third in the Body Finder series. \n Derting continues her series with another supernatural romantic thrilling adventure starring Violet Ambrose. I loved the suspense, the love triangle, the secrets and surprises. For some reason I thought this was going to be the last book in a trilogy, but according to the surprise at the ending (and the romantic questions left unanswered) there is still more to come. \n Should be a winner for teen readers."}
{"text": "Well, it's no Magic's Pawn, but none of them ever will be again (let us not dwell on the probability that this is because I will never be twelve again) and in fact it's not a book I'm particularly ashamed of being given in hardcover. It sounds like a new series is being launched with some promising setup -- tension between the Heralds, Bards, and Healers! Herald turning on Herald! Ominous strangers from outside the borders! A certain lack of the preaching to the choir which has been driving me mad in Lackey's other recent works!"}
{"text": "Sookie Stackhouse books are plain addictive. Once I start reading one of them, I don't want to put it down until the final page. They are funny and scary and violent and sexy and very compelling. The heroine, Sookie, is a telepath in love with a vampire. So, what could go wrong? Except everything. Sookie's path to true love is not a smooth one. She just keeps stumbling from one disaster to another. Her trials and tribulations are unending. I have never before encountered a young woman so constantly in danger of kidnapping, rape and/or murder. And she has not one, but two, powerful vampires in love with her. And a werewolf. And a shapeshifter. On the other hand, her love life has never looked better. Most humans think she is crazy. Apparently the ability to read minds doesn't go over well on a date. Needless to say, I have already told my local library to get the next book for me."}
{"text": "I think this is a book for people who read the previous books. I got about 30% into this book and find it so boring I can hardly follow what's happening.

{"text": "This is the story Pamela makes into a movie called Starsea in Grimwood's novel \"Replay\", in \"Replay\" you get a vague description of the plot and a more in-depth one of the effect the movie has, that's to say, a worldwide change in perspective for the viewers. The real story does not quite live up to what I had imagined but I liked it a lot, especially the second half, where events start succeeding one another at a crazy speed and I realised I cared what happened to the characters (human and dolphin)even though they weren't, to be honest, all that tridimensional. The descriptions of graphic violence creeped me out but I can't say they are out of place. Because of the role of imagery and images in it it's so very prominent it very likely would make a much better movie than novel, fan of words that I am, sometimes you do need a picture."}
{"text": "I am reviewing Borne by Jeff VanderMeer. Here are my thoughts: \n ^^ Rachel's a scavenger trying to survive in a destroyed world that is littered with biotech experiments the Company have discarded and nothing is ever what it seems. She meets Wick who makes his own way, by dealing with all sorts of things he finds, breaking them down and making the best use out of what he can. Then Rachel finds Borne, but instead of breaking him up and using him for parts, she keeps him. Not only does he start to talk, become a person and grow on her, he starts to grow - into something quite huge and alien. Yet despite his quirkiness Rachel and Borne become attached; like mother and child. What can become of such a relationship in a world where survival is everyone's priority? \n ^^ Borne. How to explain Borne? He waffles between childlike and adult states as he finds his way around Rachel's world. He can morph into objects and people, but without these disguises he forms a six-foot hybrid of a squid and a sea anemone with a ring of circling eyes. In short, he's a fascinating, shape-shifting character, and one Rachel takes it upon herself to teach the ways of the world. One he is clearly not used to living in. \n ^^ Then there's the giant grizzly God-Bear called Mord, the Magician, the poison rains, memory beetles, and the odd discarded biotech that could cause death or discomfort. \n ^^ I quite liked how this book is split into three parts, and each part/chapter has a sub title relating to the next part of the story. \n ^^ Underneath the surface of this post-apocalyptic tale of survival, there is something more. Something deeper. You'll see it as you read through. Maybe the author is writing of a world not so alien after all. If you read in between the lines, is our society so different? Do we teach our children what is best, only to have them go their own way as soon as they have a mind of their own? If you look closer, there are so many similarities to modern life as we know it today. It's a kind of charming, yet terrifying read all rolled into one. \n ^^ This is a great book for any fan of fantasy and science fiction set in a dystopian world, where technology and the supernatural intertwine. \n Overall: VanderMeer's dystopian world is a weird and wonderful mix creative strange characters, a fascinating mind and world-building skills. I've never read anything quite like it! \n Thank you to NetGalley for my ARC copy."}

Now it's time for The Dex-Files :-D I'm seriously excited! !"}
{"text": "Hunted is a haunting retelling of the Beauty and the Beast fairy tale. Yeva's father taught her hunting skills while she was still a child. As a young woman, she chafes against the restrictions of polite society. Circumstances cause her family to lose their wealth and return to their remote hunting lodge in the woods. Yeva's father disappears while tracking a mysterious beast and our heroine sets out to find him. She is too late for a rescue so the mission changes to avenge his death. The hunter becomes the hunted after Yeva is captured by her quarry and becomes a prisoner. The beast has his own mission for the Beauty and gets her cooperation by threatening the lives of her remaining family members. I loved this book and will be looking for other ones by Meagan Spooner. This is not Disney nor is it Grimm. Hunted is something different from either of the familiar versions in this captivating and original tale."}
{"text": "It was okay. I didn't love it and I didn't hate it. The overemphasis on the era has been said by many and is a valid point. I might continue with the series but probably won't be recommending this to people when there are better books out there to be read."}
{"text": "I really enjoyed this one...so I'm giving it 4.5 Stars. \n The double POVs were a bit difficult for me. I prefer books with only a single voice, but hearing inside both these girls' heads was not too terrible. If I had to choose, I would have wanted to stay with Lucy the entire way... \n The story was quick to start and didn't let up until the end. There wasn't much back story given, mostly just info dumps, but the story was engaging enough that I didn't mind. The plot, centered around \"born\" vampires, has been done. In some respects this plot reminded me of VA but I'm not saying this is a shoddy Xerox of that series. Harvey has made this her own by the use of interesting personalities as well as a great cast of supporting characters. \n Lucy was awesome. I loved her voice, but I think I am a bit biased. I tend to gravitate toward snarky, blunt characters. I enjoyed her relationship with Solange. Their loyal/loving friendship made for a great backbone for this story. Solange, eh....kinda bored me a little. I wished the author would have, I don't know, made her a bit more strong? Growing up with all those brothers, as well as a kick-ass mother, I just assumed her voice/personality would have been different. I guess she takes after Liam... \n The romance was nice, cute even. It wasn't overdone or completely cheesey. It was not the prevailing theme and I liked that. It was interwoven within the storyline which helped build the plot as well as compliment it. \n The dialogue was witty. The villains were not overdone. Pacing was pretty good. MCs as well as the supporting ones were written well, some of the brothers are pretty forgettable, but I guess its hard to define that many in only one book. Overall, this is a quick, easy read and I would recommend it to anyone who loves this genre."}

{"text": "This novel grabbed me and refused to let go. \n Not only was it a quick, gripping and easy read the plot was believable - the characters acted appropriately and it was often downright funny. I will never be able to go to the bathroom while camping again without cracking up. I laughed, I cried, and laughed some more. \n My absolute favorite thing was Jayne, the protagonist. She did not simply accept things. She did not make stupid mistakes just to further the plot, she resisted, she fought and she has a great smart sassy funny kick-butt attitude. I really enjoyed reading through her perspective. \n The cover is great, the editing inside the novel is very professional and well done. I had zero complaints in that regard. \n The plot was unique as well as well developed. I am not exactly sure what I was expecting when I first started this book, but what I discovered left me pleasantly surprised and delighted. \n I look forward to reading more in the series, and will be purchasing them soon. \n I have been trying to think of anything negative that I should include in the review, but really the only thing would be that it does end on a cliffhanger, but not an unreasonable one. The only unbelievable part of the novel was very early on, with Tony and a gun. It felt a bit to glossed over, otherwise, everything was spot on. \n If you like sassy heroines, fantastical suspense and enjoy a bit of magic, this book will not disappoint."}

It's in said goth club that he meets our seductive sociopathic hero Lau, and of course falls head over heels in lust. I'm still not sure why, other than the fact that Lau's pretty. Lau is not a nice guy, and he prostitutes himself on the Canada's mean streets for money. I'm not finding much to respect, here. \n And now I can't stop seeing Jesse as the bitter antagonist describes him: greasy dyed hair, pale skin, an infected piercing. NOT feeling the romance."}

Vinnie has problems of her own with her Mom (whom she doesn't want anything to do with) - with her Dad (whom is dead) and now a mate. \n Will these two unlikely people stay together?

{"text": "This book blew me away in how much the writing style got in the way of the story. Seriously if you are writing the kind of book that needs a map and glossary, both should be located in the front of the book. \n Anyway the actual story itself was attention grabbing enough once I stripped away all the human activities-like drinking and eating off of china-that didn't make any sense. i did really like that the mermaids had different types of bottom halfs going on. \n Mermaids were treated more like centaurs in this book with their customs and traditions either being borrowed from humans, or it being suggested that humans got their traditions from the merfolk. I liked the attempt at saying that mermaids can be found all over the world and that they tend to take after species from those waters. \n There was a glaring issue with that science wise. Certain species of fish can't survive outside of their respective climates. I would have expected this to be addressed in some way, like song-spells to help them survive or something. Since it is such a huge plot-point that they come together. \n All in all not my favorite book but I am invested in knowing what happens to the characters now, so there is that."}

You're basically dumped into this world that resembles our world, but isn't the one we know anymore because the aliens have won. They've infiltrated the humans and are walking around with our bodies. Melanie was one of the last until she went to go look for her cousin Sharon and ended up being found by the Seekers - their version of the police - and in a last ditch effort threw herself into an empty elevator shaft. But it didn't work. They were able to heal her and now the Wanderer is in her body. But Melanie is strong and won't disappear. Not that you really figure that information out right away. Like I said you're dumped into the middle of things and it's very strange to have two narrators that cohabited the same body."}

{"text": "I've to admit I wish the whole series were about Queen Coriane. Me goofball bought all the books (those covers were too pretty!!) beforehand and now I saw the actual series is about Mare Barrow. \n Anyhow, I enjoyed those prequels. As said, I enjoyed the tone, setting, and characters of the book. I thought Coriane is a pretty interesting character and her marriage to King Tiberias was short lived (in the book) but what I could read, how they met etc., I really enjoyed. \n I'm sort of dreading to find out who Cal's step-mother is *sighs* because as Tiberias promised her, he'll only love her now and forever. Bittersweet how their story ended :( \n Overall, I'm glad I picked this book up and will continue the series to see if Mare is my type of gal or not. \n ________________________ \n Read all my reviews (A-Z) on the blog \n Like the blog on Facebook \n Email subscription to my blog"}

{"text": "The much awaited romance of The First Dragon! \n Another of Katie Mac's Dragon books; this one about the very first dragon, the father of them all and like the others this one doesn't disappoint. Long time Katie fans had been waiting for the First Dragon's romance and I have to admit I was a little disappointed that this book would be \"only a novella\" but somehow Katie managed to pack it full even in this short form. \n I thoroughly enjoyed listening to the musings of the first dragon as he tried to assimilate into the modern world, running into a beautiful Siren and discovering that he missed the company of a female. I don't want to add to much more as this is a novella and it is to charming to post spoilers. \n This is a great addition to the Dragon Series and if you have enjoyed the others you will love this one."}

{"text": "3.5 stars. \n This was a good story, but was bogged down by by a lot of technical details about the PsyNet. The author has created an interesting world and introduced several characters that will star in future books. Although the main characters left me cold, their sexy dreams were very entertaining."}
{"text": "WARNING: DO NOT read the 2002 edition with the brown-haired boy on the cover. It has been badly edited and \"sanitised\" for children, to the point that many parts of the story no longer make sense. Find an older edition of the book, if you can. \n Bentley Ellicott is the stuff of legends. You wouldn't know it to look at him, though. To most of the people who know him, he appears to be a fairly ordinary eight-year-old boy growing up in small town New England. Perhaps a little more thoughtful than most, perhaps a little peculiar. But Bentley has a secret: he was born to be a hero. The same heart that belonged to Gilgamesh, King David, King Arthur, and hundreds more throughout history, beats in his breast and whispers to him about his destiny. One day, he will become a great warrior against evil, in a struggle which may cost him his life and all he holds dear. That doesn't bother Bentley, though. He knows that all the great heroes of legends were grownups. It will be years before he will be called upon to fulfill his destiny. Or so he thought. \n This has been one of my all-time favourite books since I was in high school. I've lost count of the number of times I've picked it up, read the first page, and been unable to put it down again. I've also lost count of the number of copies I have bought and given away to friends over the years. I love Bentley and his best friend Slally (I especially love Slally; she's such an awesomely fierce little girl). I love wise old Dumbledore-ish Dr. Kreistein. And I love the way the lives of the residents of Stonehaven interweave to tell a tale out of legend. This is a fantastic book."}

{"text": "Crosspost: thereadingbelle.com \n I really felt the book was a bit overrated, it wasn't necessarily bad nor my favorite. I kept seeing so much love for this book. I really tried to love it, but I felt it was okay. \n It's a fairy tale retelling of Beauty and the Beast. Tamlin was the hot fairy who can turn into a wolf That was my problem with the book. Sure Tamlin was cursed, but he was handsome, and not a beast. (Yi . Yi ;;) \n The book was a bit boring during the first half. It felt more like a Cinderella story because Feyre had to do everything for her family and her sisters were very ungrateful, especially Nesta. I really felt sorry for the protagonist because without her, her family would have died. I just hated how her family didn't appreciate Feyre risking her life in the woods. Anyways, she kills a wolf who happens to be a faerie and is forced to live with the fae due to the Treaty between faeries and humans. The action scenes were amazing. \n The first half of the book, I did not like and then, when I got to the second half, that's when everything became exciting. There was a reason why the Spring Court had masks on their face. There was a reason why Tamlin tried so hard to make Feyre fall in love with him. Feyre risked her life to save Tamlin and the Spring Court by going through three difficult trials and the ending didn't end in a cliffhanger. It ended on a happier note. \n I really hated Amarantha. What a villain. She seemed unstoppable too, and made life worse for Tamlin and Feyre. I loved that Feyre was ready to fight and prove her love was real. I really liked Tamlin and Lucien, they were great characters. I really like Tamlin and Feyre together, they had chemistry. Overall, those two are perfect together. There were some steamy scenes as well that made me blush. Tamlin did all he could to keep Feyre safe. I was satisfied with them, but I also feel that Rhysand and Feyre have chemistry as well. I didn't like Rhysand at first, near the end I loved him. He's sassy and manipulative, and overall awesome. I felt he was more of the beast than Tamlin. I can't wait to see what happens in the second book. Although, I would have preferred it being a stand alone, there is still much more the author can write about. Lastly, I wonder what kind of power Feyre now has since she is a faerie. (>bL< *) \n Would I recommend this book? It's hard to say. It was only entertaining near the ending. Would you continue reading the series? Yes. \n Final Rating: [?][?][?](3.5) .. .:*deg.. .:*deg.. .:*deg.. .:*deg"}

The opening hook is a good one, there are plenty of thrills, and the climax is suspenseful and the ending ensures that all loose ends are nicely tied together. \n While there are many elements that seem eerily familiar and reminiscent of such classics as Harry Potter, Coraline, Alice in Wonderland, the Wizard of Oz and Greek mythology, I still enjoyed this book, and appreciate the way Oliver set up her story to have an element of disbelief- did Liza really have an adventure? Or was her quest just a way of escaping from her lonely life, and the tension she sensed from the adults in her world. Was her escape \"real\", or just a coping mechanism? Or am I just reading too much into a children's book? \n Regardless, anyone who picks this up will find their time nicely spent."}

It then sat on my shelf for 4 months because I knew it was supposed to be really good so I was saving it for when I needed a really good book to read. \n I mostly do not read all parts of reviews before I read a book so that I don't get any spoilers or don't expect anything specific. Usually I just look at a book's rating (if the blog does it) or read their last paragraph (which usually sums up how they felt about it). \n WHICH MEANS (all of this build up for this, I know): I had NO IDEA the romance in this story was so intense. And that that was what the entire book was based on (yes yes, I knew that there was romance, but I underestimated the power of Maggie Stiefvater). \n This book kept me emotionally involved from beginning to end; not just to where I cared about the story, but I CARED ABOUT THE STORY. (In caps. That's the only way I can describe it.) \n Yes, the story was good, it was fun, it was intricate. It was well written. But the thing I really took away from Shiver was the powerful emotions I felt. And I'm going to stop trying to describe them. \n You love romance/emotions/relationships, read Shiver."}
{"text": "I read this over the last two evenings, and am still feeling a bit shaken. A book which deals with families, grief and loss in a brutally honest way, and makes you stand up and face your own monster, your own truth. \n The illustrations complete the book, I don't think it would have been nearly as powerful with the text alone. Trying to sleep after reading, I could almost see my own yew tree monster, just waiting outside my window... \n Besides dealing with the reality of illness and death, the story also highlights the terror of loneliness, of feeling unable to fit in, or communicate, which both children and adults must all feel at times. I cried. I would highly recommend."}
{"text": "Legacy, the first of a trilogy, is a beautifully written novel which is cleverly plotted out and well paced. The story follows the life of Princess Alera who is faced with the pressures of being the next heir to the throne. Alera, as future queen, struggles to come into terms with what her duty to her kingdom holds. \n I adored this novel, even though it wasn't suspenseful it was addictive , I couldn't bring myself to put it down. Overall the reason why I had enjoyed this book so much was because there was frankly nothing to dislike about it. The characters, plot and overall themes were well thought-out and the story was smooth and an easy read. \n Who doesn't like a story about a Princess, a kingdom and of course a forbidden romance? \n Even though this book consisted of elements that would make you think the story would be quite predictable , I found that it was in fact the opposite. I applaud Cayla Kluver (who wrote the book at the age of sixteen) for her amazing work on creating characters which couldn't help but win me over. The ending of the book was promising and provided great expectations for when I read the sequel."}

{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n I find myself wavering here. If I could give 2.5 stars, I think I would. \n The beginning and middle were good. It put me in mind of Harry Potter a little bit, how he had to deal with suspicion and continue his studies as best he can while learning a new sports game. Potter was more sociable than Mags, though. And then it went off the rails when tragedy struck. \n I didn't mind the tragedy, nor the ensuing fights. They actually brought tears to my eyes, honestly. But how is everything forgiven so easily in two pages or less? Bear ripped into Mags twice, once because of his own problems and frustrations, and never even says \"Sorry.\" Instead Mags is the one apologizing. I'm still confused as to why. And Mags yelled at Lena so she obviously deserves an apology. But Bear was a d**k. \n Also, when did Lena become such a chump? She's after daddy's approval again by the end of the book. Didn't the boys have this talk with her already? Did someone cast a magical Spell of Forgetting, is it something psychological, or is hope springing eternal yet again? \n Yes, I am going to read the sequel."}
{"text": "I heard Percy at the local Wordstock day, and I was drawn to read the book by the description of bringing the Lewis and Clark expedition into the future apocalypse. Actually I think the main link to history is the naming of characters. (I googled names of those on the expedition and yes they were on the original, but not necessarily similar. For example Clark is a female ranger, though she led the book's expedition; York is her half brother, though it is indicated he is dark.) I saw two parallels: Lewis kept a journal and the two got separated for a piece. Maybe someone who knows more about the historical trek would see more subtle parallels. \n The pacing was intense. There were always several subplots going, and moving back and forth was pretty well signaled--only occasionally confusing. The shifts created many cliff hangers. It was very hard to put down at bedtime. (And you can see I didn't put it down many times.) There were enough twists and turns, but not too many. \n The main characters were fairly rounded and developed. Some of the minor ones less so, having no dimension beyond their evilness. The setting was vividly described: hot, cold, mutations, past history; the ongoing fires in oil fields were quite convincing. There were interesting references to climate and country history as the group traveled through. \n If you like apocalyptic/adventure reading, you would like it."}

Jane has grown so much and the more knowledge she receives about her abilities and the other planes, the more confident she becomes in herself. \n Will the ghosts sent to her always be on her side? Will she always be able to find a way to release those lost souls, even if they don't want to move on?

{"text": "This is a wonderful book. Classic Salman Rushdie. He evokes fantastical worlds with in his lyrical writing style. While it may be categorised as a children's book, because of the 'fantasy' element in it, I think it is a great read for adults too. It draws a lot from classic Asian story telling. It is in fact a tribute to the lost art of Dastangoi storytelling. A must-read for everyone."}
{"text": "Every time I finish an Aplylynne Pike book I ask myself one question, \"Why?\". Why do I put myself through this, why do I read it? And I have finally come up with the answer, because this book is just so bad that it's good. \n So this latest installment of the Wings (series) has Tam going into high school with Laurel. So if you can't see what's coming you are either insanely blinded, reading this book as your first ever book or just seriously in denial. \n Some of my problems with book 1 and 2 are cured and solved. Mysterious black clad woman from the second book is sorta developed but not really. She's still a mystery. \n There is still the illusive references to Laurel and David making whoopie, and then you randomly toss Tam in the picture and it just turns into one big ball of hormones and badly developed romance. \n Without ruining too much of this book for people who want to read it, all I can say is predicable, predicable and well.. predictable. Every single part of this book was predicable. \n On the plus side, it was a quick read, gave me a good laugh and I'll be waiting for the fourth book."}
{"text": "See full review for Always a Witch at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n If I remember right from my review of the previous book, I liked the character of Tamsin because she was sarcastic and the 'black sheep' of the family. The same thing applies for this one. Despite discovering that she does in fact have a Talent - a really cool one when you think about it - she is still treated as an outcast. Because her power isn't as cool as I think it is. Some of her family thinks that it's unnatural and are avoiding her at all costs. Which is hard to do considering her sister is getting married and the whole family is in town and Rowena is bridezilla. So add in a stranger who time traveled from 1899 looking for information about the Greene family who can jump into other people's bodies and things are about to get interesting."}
{"text": "Enjoyable read! I liked that Connie is not a typical cold-hearted, sexy, perfect, genius, vampire hunter. She's like a real person with flaws and weaknesses and fears. \n I really enjoyed the style of writing. I'm not usually a big fan of first person perspective, but I feel the author used a great balance of dialogue, descriptive text, and the character's \"voice\" really shone through without being too colloquial. \n Vampire fiction is a tricky subject these days as it's becoming so common, but I feel like this book was unique enough to stand out.

The movie based on this book follows along so well with the book with just a few minor details changed around a bit and they're not even noticeable really. I enjoyed reading about Gilderoy Lockhart even though I really wouldn't like to meet him in person. He's really full of himself and thinks he knows everything there is to know about magic.... the actor in the movie portrayed Lockhart really well. You get to know more about Ron and his family. Ron's family seems to be the kind of family I would like to know and be friends with, unlike Harry's aunt, uncle, and cousin. I enjoyed every part of this book and I wouldn't mind reading this book over and over again. If you're like me and have just mainly watched the movies, then I highly suggest that you read the books as well."}
{"text": "4 Telekinesis Kicks Ass Stars! \n Source: Printed ARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Sullivan and Partners \n This is technically book two of this series but it could be read as a standalone. However, you will get more from the story reading it as a series. This book is based around the gruff, brooding Beau Deveraux, whom after his brother Caleb's experience he doesn't take anything to lightly and believes anything can happen. \n Arial (Ari) has come into this world loved but had to be hidden because of her special powers. Her parents would do ANYTHING to keep her safe. Because safety was always an issue, her dad let her know that if she ever needed help when he wasn't there to go right to Beau or Caleb Deveraux. \n The minute Beau meets Ari his shell starts to chip and he instantly wants to take care of her. And it doesn't take long for Beau to step up to the plate because the minute they try and leave his office all hell breaks loose. \n All Ari has ever known are her parents but she quickly has to depend on others. As Ari and Beau are trying to survive they also fall into each other and start to depend on each other quite quickly. \n However trying to survive isn't the only thing Ari has to deal with as she finally finds out more truths about herself and her past. \n Blood didn't make a family. \n Love did. \n Ari has a pure heart which makes her a bit of martyr when it comes to other but she does have a kick ass gift so you can't really blame her. \n Because it was her nature to put herself before others. To protect when she was the one in need of protection. If she died saving his life it would be for nothing because his life wasn't worth a damn thing without her in it. \n For Beau thinking he has everything under cover quickly gets blown away when Ari gets taken and now he has to do anything to get her back because without her he would be lost. For Beau he NEEDS to take care of her but he really doesn't have to because with her gift Ari can easily take care of herself and others. As Ari holds a little vengeance to her attacker and her parent's kidnappers she unleashes a fury like no other. \n Thankfully there is a HEA for her and her family where she can surround herself with love and others who have similar gifts that make her feel normal and safe.

{"text": "See full review for All Together Dead at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n Another Sookie Stackhouse novel, another life and death situation because of vampires. But to change the pace a little bit this novel's tragic events don't take place in Bon Temps. Oh, sure the first seventy-five pages have to deal with the small little town, but most of this book takes place at the conference for the vampire leaders that was hinted at in the last book. Sookie has been employed by the Queen of Louisiana to accompany her, not only to figure out if humans are lying but to also play witness to her trial for the King of Arkansas' death. \n Before we even get to the conference though, Sookie has some interesting things happen. Her brother Jason gets married to Crystal because - shocker here - she's pregnant again. Quinn shows up for a day to see Sookie and they finally, FINALLY have sex and just like the sexual tension from the last two books, it lives up to the hype. He also tells her that after this conference he's going to have a whole month off and he would like to spend it with her. And then that slimy girl that Bill was dating finally cracks. She thinks that this trip that Sookie and Bill are taking together is some kind of ploy from Sookie to get back together with him, and the Sookie gets very close to slapping the crap out of her. But thank goodness for Sam who intervenes and kicks the trash out. \n Anyway, at this conference a lot of stuff is going on. Not only do you have the trial for the Queen, but the King of Arkansas second - Jennifer - who brings the suit against the Queen is mysteriously killed. A bomb is found on the same floor that the Queen is staying on and what's going on with all this extra luggage and coffins being found? Well, as it turns out it's all connected. Not that Sookie really figures that out until it's almost too late."}

{"text": "Rating: 3.5 stars \n I liked this book but there are things that took away from it, in my opinion. It's a good book, but it had several issues. \n First off, I wasn't annoyed by Mal as many people were. He wanted Alina to reach her potential and did everything he could to aid her in her quest. He's a good guy. I mean, their relationship bored me ( God, did it bore me) but they loved each other so whatever. \n One of the issues for me was that this was a continent heavily plagued by war and that was such an important theme in this story but it was just brushed away. Being orphans was very central to who Alina and Mal and emphasis was placed on how many had died in these endless fruitless wars but in the end, not even a glimpse of how this issue would possibly be resolved was given. Instead, they just housed more orphans ( REALLY???) \n \"No land, no life. Just a uniform and a gun.\" \n Maybe I just expected more from Alina. I guess I wanted her to want to fix it, become queen maybe but she chose to distance herself from it all. I respect the fact that wanting to make the world a better place just is not on everyone's agenda, I do respect that, but Alina showed such fire and initiative numerous times, she went on and on about how she was a force to be reckoned with so you just kinda expect more from her. I wanted to see Daenerys shine through but she just fizzled out. \n She stated numerous times that she loved her power and she loved being stronger but in the end, she reverted back to who she was before any of this happened. It just saddened me. \n One of the biggest themes of the Darkling's campaign is the need to end the wars that have ravaged Ravka. He went about it all wrong, of course, but it would have a lot more interesting to see both Alina and him 'rule as equals' as he stated. To have Alina temper his ruthlessness, create a balance. Or really, just for her to rule alone. Set things right herself after killing the Darkling. \n On the plus side, the scenes were she visits the Darkling are so incredible and one the major highlights of this book. But seriousy, the ending the Darkling got was just right. In some ways, it was what he needed. \n I felt bored in some portions but overall, I was always curious to see what would happen. Plus, I really loved all the secondary characters ( Bahgra in particular) and the scenes with Nickolai were always a treat, as expected. \n It's a good book. I just get the feel of missed opportunities. Of greater story lines that could've been had but were neglected. Of the potential for this to have been a great book. It just.... saddened me."}
{"text": "My brain is still reeling from reading essentially from the moment I got this book last night until the moment I finished it. It exceeded ALL my expectations. Moreover, it builds on everything Rowling did in the previous books and completely elevates the entire series to the realm of, dare I say it, metaphysical. I don't care how nerdy it is; this book makes me want to be more courageous, more faithful, a better friend...I love it. I can't wait to read it again, and to read it to my kids some day."}

{"text": "Crispin is a disgraced warlock attempting rehabilitation. He had no idea when he was recruited, as a child, by a blood magician that he was doing anything illegal. It was only when his mentor and caretaker was found guilty of murder that Crispin's involvement became known. He's been offered several mentors to re-train him in acceptable use of magic--and has failed all attempts, his magic--graphimancy--simply doesn't work like other types. Using his forbidden bone pen (fashioned from one of his own finger bones!) Crispin can draw with his own blood and make magic happen. It's a bit harrowing, and highly frowned upon. \n 4.5 Stars \n Ned and Crispin met when Ned assisted in the capture of Crispin's murderous mentor. They have maintained a clandestine love over the past several months, despite Ned's aversion to magic. He is \"flit\" able to hear magic, and he also despises this ability. As Crispin takes on yet another mentor, Ned's getting embroiled in a magical plot--jar sellers, like his neighbor, are being killed in extraordinary ways. Ned can hear the use of magic, and Crispin breaks his oath to save Ned and his rag shop for certain destruction. As the story unfolds Ned and Crispin learn that a great danger is being unleashed, and it's up to them to save London... \n It's a fantastic mystery, and a sweet romance. This book is the first in a spin-off series from the Charm of Magpies, and fully enjoyable on its own--though I will admit to rushing back and buying up the Charm of Magpie books.

{"text": "See full review for Squire at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n You know as I was reading this book, I tried to remember who Alanna did her squire years with and I seriously can't remember. I think that shows you how quickly Pierce glossed over some of Alanna's time as a knight in training. I remember her page years, but the squire years are a blur. Either that or they weren't all that interesting compared to Keladry's. I have to admit I was really happy that Kel agreed so quickly to being Raoul's squire. He had already taken an interest in her because of her work with a lance and he really admired how quick she was when they hunted those spidrens during her first year as a page. To me it seemed like the perfect fit."}

{"text": "The first 2 books in the series were entertaining. But this novel had two severe drawbacks. The first being the fact the story is told in part thru Jolie's diary entries. The second being the long, drawn out flashbacks. The majority of the book seemed to be a review of events from the first 2 books in the series. It was a slow, boring read. If I had not become attached to the characters in the first two novels, I would have given up and moved on to a more interesting read."}

{"text": "When I first started this book I was immediately worried. The narration was hard to sink into and I felt having it told in first person/present tense was often very jarring. It annoyed me and I was having a really hard time enjoying it. It felt like the story wasn't flowing and I expected it wouldn't be long before I gave up on it out of irritation. \n But I couldn't. I tried and I couldn't. Despite having a hard time getting into the writing, the story itself kept me glued. I absolutely positively adored the story. There were times that I thought it was forced and fake and that the main characters were really stupid and this entire thing could have resolved itself by about halfway through, but all in all, it kept me captivated despite frequent annoyance. \n I couldn't turn away from it and ended up staying awake till nearly 2 am to finish reading it. I had never heard of the fairy tale and didn't even realize it was based on anything other than the author's imagination. \n I was also pleased with the level of copy editing, no typos or missing words jumped out at me."}

{"text": "See full review for Six of Crows at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n In Ketterdam things are never easy, you're either trying to hard to stay alive or you're in a gang and are still trying to stay alive. When Six of Crows begins you're automatically dropped into a meeting between Kaz - a member of the Dregs - and a member of the Black Tips. Things aren't going well with this meeting and there are people who end up dead and traitors are named. But somehow, despite the odds, Kaz and his crew walk out of the scuffle mostly unscathed. That's when things get interesting one of the merchants approaches Kaz to do a job for him. A new drug that can heighten the abilities of the Grisha has hit the market and the Fjerds have captured its maker and are keeping him prisoner. The merchant - Van Eck - wants Kaz and a crew to go into the Ice Court and rescue him. Or else the economies as they know it will go sideways. \n It's an impossible task and Kaz sees no profit in it for him. Why would he care if the economy goes sideways? So Van Eck sweetens the pot. He offers thirty million krug if Kaz and his crew succeed in delivering this drug's creator to him. Not one to pass on such an exuberant amount of money he accepts. But before he can get in to an impenetrable fortress he's going to need a crew. He already has his Wraith - Inej - who is like a shadow and gets him out of sticky situations. He has his guns - Jesper - who is sharp at shooting but not so sharp at the gambling tables. And he even has a mechanic of sorts - Van Eck's son Wylan - who will do anything to prove himself worthy. Now all he needs a Grisha and someone who knows the Ice Court well. And he has just the two people in mind. Too bad neither of them can stand each other... \n So I have to admit that I absolutely adored this book. Leigh Bardugo is really awesome at what she does and the world in which she has created - which is really an extension of the Grisha universe - is just so detailed. It's amazing."}

Logan believed he had met his mate as a child and she died at the age of 10 meaning he would never have a mate. \n Charlie Stone was overworked and underpaid at the nursing home and now the police was closing it down and she has no place to go. When Logan and Charlie meet he doesn't understand this feeling for her -- she can't be his mate, can she? \n Another fantastic read by the amazing Kathi S Barton - would definitely recommend to everyone as a must read."}
{"text": "THE FAERY SWAP features two young(ish) boys--Finn, a human, and Zaneyr, a faery--who trade souls on the summer solstice in Amesbury, England--a stone's throw from, you guessed it, Stone Henge. \n Finn's whole life is devoted to keeping his sister, Erin, safe and out of foster care. See, they aren't orphans but their mom died a few years ago and their dad, a mathematics professor, is parentally MIA. On the way to school one morning, Finn is tricked into helping a strange boy with the smallest of tasks--picking up a dropped coin--and plummets into a realm of magic and fantasy the likes he never could have imagined. \n Zaneyr is determined to thwart his father, King Dageyr, from sealing the Rift--the magical space erected between the human and faery world 4000 years ago. In this breach of space-time, Zaneyr's mother was lost, locked into the mortal human world, while those in the faery Otherworld lived on, never aging. Each summer solstice, emissaries of the faery world are sent to Earth to learn of any advancements in math or science that might lead humans to Otherworld. Due to the time distortions of the Rift, a year in Otherworld equals a century of Earth years, so the advancements move quickly, compared to Otherworld time. \n Knowing that sealing the Rift will lead to many mortal lives lost, Zaneyr risks shifting with Finn--even if it means sending Finn's soul to Otherworld forever. One life must be worth more than the thousands that will be lost if King Dageyr's plan is complete, right? \n Of course, Finn is unwilling to go without a fight. He is assisted in his effort to return to the human realm by a rock sprite named Pyx and Zaneyr's BFF Liranna, a tough faery who harbors a crush on the impetuous prince. They have less than a day to reverse the swap--by sunset on the solstice the realms will be too far apart for souls to return to their previous realms--so it's handy that Finn develops some magical skills while trudging through the Otherworld. \n Just when Zaneyr is getting settled in Finn's life, the unimaginable happens--he meets a fellow faery, one who is desperate to return to Otherworld. And, of course, Finn manages to weave a bit of magic that interfere with Zaneyr's changeling plan. \n In the end, it is guidance from Finn's genius father that stops the realms from merging. \n This book is a real treat. Complete, interesting plot arcs call into question some very serious moral issues in a subtle way. For example, is it okay to sacrifice some to save many? And, what is the value of life? Most compelling for me was: is it fair to risk the happiness of everyone to fix an act long regretted? \n Most importantly, it is the teen characters who save the day--thwarting the mis-guided plots of King Dageyr to correct past mistakes. The HEA occurs two-fold, with both Zaneyr and Finn having a better place in their realms when the sun finally sets. It's written with boys in mind--but I believe girls and fantasy lovers of both sexes will enjoy this wholesome tale."}

When I first read these books years ago, Protector of the Small was actually my second favorite series by Pierce after the Song of the Lioness Quartet. And mostly because they follow the same lines with a few minor differences. Like for instance, Kel starts her training to be a knight with no secrets about her sex. And that's actually what was so interesting about this series. You get to see Kel's struggles as she tries to compete with the boys who don't want her there. Now, I kind of understand why Alanna kept her gender a secret during her training. And to think this is with Alanna as an accomplished knight in the world!"}

{"text": "I signed up for OwlCrate because the theme for the May 2016 box was Steampunk, which I love, and this is the book that was included. I would never have picked this one up on my own. I have never had a lot of affection for the story Peter Pan, so I was a little disappointed when I read the synopsis as and discovered this is a retelling of the classic. I was a little reluctant to start reading it but I took it with me on vacation and I was actually pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. \n I thought he steampunk/post-apocalyptic mash-up the author created with the world-building was quite successful. I found it easy to imagine the world described and enjoyed that aspect very much. I found myself liking the characters more than I expected, with the exception of Pete, who was a shadow (pun intended) of the typical dystopian YA male love-interest for the heroine. \n My biggest gripe would be how references to the original are often clumsily forced into the narrative. An example would be the villain's original, ridiculous long, awkward name becoming an acronym and then finally the nickname, Hook. \n The ending is satisfying too - not a cliffhanger and this book can stand on it's own. I was wondering partway through if this was going to go the way of the YA trilogy, but was very thankful for a clear and satisfying ending to this book. \n Even without the Peter Pan references shoe-horned into much of the story, I think this would still be a decent YA novel."}

I just couldn't get into this book. \n I was worried that it would be Twilight-esque, but it wasn't. It wasn't a horrible book, I just really didn't enjoy it. \n I tried, I really did, but by 3/4 the way through I couldn't do it, I couldn't force myself to love something that was so undeserving. \n Lets start of with the warped romance in this book. I get it, you want the weird goth girl (let me just pause for a second... goth... smh) is in love with a dead guy. \n Okay, dead guy, zombie, whatever. Let's just think about this... I know these are teenagers and they're in high school, and they're so innocent and pure and yada yada yada. And what typically happens the first time little teeny boppers get sexual? \n But this kid is dead. DEAD. Would things even function down there? \n Nope, let's not think about it. \n Can I just start off mentioning that Phoebe (the main character; don't think I ever mentioned that) goes from knowing who this kid was and being in the same english class, to full blown, head over heels, love at first sight bullshit. Where did this come from? Did her feelings wait until the book began to show up? I don't... I just don't. \n OK, for serious though, this book dragged on. Nothing really happened until the very end. Even the beginning was slow as shit, so I should have known before I started. \n I don't HATE this book. I just hated it... for me, you know?

I've never been hooked on a series longer than a trilogy; so you see, A2A is book 8 in the Experiment in Terror series (yep you've read correct - THE 8th BOOK!!) and I'm still head over heels for this series. \n If you thought Dead Sky Morning, On Demon Wings or Into the Hollow was creepy, ha then just wait until you read Ashes to Ashes!! I was reading it with all the lights on because I was about to pee my pants -and I'm not a wuss. But let me tell you what you can expect when reading A2A \n Welcome to Sea Crest Sanatorium \n A Sanatorium were thousands of young kids lost their life due to TB; were thousands of lost souls were haunting the crap out of Dex, Perry, Rebecca ... and me! \n Are you ready??? Ready for \"the children of the damned? Toddlers from hell? Well you better be ready 'cause for certain they are ready for YOU! \n \"I felt the darkness sitting on either side of us, the coldness of the tunnel seeping into my clothes.\"..... I didn't know what was worse-the void in front of us or the black emptiness behind us.\" \n Yeah ladies, that was the moment I was starting to feel CREEPED THE F*** OUT!! Oh but if you know Karina, you know she's going into nice detail; details that make your skin crawl, your hair stand up, and giving you enough material to have the best nightmares ever. She spooked the be-jesuses out of me because I never knew what's coming next!! I hope you're ready for a creepy but amazing read; it's definitely my fave creepy EIT book in the series. \n Now to Dex and Perry. \n Two months have passed and the two of them are living together in Seattle and are just too sweet to look at -both two love sick puppies. In A2A, which is written in Perry's pov, I saw that she had grown to a mature woman. Yes, she still has her insecurities but she has worked hard on herself. Also, Dex doesn't give her any reason to feel less than what she is. He's charming, still cocky, and expresses his love to Perry in such a way I was goner. I mean, seriously, can he get any better (and hotter *cough*)?? I don't think so... \n \"This is real. ... This is nothing but real. You and me. Us. You know that, don't you? ... I'm here. I'm staying here, by your side. This is more than just two people shacking up together. This is so much more. ~Dex \n Yep, me too was a love sick puppy after reading this. I mean, come on, not a single woman wouldn't have melted by his words, especially if you and him went through so many crazy things like Perry did. Those two are really meant for each other; I could feel it in A2A so much. \n But also Perry gave Dex the security he needed. Knowing she is not going anywhere, at least not without him. \n \"You...make me feel sane in this crazy world. You give me hope. You give me life. When I'm with you...I can't even believe I'm with you. It's like that every morning. Like I'm dreaming, but I'm not.\" ~Perry \n Sigh... yes those two deserve each other and way more. Both have had such a tough life (and still kinda do, if considering seeing ghosts on a daily basis, never escaping this craziness) that I'm just thrilled for them. \n Karina manages, again, to create a great balance between romance and paranormal. So no matter what your preference is, you won't be disappointed-she excels to cover both by hooking you page after page. I can't even imagine that her EIT series will come to an end because her books, stories, and characters are something I don't want to miss. \n \"This is real, baby. This is us. Now, always, us.\" \n ARC kindly provided by the author in exchange for honest review"}

{"text": "Crown of Midnight is a fantastic five star follow up to Throne of glass. (Source: I received an ARC from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.) \n What I liked: \n I found a lot of things to like about Crown of Midnight. I think I highlighted nearly half the book, noting down things I loved or writing that struck me as awesome. \n One of the first themes I really enjoyed was seeing how Celaena had to withstand the burden of hiding the fact that she isn't actually killing her targets and she had to bear the burden of her friends looking disgusted with her, thinking she was killing them. She accepted their judgement and criticism, to protect them while risking her neck to protect the innocent. \n I also love the developments between her and Chaol. In Throne of Glass there was a strong hint of romance to come, but in Crown of Midnight we truly get to see how much they have come to mean to each other. He's her safety. Her person. And he is learning to trust her. My favorite part was about 45% in, when we see just how much she has changed him and his priorities. I think I'd want Chaol for myself if his girlfriend wasn't a deadly assassin who is as lethal is she is beautiful. \n The plot was definitely good. It moved quickly and the foreshadowing especially was expertly done. There were several times where I had an idea of what was coming, but I could never be sure. Crown of Midnight overall didn't follow a predictable or boring pattern, I was enthralled, frantically reading to see what would happen next. \n Crown of Midnight is the type of book I will reread over and over again, because every moment spent reading it was a pleasure. \n What I didn't like: \n There really wasn't anything about the book I didn't like, honestly. I loved it that much. The only thing I have to complain about is the fact that now I have to wait for book 3. There were some major revelations, especially toward the end, and I'm definitely left wanting more. \n My recommendation: \n If you haven't read Throne of Glass yet, drop everything and read it, now. That way you can move on to Crown of Midnight because it is one of the new pillars of YA Fantasy, truly a must read. I \n This review also appears at http://kellywalker.net/crown-of-midni..."}
{"text": "4 stars \n This is a remarkable story about survival in the greatest sense of the word. It's one thing to be stranded on an island on Earth. It's completely different when you're stranded on a desert planet such as Mars. \n Mark Watney was left behind on Mars after a freak dust storm blew a hole in his suit. With no choice, his crew members aboard Hermes had to leave or all of them would die. Now all alone, Mark must find ways to somehow, get a message to Earth that he is still alive. But in order to do that, he MUST REMAIN ALIVE. ON MARS! \n How do you do that on a planet that is all dry land. No water, no growth of any living thing to make it livable. That's where Mark Watney's ingenuity, perseverance, and pure will power to do all that he can to survive come in. From getting water, to rationing food, and hey, even growing some food! Mark Watney is like the MacGyver of space. \n Told mainly from first person POV through logs, it recounts everything that happened. The majority of the book (80-85% of it) is told from Mark's POV so people who have a hard time with reading about just one person might find it tedious. I find Mark's personality to be very likable, especially his sarcasm, there's a certain charm to his thoughts. The events that occurred totally sucked me in, I found myself rooting for Mark and all the people back home working together to try and rescue him. That's another thing I enjoyed about this book. There's no villain who's sabotaging anyone's plans to rescue him (unless you count Mars itself, but that's the way nature goes, it's unpredictable). \n There's lots of laugh out loud moments, as well as, holy-shit-what-just-happened moments, to ones of triumph even over the little things. There's some science tech speak, but it didn't deter me from understanding what's going on or get the gist of it if it got too complicated. I just try not to think too hard on the math. There's a lot of it! \n I don't read a lot of sci-fi. But for some reason, I keep going back to this book, reading the synopsis again and again one week to another, and finally decided to just pick it up and read it. I'm glad I did. It was entertaining while leaving me on the edge of my seat. If this ever gets made into a movie, I would definitely be in line to see it."}

{"text": "\"Between The Devil And The Deep Blue Sea\" written by author J. L. Murray is the first in a series based on the fictional character of Niki Slobodian. J. L. Murray is a full-time writer with additional series credits to her resume such as the \"After The Fire\" series and Jenny Undead. The Niki Slobodian Series consists of five novels at this time and I have only read the first book so please take this into account with this review. \n In the book \"Between The Devil And The Deep Blue Sea\" we find our main character Niki Slobodian out of work, struggling to pay her bills and taking care of her god mother \"Sofi\" who is in the hospital with cancer and finding herself on \"The Registry\" for the last year with no hope of getting off and not allowing her to work because she is an \"abnormal.\" She somehow finds a bar called the \"Deep Blue Sea\" and walks in only to be approached by a gentleman named \"Sam\" who seemed to know everything about her, makes her a job offer and a large payment for her services. Niki of course takes the offer out of necessity and ends up on some unknown super secret police squad that deals with supernatural threats. Niki sets out to solve this case and get her life back on track hopefully for good. Partnered with a wizard named \"Gage\" that doesn't really understand how he knows what to do, she has to deal with a police chief that wants her head, a mayor that mysteriously keeps popping up in all the wrong places, a former boyfriend and police offer assigned to help her and having to face her estranged father who is in prison as being the first abnormal ever convicted. \n This book was a bit of a cliche' for me. A down on their luck character facing insurmountable odds. A mysterious character (Sam) who just happens to be super powerful and influential that can do what no one else can. A dark brooding partner we never really learn that much about. A powerful father who abandoned his daughter and Niki can't stand only to find out the truth later and so on and so on. There wasn't much here that wasn't completely predictable and absolutely zero twists and turns in this book. \n A few of the major issues for me was the complete lack of any ability to say anything other than \"I said,\" \"she said,\" or \"he said\" to end a characters statement. Not one \"... remarked\" or \"... agreed' or anything other than \"...said.\" That got to be very annoying and probably my biggest gripe in the book. The use of salt in this book was another huge cliche' right out of any \"Dresden Files\" book or \"Supernatural\" episode. While it wasn't a major issue, it just didn't seem very creative to me and was a very easy fall back. The ease of which the major big bad was finished off especially since he was invulnerable or un-killable. To be offed that easy by two complete novices with something as routine and wrote as the weapon was a very weak ending. I can't imagine in all the years of the human race the people fighting the supernatural, not one \"experienced\" person tried this on a major creature to figure it out. \n The book is very short and shallow as far as any real depth of character. There isn't a whole lot of development in it. Niki herself only reflects on herself or doubts for about one paragraph, the rest of the time she is the typical strong female lead character who is quick-witted, smart, sarcastic and bad ass that we have all become way to used to. \n J.L. Murray gives us a book that is more of an action movie like the Transformers except nowhere near as long. There is plenty of action. It moves at a good pace actually. The story in spite of my criticism doesn't ever seem out of line or not believable, it's just not different enough to really shake it's self from all the other paranormal action adventures out there. If this book were longer, with better character development, a bit more editing and a hair more creativity, I would have really liked it. That being said, it is still better than many I have tried to read lately. \n The author has talent and I am sure gets better as the series goes on. The book was good enough for me to want to read the next in line to see if the character develops any and find out if \"Sam\" is who I think he is. It's a decent effort and I can see a lot of potential for this author in the future. \n I am giving \"Between The Devil And The Blue See\" 3 out of 5 stars because the book was action packed enough to keep my interest. There weren't any boring parts or things that got lost or muddy in it. A little lacking on development and a lack of constructive editing as well as the short length are all that held this back. \n Note: A review copy of this book was not provided to me. \n The original review was posted here: http://clubfantasci.com/devil-deep-bl... \n Club Fantasci on Facebook: www.facebook.clubfantasci \n Club Fantasci on Twitter: www.twitter.com/clubfantasci \n Club Fantasci on Google+: Club Fantasci"}
{"text": "I didn't think this was a five star read because, well, we've been there, done that already. But, I do think that this is a must-read for anyone who has ever been a Twilight fan. There's a different \"what if...\" ending that I thought was interesting."}
{"text": "I'm not sure I'm going to be able to write a coherent review because holy shit this was one of the best books I've ever read. That ending broke me into a million pieces. I am shattered. I'm so thankful for those last two chapters because seriously if it ended how I thought it was going to end I would have been devastated beyond repair. That little bit at the end was enough to revive me but holy crap how am I going to wait for that last book? \n I'm just so so beyond grateful that I decided to give this book a try because I really was not a fan of ACOTAR, but this is now one of my favorite books of all time. It was beautiful written from start to finish and the characters were 1000000x better and I love everything that it represents."}
{"text": "Imagine everyone woke up one day to discover that magic was very much real again. As with so much in our modern life, the first reaction of the government would be to regulate it, to determine what the best uses of that magic was for the welfare of the nation - and what magics would be considered safe, and what magics would be prohibited. \n Welcome to the world of Shadow Ops: Control Point. Oscar Britton is your average enlisted grunt, bagging and tagging people that have manifested prohibited, or \"Probe\" talents, keeping America safe from one latent to probe at a time. What happens when this good guy suddenly finds himself marked a probe as his latent magic power manifests itself unexpectedly in a discipline that is forbidden (though outside his control)? \n He runs. \n As a concept, I think Cole has a good formula here. Magic meets military fantasy in a contemporary landscape? What's not to love in this comic book like milieu that is so reminiscent of Marvel and DC copyrights? \n The proof is in the pudding, as they say, and its in the execution that we find the lumps. The world building is as solid as needed - why magic suddenly exists is as much of a mystery to the characters as to us, and that's fine. The fact that Cole chose to set this in our modern world relieves the burden of painting an extremely rich picture to convince us with. We already know the setting, which leaves us with only the unknowns to deal with - the characters and the magic. With the world so easily established, its really in the strength of the characters and the magic they wield that we rely on to entertain us. \n For the magic, its rather simple and easy to grasp. You either come up with magic at some point in your life, or you don't. If you do, its in one of a few defined talents, most of which seem to be centered around control of the Greek elementals - water, fire, air, earth, and spirit (life, death, etc.). The prohibited magics are a little less well defined, but at least we don't have mixed talents (that we know of?). There doesn't seem to be any penalty to using the magic (weakness, inflammation, etc.), but it also isn't easily or quickly mastered. Simple and sweet and easy to follow once you understand the terminology that Cole bandies around. \n But the characters, like with any summer eye candy, is where I got hung up with in this novel. Even in the context of the story, Oscar's waffling at whether he's a team player or being beaten down was annoyingly inconsistent. Either track would have been fine, but I needed something to rally behind, and I didn't get that from Oscar. I found many of the other characters in the book equally baffling, leaving me wanting. This is probably just hindsight, but it seemed that there were chapters during the span of which Oscar would change his mind on whether he was committed to the cause, to and fro, multiple times. \n So, great concept, and perfect if you have an afternoon or two to kill and want a little magic versus assault chopper action. Myke's a really nice guy, so I have high hopes that the sequel will cast off the training wheels that were so evident in this first novel."}
{"text": "Review originally posted on journeyintotheshelves.tumblr.com \n **I received an eARC of this book courtesy of NetGalley and Lerner Publishing Group. This has had no bearing on this review. \n The Anatomy of Curiosity is a compilation of three short stories written by Maggie Stiefvater, Tessa Gratton, and Brenna Yovanoff. that really delves into the creation of each of the stories, and what goes into character development, world building, and the creation and follow-through of an idea. \n This book is fantastic for aspiring writers. It took me a while for me to read this because I didn't read it as just short stories - though you can, and each story has it's own merits - but rather I focused on their writing processes and the little notes and additions that each author added to their stories. \n The book starts off with Maggie Stiefvater's short story, \"Ladylike\", and her discussion on character development: she discusses how to introduce characters, how to develop and execute a character arc. Stiefvater gives great advice on how to create characters without blatantly telling the reader what he/she looks like; but rather how to get the feel of a character across to the reader, not just the physicality of them, all the while illustrating her technique in her story. \n The story itself was gripping. \"Ladylike\" is a tale about a shy, young girl, Petra, who is asked to read poetry to an elderly woman, Geraldine. Normally, Petra is unsure of herself and is always blushing at the most inopportune times, however when she recites poetry, she is in command of herself and confident. Geraldine helps bring confident Petra out all the time, but Geraldine has a secret of her own that could ruin their growing friendship. Stiefvater's characters leapt off the page and were truly the focus of this story. Honestly, I wouldn't mind reading an entire novel-length story about them. \n Tessa Gratton's story, \"Desert Canticle\", is all about world building. The story that went along with Gratton's lesson was incredibly detailed for such a short story. She explains and shows how world building can be woven into the plot and plot structure and how the world can imitate character and how character and plot can imitate the world. It was truly masterfully portrayed in this story. \n As a short story \"Desert Canticle\" was the one I liked the least. It is set in a female dominated society at the end of a desert war. The main characters are a Pacer, a person who is sent into former war zones to disarm magical bombs that bloom like flowers, and a Mage. While in the desert, the two form an unusual relationship that may be explosive on its own. It was beautifully written and well imagined, but the characters lacked a bit of development. However, the plot was engaging and had a nice twist that kept me invested. \n The last story, \"Variations on Drowning\", by Brenna Yovanoff is actually a compilation of various stories that stemmed off the idea of drowning that Yovanoff was fixated on for years. This part of the novel illustrates the progression from a simple idea to a beautifully written story about love and hope. Reading Yovanoff's process was really helpful because it shows how such a small and simple idea can be turned into something so much bigger, even if it does take a couple of tries. \n Overall, The Anatomy of Curiosity is a novel for that every aspiring writer should read. Though it can be read as simply short stories, those willing to learn from these seasoned authors would get the most out of the reading experience."}
{"text": "It's a fun, quick read, reminiscent of Tom Robbins (which I think is a common comparison made), though the dialogue is a little stiff and a bit predictable.

There is so much I want to discuss! First of all, this book is very political and complex. The book starts off several years after the Herran War. The Valorians were the winners of the war and forced the Herrani into slavery. \n Kestrel Trajan, what a character. She isn't your typical fighter, she's a strategist. She is cunning, smart, manipulative, and caring. She is the General's daughter and is constantly pressured into joining the military for her skills. Her father sees how much good she can bring to the empire if she joins. One of my favorite scenes, had to be when Kestrel won her duel against Irex when she blackmailed him, even though he was far more superior when it came to fighting. Kestrel doesn't want to be in the military, she wants her own independence. She is far more compassionate towards the slaves compared to any other Valorians. \n Arin, is a slave and spy. He is just as intelligent as Kestrel. He works under Cheat, the leader of the Herran Revolution. He and Kestrel have a complicated relationship. They think they know what is best for each other. It did feel that both of them kept playing a game to get the upper hand in their relationship. What I really appreciate about this story is that both protagonists don't instantly fall in love with each other. Their love slowly grows and I love the theme of forbidden love so much. I loved how much he tried protecting Kestrel. He protected her from taking the poison, he protected her from Cheat's advances, and he protected her from becoming a slave. Secondly, I loved the two alternating pov. (6ggeyrroxggey )6yh \n Praise the Lord! No love triangles! Sorry Ronan! Kestrel and Arin are perfect for each other. Ronan tries really hard to gain her affections, but she always ignores him and falls for Arin instead. 1| -) - |7 \n I did not like Cheat at all. He was corrupt and creepy. I, for one, am glad that he is dead. Man, he was definitely my least like character next to Irex. \n Kestrel and Arin have conflicting ideals, and they have to overcome their issues. Arin wants his people to become a nation, while Kestrel doesn't want any more deaths for both sides. While reading, I felt sad for the people who suffered on both sides. I was rooting for the rebels to take back their lands. I was not that ending of the book! It was so good!!! I was shocked that the she was forced into a loveless marriage, just so the Arin and his people would have their independence, but at a price. I am really excited to see what's in store for the second book cause I am hooked!! +(*o*)+"}
{"text": "Can you imagine this girl waking up in a dark alley naked? \n She's in amazing shape, has been arrested for indecent exposure almost a dozen times, and has the biggest roundest . . . eyes you have ever seen. And like most YA characters I've read about lately, she is strong and fast and has the ability to change into something not-quite-human. But unlike these same characters, she doesn't magically keep her clothes on like some G rated, ultra-cleaned up, Disney version of a werewolf/pixie/shapeshifter. This was, in fact, what kept me reading at the beginning when Maggie Mae's story read so much like teen book deja vu. \n Characters with no parents . . . check. \n Vulnerable protagonist with mysterious ability . . .check. \n Good looking rich dark-eyed boy (Bridger) with a secret . . . check. \n Who likes her for no apparent reason . . . check. \n Even when she treats him like crap at the same time she ogles and ogles and ogles him . . . check, check, check. \n In fairness, the girl has abandonment issues. Huge, monstrous abandonment issues. And after she is viciously targeted by bullies in chapter eleven, she gets some pretty bad advice from her foster mother, Mrs. Carpenter, who tells Maggie that if she changes schools she'll be letting the bullies win. \n I can just see how that kind of logic would pan out if we extended it to its natural conclusion. The awkward fourteen-year-old girl I used to be would stay in class for an entire year with the boy who sexually harassed and bullied her rather than change classes. \n Okay, so maybe that actually happened, but things only got worse, not better. And I came to see that the reason I stayed had less to do with being strong and more to do with pride. It wasn't worth it. \n I digress. \n The author makes up for this misguided philosophy when she turns the tables on the reader later, showing how Bridger's true nature is hidden under Maggie Mae's need to project her prejudices and insecurities onto him. \n So you think Bridger's a one-dimensional stuck-up rich kid, do you? A cardboard character derived of nothing but cliches? Well, humph. Is it possible that you are the stuck-up cliche, but have projected your personality onto him? \n My whole mindset changed. \n Bethany did something with the voice of Maggie Mae that Stephenie Meyer couldn't do with Bella's voice in four massive volumes. She put Maggie through a paradigm shift in her thinking and took me with her. It was fabulous. Just fabulous. And I'm not even going to talk about the gripping, edge of your seat feeling I had through most of this book, or the very cool Navajo Skin Walker folklore, or the unbelievable twist at the end that made my stomach plummet. This isn't your typical young adult shapeshifter book. It makes you think. It sits with you. And it's aptly named because it truly shifted my perspective."}

She thought she was going insane. She was almost killed a few times. She fell in love for the first time. She found out that her father wasn't really her father and that there are fallen angels and Nephilim walking around in the real world. So what could possibly happen to top all of that? Well... \n It's been three months since the end of Crescendo and Nora wakes up in the cemetery having no idea how she got there or what day it is. When the groundskeeper finds her, he tells her her worst fear. It's not April like she thought, but actually September. She's been missing for three months and she has no memory of the last five.

A few weeks later, she is testing to see if she still has his essence by putting her hand into a lit fireplace. She doesn't feel a thing, meaning that she's still got part of Vlad's essence around her, which is a good thing considering the vampire himself has been pretty MIA lately. In fact, things between the two of them haven't been all that great. Leila knows that she loves him, but he's already told her that she shouldn't and he can't offer her much more than being his lover. \n But it looks like things are all about to change when Vlad holds a dinner, inviting most of his vampire line, and Leila's father and sister. After the dinner, he presents her with a ring box. She thinks it's an engagement ring. It's not. Instead it's Vlad's family crest, he's offering her a position in his line. Humiliated Leila leaves the room, but that doesn't stop Vlad from following her. What follows is an intense conversation where she finally realizes that he was right, he's never going to offer her anything more than being his lover, and she decides that it's time for her to leave.

They've faced a lot of trouble over the last few years between a crazy vampire, a rebel raising ghoul, and the tumults of their relationship, they get to face one more curve ball this time. Their ghost friend Fabian introduces them to another ghost named Elisabeth who has a request for the couple. She's been hunting a guy by the name of the Inquisitor for centuries. He was the reason behind her death and even with his own death he hasn't stopped. Every Halloween he gets a human to kidnap three women who he believes to be witches, and he burns them at the stake. \n Cat and Bones don't like the sound of this guy and promise to help. They start by employing a medium by the name of Taylor - a very fresh character for this series - and open the gates to allow the Inquisitor through. He doesn't like being summoned, especially by a woman and because it's Cat, she doesn't keep her mouth shut either by telling him that she has witch power in her veins. Stupid move, Cat, real stupid. Because of this, he makes it his mission to hunt her down and attack her with every opportunity he gets. The first time they face off he is taken back by her power to raise the Remnants, but like with Cat's other borrowed powers, it does eventually fade. \n So now they need to come up with a new plan to take down this evil spirited ghost and... well, who you gonna call? The Ghostbusters, of course! Well, not really, but close enough. Add in the new head of Cat's old team who seems to have a vendetta not only against vampire but against Cat as well, and things get a little bit more intense than anyone bargained for."}

{"text": "Laia seorang budak, Elias seorang prajurit. Keduanya bukan orang merdeka. \n OH WOW! \n Saya melihat betapa hype-nya buku ini di kalangan bookish di luar negeri tahun 2015 lalu. Pujian juga dilontarkan oleh banyak pihak, apalagi ini adalah novel debut dari penulisnya; An Ember in the Ashes dinilai terlalu bagus sebagai sebuah novel debut, sehingga banyak pihak yang menyatakan bahwa tidak menyangka bahwa novel sebagus itu ternyata merupakan novel debut. Kurang lebih seperti itu. Jadi, ketika akhirnya saya melihat Penerbit Spring menerjemahkan novel ini, saya langsung membelinya ketika masa promo baru dimulai. Kemudian, ketika buku sudah tiba di tangan saya dan saya juga sudah dalam proses untuk membaca bukunya, saya melihat update dari Penerbit Spring di tanggal 2 Desember yang menyatakan bahwa semua pembeli di masa promo akan mendapatkan set bookmark gratis! Yeay! Dan sehari setelah Penerbit Spring memberikan informasi mengenai free bookmark set ini, set-nya sudah terkirim ke alamat saya. Double yeay! \n Okay... Back to the book... Setelah akhirnya saya merasakan sendiri pengalaman membaca An Ember in the Ashes, the hype surrounding this book is entirely understandable. \n Setting mengadaptasi konsep Romawi Kuno, dengan unsur fantasi a la Arabian Nights, dilengkapi juga dengan gambaran kehidupan masyarakat yang menjunjung konsep strata sosial. Saya sulit menahan diri dari godaan cerita yang menggabungkan unsur mitologi, fantasi, folklore, sejarah, dan isu-isu sosial. Ah, you name it. I'm sold! Hahaha. \n Kesan yang terasa itu dark yet beautiful. Ada pula kesan mystical and mysterious. Saya merasa sulit untuk menemukan kata-kata yang betul-betul pas untuk menggambarkan dengan rinci bagaimana pengalaman saya selama membaca An Ember in the Ashes, tidak semuanya berjalan mulus dan ada beberapa plot-hole. Tetapi menurut saya, hal-hal tersebut terasa minor, karena yang jelas, I really enjoyed the experience and it left me satisfy. \n Tadi saya sudah saya sebutkan bahwa buku ini dark. Kesan dark ini sinergis dengan kesan brutal. Iya, buku ini brutal dan membuat saya ngilu; mulai dari pembunuhan peperangan, pelecehan, ancaman, kekerasan... you name it... semuanya digambarkan dengan blak-blakan. Ditambah juga dengan inner struggle yang dihadapi oleh tokoh-tokohnya, keinginan untuk mendapatkan kebebasan, keharusan untuk tunduk patuh terhadap aturan, dan lainnya. \n Kesannya, kasar. Sangat kasar. Tapi, memang kehidupan sebagai budak dan prajurit tidak lepas dari hal-hal yang bersifat kasar, kan? \n Karakter-karakternya juga tidak digambarkan perfect, mereka punya sisi lemah masing-masing; terutama our OTP Elias dan Laia. Tetapi justru itulah yang membuat An Ember in the Ashes terasa perfect. Kita diajak untuk melihat perjuangan mereka untuk mencapai tujuan masing-masing, walaupun itu artinya mereka akan menghadapi kemungkinan terburuk; mati. Di sinilah inner struggle mereka terlihat. Karakter Helene dan Keenan juga menarik. Bahkan, gambaran villain di buku ini juga sangat menarik untuk dikaji -- seperti di The Lunar Chronicles, tokoh main villain di buku ini juga perempuan; Blackcliff. \n Sebagai pemuja karakter perempuan yang strong and tough, saya suka dengan bagaimana Sabaa Tahir menggambarkan karakter Laia -- Laia bukan orang yang tiba-tiba strong, apalagi tangguh. Tapi dia berjuang untuk menjadi seperti itu dan melawan ketakutannya sendiri. Dia juga bukan gambaran elite heroine, dia hanya gadis biasa yang begitu mencintai keluarganya dan terbiasa berada di bawah rasa aman -- sebelum dia harus mengambil keputusan yang nantinya mengubah jalan hidup dia secara keseluruhan. \n All in one; seperti gambaran buku distopian-fantasy modern lainnya, yang lebih banyak memasukkan genre YA di dalamnya, ide ceritanya mungkin tidak baru ya. The Hunger Games series, Divergent series, dan The Lunar Chronicles series itu kurang lebih membawa isu serupa. Tapi, sama seperti ketika saya membaca Cinder pertama kali, saya merasakan kepuasan. Hal yang tidak begitu saya dapatkan ketika mengikuti The Hunger Games dan Divergent series di buku-buku pertamanya. \n Saya sangat tidak sabar untuk membaca sekuel An Ember in the Ashes, yaitu A Torch Againts the Night. Semoga tidak perlu menunggu terlalu lama untuk bisa membaca buku ke-2. Walaupun mungkin saya harus banyak-banyak-banyaaaaaaaak sekali bersabar dalam mengikuti series ini karena yang saya tahu, buku ke-3 saja baru akan terbit di tahun 2018. Dan setelah beberapa bulan lalu mengikuti sebuah artikel yang mengatakan bahwa series ini akan dibuat menjadi 4 buku, berarti saya harus memperbanyak kadar kesabaran dalam mengikuti series ini yes? Hahaha."}

Seems that Raul, a Fae noble, has the ability to trap his subjects in his art--quite literally. And, he is certain a few more paintings will satisfy his sexual urges. \n Deidre is well aware of Raul's exploits--but she's got a plan to deal with his magic, and perhaps make some of her own. In her mansion she houses two sexual submissives, Claire and Sophia. Claire is a buxom blonde and Sophia is a sultry redhead. Neither woman really wishes for Raul's attention, but they are compliant to Deidre's whim--and Deidre's desires. \n This erotic twist on the THREE LITTLE PIGS folk tale is a sensual read. It presents women of all body types is a flattering sexual light; Raul is captivated by each for different reasons, but he adores the differences in their bodies with a lustful painter's eye. \n The sexual tension builds slowly, with alternating POV between Deidre and Raul. He believes the set-up to be one-sided, but Deidre is as crafty as the come. And, do they come. The smexytimes are interesting and well-described. They range from vanilla to BDSM to menage and from M/F to F/F/F and keep the pace building to the ultimate bondage. \n It is a quality erotic short, easily read over the course of a long, sexy lunch. I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review."}

{"text": "While I am a fan of all things Sookie, I am apparently not a die-hard fan. It took me a couple of weeks to trudge through this book. It opened with an excellent novella, \"Small-Town Wedding\", which did fill in a gap in the series. There were also a few other good entries from Charlaine Harris with background information on the short stories that are out there, answers to fan questions and an essay by Sookie on the various creatures she has interacted with. But a large bulk of this book was contributed by fans who have obsessively detailed each novel and story. These include trivia, recipes, a map, a time line, and an exhaustive (and exhausting) glossary that includes every character, place or item ever referenced in a Sookie Stackhouse book or story. That last entry ran about 150 pages and was very repetitive. I appreciate the work put into creating this collection but it was work to read it too. I may now have reached Sookie saturation."}

There is also more action in this book, which flows nicer together then the first one. I do love the action, which is described nicely. \n A few things I didn't like, if the writing grew he still at times tends to over use words. Doughy to describe any skin really irked me. And the dad, I would love this book if Max's dad could take it from a 25 and tone it down to maybe a 7. \n Other then that I fell that if the first book hadn't been so blatently a rip off of Harry Potter, that this book would do better.

This is where I will leave you, the reader, to see what happens next--it is so much more heart-filling when reading. Will his weakness deepen their heartaches, or will their hearts come together to give each other strength in a time of mourning?"}

{"text": "I really enjoyed the first part that takes place in the real world, but just as with Mythago Wood, I found the story confusing and muddled once the action shifted to the wood itself. Some have faulted Holdstock for losing control of the story, but I wonder if this was part of his point. No matter how much preparation you do, and no matter how much you think you understand it, once you enter the wood you will forget all your training and do nothing more than struggle to get out again. That's the moral I came up with, anyway."}

{"text": "3.5 STARS Sean has had a Fated existence. As his Father's warrior, and pawn, he acted from anger and rage, thirsting for blood and destruction. There was always this tiny part of good in him that had been seen as a weakness for a long time. When deciding for himself what is right and wrong and defying his Father's wishes Sean stands up for the goodness that had begun to prevail as a major entity inside of his being--balance. Balance was what he was supposed to be looking for and not ultimate power. After bargaining and a bit of manipulation, Sean gets his opportunity to choose right over wrong. No longer under his father's thumb, he builds strength and credibility--power. And what he will do with this new balance and power...I cannot wait to see. \n I went with this rating because of the brutal nature of his life. I could not connect with character, which probably had to do with my personal distance over a static character. I loathed all the manipulation and games and how they overpowered any kind of emotion or connection."}
{"text": "Rewrite Redemption is an interesting Young Adult story which I think will appeal to a lot of people. Two teenagers, A.J. and Constantine are dealing with a lot, lousy home lives, guilt over things that have happened to others in their lives that they blame themselves for, trying to fit in at school and being a normal teen. Only neither of them is normal. Constantine knows that he is an Editor for the Guild - he can time travel, draws his energy from trees. A.J. doesn't understand how come she can jump time. She never knows when it's going to happen until the moment it does. \n Constantine makes a big mistake that only hurts his brother in ways he can't forgive himself but because he used his gift for personal reasons, he loses the ability to time travel. And then his parents uproot him and his brother, thinking a new environment will suit them all. He loses his connection to the tree that has been feeding him energy since birth. \n The characters are well developed. I have to say that my favorite was Lexi. She was very kick-ass. iPod was an interesting person as well. \n I have to say that this story went from a 5 to a 4 to a 5 to a 4, it was all really good just some parts I found more interesting. But I will say the ending definitely kicked it up to a 5. There were some twists I didn't see coming. Whoohoo. Loved it. I look forward to more from this author. \n I was given a copy of this book for a review but the opinion is all mine."}

The whole world is really developed and I liked that while there are lots of characters it really revolves around Will and the Rangers. \n Not much happens as far as the \"War\" so maybe there will be more to that. Same audience that liked Harry Potter will enjoy this book hopefully and it'll get the following it deserves."}
{"text": "I finally finished it. \n This novel was fairly good. I think it will hold much appeal to many a reader. I wasn't very fond of the plot line, purely since I felt it to be a bit \" draggy\" in some instances. The idea behind the character within another character was very well set out. I loved it. \n There was a bit of a cliche alert in Steph's writing as I felt as if she did have a love for her \"love triangles\" and overly unselfish main characters but as a whole in the end I was satisfied. \n Wasn't very fond of the body she used for her main character in the end as the character was built up to be strong - her body in the end sounded like one of those girls you get that are just pretty with no brains. \n In a nutshell - different but vibrant. \n Holding thumbs for the movie as it's going to be interesting to see how they portray it."}

{"text": "Perfect. \n This book was realistic enough that I imagined I was friends with these kids (back in the day, of course...) and that I was right along with them on the bus, on the sailboat, in the library. It was also just spooky enough that I was glad to really just be reading about it and not actually on the quest, too. \n I loved how Holly Black explored the boundaries of friendships and growing up and being sure and certain about things at the same time. \n Doll Bones was a perfect blend of real and make believe. Often, the lines between them merging and grey. This is the perfect kind of book. One you relish in and so badly want to be real, but are grateful for the nightlight next to your bed!"}

I just wanted to find out why Kaylee had this special and scary power, to find out why all these young and healthy girls were dying. A few things were predictable but most were surprises that I did not see coming. \n I'm so glad Kaylee had Nash, he was always there for her and at times the only person. Her family gave off the vibe that they thought she was weird or crazy, even though they shouldn't have. I felt bad that she couldn't talked to them about what was really going on with her. One of the discoveries was very sad to me and my heart went out to Kaylee. I'm looking forward to continuing this series and see what happens next:)"}
{"text": "The first chapter was really sorta freaky. For a ya book this was really \"out\" there as far as the creep factor. There is no way as a child I would have read this, and a part of me was a little creeped out about what happened in the book the more I think about it. Okay being honest I'm really creeped out by it but I try not to think of it. \n I would have loved to see more about the toys and have that a little more expanded upon. Which it's sort of a mystery. \n There is a lot of violence and really bad things that happen to the kids which makes it not that suitable for the younger readers. The ending is unexpected and just not what I was expecting or rooting for. \n The style of the story is a little different. Instead of the storyplaying out for you instead the author is more likely telling you the story as a story teller would. There's very little dialogue instead you're told what happened instead of it being set in front of you. \n Oh and if you ever encounter a doll with sharp teeth make sure you tell the truth :)"}

{"text": "The soul has seen too much. She knows more than a soul should know.She can't keep her memories. The choice will be an unfair one if she does. ~The Deity \n I've read the whole series and finished Ceaseless last night; well what should I say besides that it was way better then the previous ones; no MUCH BETTER! \n Would I ever fall in love with Death? Hell yeah, if he comes in the package of Dank, any time ;) \n The third book starts off a lil weird. The author choses to start the book with quotes fromt he previous books and at the beginning it was a tat clueless till I've read the quote from the Deity that tells Dank aka Death that Pagan's memory will be erased cause she has seen and knows too much. Acoording to the Creator, Pagan has her soul's mate who should be/is Jay and the she must choose for herself. \n The unfair part is that her soul and heart craves still remembers and loves Dank unconditionally but her mind is totally clueless; therefore, she ends up pretty confused-poor thing. \n Every moment she has spent with you will be taken from her memories. She won't remember meeting Death and your breaking the rules to save her. She won't remember fighting for you. She won't remember the curse she suffered while under the spell of the voodoo spirit. It will all be washed clea. \n Poor Dank, I felt sorry for him. Now that Death knows and feels love, and now that he had Pagan finally back he has to win her and their love back all over again :( \n The story made me laugh and warmed my heart; i really like the POV's of Dank, reading how much he wants her back and would do anythig for her. But there's one problem, Dank is not allowed to tell her her memories got erased or help her remember with power. \n If you want her, Dankmar, then you have to win her heart from the soul made to be her mate. Only then will it be possible for you to keep her for eternity. \n Yeah you got the point, the Creator makes it really hard but Dank wouldn't be Dank if he didn't try his hardest ;) \n My fav side character in this book was Gee, she a transporter for the dead souls and seriously she cracked me up!!! She was pure joy to read and I loved her! \n Still, the book has some flaws like the other books. Some situations seemed to just be randomly thrown in to fill in the blanks. Some scenes with Jay didn't make sense and I asked myself why did Abbi even bother to write it down. The biggest bummer was that the book ended at 88% on my Kindle- wth- and I thought my kindle broke.The end felt too rushed and I would have loved to read more about their happy ending :-/ ... It is annoying the the Kindle verion ends way before 90% and then continues with the first chapters from her previous books! \n Overall, it was a good read but this series won't be my fav because of it's many flaws. I've read so many great book(series) that I can tell I'm spoilt. Maybe it was a mistake that I've read it right after Obsidian -Lux series because they're just awesome !!"}
{"text": "2.5 STARS I want to give this more because the characters and decent story line kept me completely invested in finding out what happens, however, I hated the switching of narrative styles in the beginning. The editing is poor. And I found myself skimming by the last few chapters in certain areas ( especially when Leah goes on and on about how things look or her personal dilemmas)."}
{"text": "4.25/4.5 STARS \n There's something so hypnotic about these books that appreciate and love so much. As with Angelfall , I found myself deciding to \"read a chapter or two\" of World After before bed only to look up and realize that it's 5AM and I finished the book. \n The writing is fantastic, and there's constantly so much happening that you can't help but be completely immersed as you read, and don't even get me started on the characters!! I just love Penryn and Raffe so much!! I do wish that we got a bit more interaction between them because their sassy interactions are simply the best; however, given the circumstances, I understand why that wasn't the case. \n Also, the whole Pooky Bear situation? HILARIOUS! And Raffe laughing and then crying after realizing that Penryn was alive? My poor tender heart! And just all of their interactions after that! I really missed sassy Penryn, and I just missed Raffe in general throughout the first half. They're just great together! OTP! OTP! \n Highly recommend this trilogy if you're in the mood for a really fun, fast-paced story with sarcastic, sassy characters you'll be likely to fall in love with! Seriously, it's so good! \n (Might edit this a bit later, but now I just need sleep.)"}

I was weary of Kel in the first couple of books but I fell in love with her over the course of this book. \n I am so excited for the fourth one.

{"text": "Jackie says: \n Sit up and take notice vampire fans, there is a new dynamic duo writing a spine tingling, fast paced and very smart trilogy that's going to hit the genre like a storm. \"The Strain\" is the first book and sets up the concept of what amounts to a biological attack by a rogue master vampire on the human race, starting in NYC. The main humans that are fighting against it are two doctors from the CDC, an old holocaust survivor who has been tracking this particular vampire all of his life, and an exterminator who specializes in rats. It's an interesting collection that works very, very well. The momentum of this book is relentless--by the second night of the infection, you won't be able to put it down. It's going to be a frustrating wait until this time next year for the second book to come out."}

I adore Angel's characters and her ability to keep a story moving forward with increasing intensity. \n This book has tied so many things up. A true full circle...outcast to fulcrum of a society...missing pieces to reunited families...innocence to evil and back to good (but not quite innocent). \n I would definitely recommend this YA series to readers who enjoy a paranormal journey in which characters slowly grow into what they are destined to be."}

{"text": "\"I lost myself the moment I found you.\" \n With those words Roth, the demon Crown Prince of Hell, wiggled his way into my heart and didn't let go! My gut feeling told me from the very first pages that Roth is the man for Layla - the hybrid, half demon, half Warden. He accepts her how she is; she can be free with him, no boundaries, and no denying. He makes her feel alive and happy - carefree even. So you can imagine after sacrificing himself so Zayne could live, Layla's life wasn't the same anymore (and mine *sniffs*). She was grieving badly even though they hadn't put a label on their relationship, Layla knew deep down, Roth being gone, there's a big void in her heart that no-one could fill. \n OMG! She's done it again....J. Armentrout put a spell on me with her fantastic new YA paranormal series. I was hooked right when she published the pre-novella; right here and then I knew this new series will be a success. She proved after deeply loving the Lux books that she's the queen of YA paranormal/supernatural books for me. Her books are on auto-click and so far she hasn't disappointed me. \n In her Dark Element series she puts her readers through an emotional roller coaster, letting us experience and feel for Layla's torn feelings. Who should she pick? Save and handsome Zayne or fun, daring, alluring Roth? It's a tough choice. We are all bidding our bets since book 1, White Hot Kiss, with who she'll end up with. J. Armentrout crushed our fan-girling hearts at the end of White Hot Kiss and I wanted to throw my kindle away...but, she's as wicked as her books. \n In Stone Cold Touch we see how Layla and Zayne get a bit too cozy (for my taste) even though she can't forget Roth. Her feelings are all over the place and all of a sudden Zayne is more than just a big brother, a secrete crush, her first love.... now she's allowed to taste him; feel him; show her feelings. But this new-found happiness is short lived (thank goodness!!) because Roth is back!! He's back with an agenda because some serious stuff has gone wrong and a Lilin got created -BAD NEWS, ladies. \n Now here she is...torn between two man - both loving her deeply. \n \"Love is a strange creature one thinks has a grasp on and understanding of, only to discover later that it was only the barest taste of the real thing.\" \n Sighs... this book kept me on edge because Roth is one hard guy to read and Armentrout put some secrets in the story that got later on revealed...she had me worried!! Every word, every action from Roth had his purpose and Armentrout weaved such details perfectly into her story - I was hooked, spellbound even. \n \"I want you so badly it's like a hunger that gnaws at me endlessly. It doesn't go away.\" \n Me = goner! \n If you haven't gotten the chance to dive into her new series then you're missing out; it's top notch recommendation material! I can't wait to read book #3 and in case you didn't see it, YOU CAN VOTE with who Layla should end up with. Well you all know my choice (you better support it...JUST KIDDING, really): ROTH! But seriously give your vote because after that Jennifer will write book 3 - better pick the right dude ;) \n !!!!

Sure, I remembered Leila and Vlad and all the crazy shenanigans that they had been going through and something major had happened at the end of the last book. But that was about it.

{"text": "Eh. This fourth installment soured the series for me."}
{"text": "This book takes a bit of getting into as it's fairly slow to start but it's well worth it because it ends with a bang! \n There isn't so much a creepy scary part to it as the build up leaves a lot of suspense and it's very much a YA book. \n Those that are looking for the poetic writing of Zafon won't find it in this book. It's more straight forward with a bit of descriptions. Nothing like the other books. \n The characters were well drawn out and the whole story is well rounded and developed. Though I didn't understand what happened to the main character's little sister I don't understand WHY it happened was it just because Cain was coming? That was a little unclear for myself but I loved this book, the setting and the characters. \n Very realistic story with a touch of magic and suspense."}
{"text": "It took me a few tries to complete reading this book. That I continued to go back says a lot about what I thought of the story. I didn't realize, until the end notes, that this is a re-telling of the Dickens's classic A TALE OF TWO CITIES, not that it mattered at all to me. I've not read that book and it may have helped me get through this one faster, but I doubt it. \n Lucie lives in a divided city--New York City, in some futurescape where magic reigns and those who practice Light magic live in beautiful, wondrous Manhattan, while those who practice Dark magic are relegated to the Dark city. My relations in Brooklyn would not be impressed that their property would house the most despised denizens of this magical realm. Lucie was born in the Dark city to parents of Light magic. It's a rarity, and she escaped by the help of her aunt. Lucie helped her father escape magical persecution, and became known as the Golden Thread in the Dark, for all her efforts to bring attention to the suffering there. She, or rather her persona, is a rallying point for the growing revolution in the Dark city. \n Lucie is dating Ethan Stryker, nephew of the most powerful man in Light city. They have a physical relationship, but Lucie hides all her Dark secrets from Ethan. For him, and all, she is the perfect young woman. Agreeable, pleasant, undemanding, barely noticeable; she lives in constant dread of Ethan's uncle rescinding her ability to stay in Light city, and condemning her and her father to Dark exile. Ethan seems captivated by Lucie, in love with her, but she doesn't trust this, due to her own issues of trust. Ethan also has a dark secret, one we learn in the very beginning; he has a doppelganger, Carwyn, the product of Dark magic performed when he was a baby to save Ethan's life. Dopplegangers are forbidden magic, and the Stykers hid Carwyn in the Dark city hoping he'd die before he was discovered. Not so. \n Ethan's life is nearly forfeit when Carwyn steps in. Lucie doesn't know how to handle it, but she also knows she can't abide Carwyn being abused, as he's been all his life, for being a doppleganger. Her magic is strong enough to alter Carwyn so he isn't immediately pegged as a doppleganger...and that's the beginning of the end, in many ways. \n I wasn't terribly impressed with the story, mostly because bloody rebellions are not my thing. Expect the revolution to come, and expect Lucie to get swept in despite her best attempts to do nothing, not be seen, and keep her family safe. The last item is pretty much the only redeeming quality Lucie possesses: deep family loyalty. She lies at every turn, hides her use of illegal magic, sends Ethan into a situation he can't possibly escape, and sets Carwyn free to wreak havoc as he sees fit. #MoveAlong #NothingToSeeHere *magic fingers* \n There's a *bit* of a love triangle, but not really, for me. I didn't sense a strong attachment in either direction for Lucie, for much of the book, and Carwyn played things way too close to the vest for me to see anything but teasing. When his big reveal came I suppose I had a better understanding of him, but it only magnified the melancholy. I often wondered at the direction the story was taking, sure that I'd missed some key piece of information that would help it make better sense, but I didn't. I suspected Lucie's aunt to be exactly who she was, and had no real understanding their manners to each other after their tumultuous reunion. Lucie hides so much of herself I got lost in her head, and that wasn't good because she's impetuous and secretive at the same time. \n I imagine the end follows closely to that of the Dickens tale, but it was an absolute downer for me, as a reader. Just when I thought the day might be won, well, nope. So, don't expect a happy ending. I also had more terror over the possibility that this book might continue into a sequel, than regarding the peril in which the characters were mired. For those who abhor a cliffhanger ending, I'm happy to report: it's a self-contained story. I received a review copy of this book via NetGalley."}

{"text": "In every sense for what it is, this book is absolutely perfect. \n I liked the first novel of the Raven Cycle. It had a great sense of character and an atmosphere and style that I immediately fell in love with. But it also was inconclusive, even for a first book. It started a whole lot without finishing anything. It felt incomplete, even as a first entry. \n The Dream Thieves improves upon almost every aspect of this. \n As a continuation, a part of a series, it is great. There is a continuation of the questions of the first entry. We see an intentional but organic growth of these characters. We get some answers, but not too many. \n As its own novel, it is impressive as all hell. I may be slightly biased because this novel centers on my favorite (and who I believe to be the most compelling) character. But everything here feels so perfectly crafted. The scenes are fun and perfectly paced. It just sweeps by, but without feeling empty or insubstantial. Maggie's writing is wonderfully visual and original. It is true to the characters while at once having a life of its own. It fits perfectly well with the commendable originality of Maggie's brand of fantasy. \n I am just so happy that Maggie found an exciting, fun, and memorable story that she can do service to in a single book. She has crafted one of the best single volumes of a series that I have read. I can't wait to see what else she has in store."}

{"text": "After Dead isn't exactly a book. It's more of a postscript. This volume is designed for the Sookie Stackhouse fangirl (or fanboy) who has read every book and every short story set in that universe. It is an alphabetical list of every character (minor or major) who appeared in the prior publications. It then tells you what happened to them after the final book was written. Some pages merely have a single line of print. So, it only took a couple of hours to read the entire thing. The main points of interest were the couple of characters whose write-up contained a hint that we might be hearing more of their life story at a later date.

The magic, the friendships between the girls at the boarding school, and their own feelings of inadequacy and insecurity that cements the bond between them, all combine for a fanciful read. Libba Bray enofolds the story of Gemma Doyle and \"The Order\"in an enchanting fashion. For a fantasy book, this is one of the better ones. I enjoyed it. I would give this book 3 1/2 stars, but I guess I will round up and give it 4 stars."}

I also would have liked to find out more about his background, and the world of the angels. I guess I'll have to wait for the sequel."}
{"text": "See full review for A Discovery of Witches at: http://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.w... \n Diana Bishop is a witch not that she actually uses her powers. In fact, since her parents' horrific deaths when she was seven, she made a promise to herself that she wouldn't use her magic. Ever. But like with most promises, she breaks it and only uses her magic occasionally. However, when she's not trying to not use her magic, she is a professor of alchemy and is doing research on manuscripts in the Oxford Library. One of the manuscripts she calls, Ashmole 782, isn't just an ordinary manuscript. It's bewitched, and with a simple press of her hand to the cover, Diana undoes the spell to read inside. \n This causes a chain reaction. Apparently, this manuscript hasn't been seen in almost a century and now Diana is being stalked by vampires, witches, and daemons that are trying to have her recall the book so that way that species can regain control of it and its secrets. The first to approach her is a vampire named Matthew, who instantly makes a connection with the witch. Much to the disdain of the other witches, daemons, and vampires, their bond grows and now it's not only a matter of getting the book from Diana, but trying to keep her to her own kind.

When The Girl from Everywhere first crossed my path, I gave it a hard pass. Books about time travel? Not really my thing. But then a few months ago it kept showing up, whether it was a friend who recommended it to me or just on the YA books tag on Pinterest, this book was stalking me. So I gave into the pressure and added it my reading list. \n And you know what? I don't regret it one bit."}

{"text": "Oh, how bittersweet. No more 1000 page novels in the series remain to screw up my 50 book goal for the year, and yet, I have no way of knowing when the next book will come out. I feel like the kids who followed Harry Potter in real time, except I am an adult with more patience and more self-control over my emotions. (I think.) How did those kids do it? \n The series is really entertaining. Though Martin is not some master of poetic prose, there's nothing wrong with his writing either. It's a perfectly adequate style with intense characters and a complicated plot. His real skill is in building characters that are complex and believable. There are obviously good characters and obviously bad characters, but the majority of characters are richly complex - sometimes you hate them; sometimes you sympathize with them. \n It's not just the men that are well-developed either. Martin can write women - all kinds of women. And he understands these women, even the crazy ones. The character of Cersei Lannister is an amazing accomplishment. She is a nut job, but in a realistic way with female paranoia and preoccupations that I understand the root of though David, my husband, thought her characterization was just chalked up to Martin's writing of the most clinically cuckoo character he could think of. I had make an argument for some of Cersei's motivations that are often related to the balls out motherly instinct that is first and foremost concerned with the preservation of her children at the expense of everything else. \n I highly recommend this series. It has made me a harder reader as no character in the book can be expected to live out the series. Anything can happen to anyone. I have developed calluses on my brain and eyeballs after this series, and I think I'm better for it."}

{"text": "5th&up, 3.5 stars \n After an accident leaves them with seriously strange powers, 4 kids (& a sidekick) band together to keep themselves safe from a common enemy. Silly and fun, Ignatow adds depth and important issues to her story with her realistically portrayed middle school characters. \n Cookie is the popular girl, but she is fiercely protective of her status because she fears one wrong move will send her plummeting down the social scale- where she's sure some people think the only black girl in school belongs. Farshad is smart & confident but miserable & alone because every day he walks through school as a complete pariah- labeled Terror Boy simply because of his Iranian heritage. Jay- the sidekick- is goofy, loud, & energetic and uses overblown speech that constantly gets him in trouble and provides levity to the book. With occasional language better suited for middle school (bastard, ass), this is a fun and fast paced story, with a twist ending that will have students dying for the next volume. \n That being said, this stellar School Library Journal review by Betsy Bird \n http://blogs.slj.com/afuse8production... \n is definitely on point when it refers to the problematic language Jay uses when describing his crush- he calls Cookie a Nubian princess and a delicate black orchid, among other unsettling phrases. Reading about Farshad's experiences with prejudice and bullying is also seriously disturbing, but sadly believable at the same time. \n All in all, despite some problems The Mighty Odds is a layered and entertaining story that is sure to be popular with middle school readers."}
{"text": "In full disclosure, I didn't even realize this was a YA book when I picked it up. I knew it was Abercrombie, and I knew it was a fresh world, and that was enough for me to begin reading. \"Half A King\" is the story of Yarvin, a prince who wants nothing more than to be a Minister, learn some lore, and stay out of the light of day. Before the novel even gains too much traction, his father and brother are killed, leaving him the title of king. He's unprepared for the role, and being born with less than a full compliment of fingers on one hand, he is quick to be given the titular half a king. \n This being an Abercrombie novel, there should be no surprise that betrayal and a rapid change of fortune is the next step. The phases of this journey will be no surprise to the seasoned reader of fantasy. A boy, cast into the world, must find out who he really is, rising from a somewhat despicable, sniveling child to an adult that knows his own strengths and weaknesses and how to use them to achieve his objective. You come to this story expecting an Abercrombie fantasy, but you stay because despite some of its predictable elements, its told really, really well. The reader will recognize a world that is both familiar and a degree or two off of our own. Like many good fantasies, Abercrombie doesn't try and hide the grit behind feats of magic and enchanted swords. There was magic in the world once, and we occasionally get glimpses of the enchantment that was, but this world is firmly between cold iron and hot blood. \n My only criticism of this novel, and the reason I didn't think it warranted a full five stars, was that I found the conclusion to be a little too trite and pat. It could be that I am too jaded a reader, too far removed from the intended audience to be surprised by the final twist, but I found it to be a little too convenient. \n That said, I would still recommend the book to readers old and young alike, although in fairness some topics may be less appropriate for younger teens - not because the writing is difficult for younger readers, but because some of the content may not be appropriate. \n This review was of the digital ARC provided by Del Rey via Netgalley. Thank you to both parties for the opportunity to read this book in advance - it's been hard holding this review until closer to publication :)"}

{"text": "I'd give this three and a half stars if that were an option. I liked this book, but got bored at certain points. Granted, it's not really the author's fault that I have such a short attention span. The plot was well thought out, the Norse legend stuff was kind of cool. I liked the introduction of Pixies who weren't evil, and I especially liked how Zara's skin kept turning blue. That was a very cool twist. \n The ending was a tad abrupt, but not so much so that it made me angry or anything. I will definitely look for the third book in the series when it comes out later this year. In fact I can't wait."}

{"text": "This is one fine vampire novel. But it's so much more than that because of the way Lindqvist treats his characters and the way he navigates the narrative. Although there are two central protagonists--Oskar and Eli (and one could make an argument for Hakan as a third)--Lindqvist treats the baker's dozen or so minor characters (and the dozen or so more really minor characters) with just as much care. There are no bad guys; there are no throwaway characters. There are angry children from broken homes trying to hold on to some particle of a remembered happiness, even if it's only a secondhand remembrance; there are boys trying to navigate school and the castes that come with any lunchroom, classroom, field-trip, or after school activity; there are lonely adults seeking out like-minded souls in hopes of making their days and nights less isolated; there is even a squirrel looking for a nut who is a minor (very minor) character for about a page. \n But because of the omniscient narrative Lindqvist uses, the reader gets insight into each and every one of the characters and feels at least at bit of sympathy, and sometimes empathy, for each, even if their actions are unfortunate, mistaken, misunderstood, or just plain despicable. And Lindqvist's ability to create this effect ultimately shows that he is both interested in and has the ability to observe, understand, and explain human behavior. So although this is, technically, a vampire novel, it's a great character study and commentary about adolescence, nostalgia, human nature, suburban living, and the ability to do violence."}
{"text": "I loved this book until about 100 pgs from the end. Ugh. It just seemed to go on and on. Granted, I read the book for story and plot; I was not too focused on picking out the rich symbolism or allegorical evidence. That being said, I'm sure I missed some gems, but I felt that the ending of the book tainted all the wonderful-ness of the story. The author seemed to just \"quit.\" It's like he had no credible way to end an incredible story, so he rains on our (the readers') parade by offering us a realistic alternative. I also didn't like how the book did not circle back to the beginning i.e. the struggling author meeting Pi and re-telling his story. I think bringing the narrative back around to the modern scenario outlined at the beginning of the book would have been a better way to cap off the rich story. \n I loved the way the author was able to make life stranded at sea captivating. Day after day, Pi and Richard Parker do the same things, but I still found myself hooked. Because I'm kind of--alright, alright, I'm definitely--obsessed with my cat, I found it hard to picture Richard Parker in a dangerous light. I just kept thinking, \"Oh, a kitty! He's so cute and soft!\" It was wise of the author to constantly remind us of Richard Parker's power and prowess. Overall, a great read well worth the time. I'm excited to see how they adapt it to a movie!"}
{"text": "Another fabulous installment of the BDB series! \n J.R. Ward manages to keep me gripped for the duration of all her books with her unique style (always guaranteed to read one of these books in only one or two sittings). She beautifully balances romance and hot sex with lots of action and humour, continually moving from scene to scene, keeping the story moving along at a fast pace. \n I really enjoyed Tohr's story particularly following his terrible emotional struggle after losing Wellsie. He deserved so much happiness. It was wonderfully heart-stopping as J.R. Ward threw in some twists and turns at the end! \n Of course, I mainly read these books now to follow Qhuinn and Blaylock. So I put off reading Lover Reborn to this month so that I could read just before the release of Lover At Last. So well worth it for the teaser provided at the end! Luckily I now only have to wait a couple of weeks!"}
{"text": "For more reviews, check out Keep Calm and Love Books \n I don't exactly know how I did it but I managed to read this whole book in about 4 hours... That is the BEST record time I have for reading a book. I'm pretty proud of myself and clearly this book lived up to it's hype by how fast I read it. I honestly just seemed to speed through it and wanting needing to know how this book will end! I really liked the world this was set in. I felt as if it was so different and unique that it was refreshing to read about. The politics, history and war in this world is just amazing. I LOVED reading all about the past and what happened with the war between Herrani and Valorians. It was interesting to read that the Herrani's were the ones on 'top' before the 'brutish' Valorians came and took it from them. Instead of causing excitation with the Herrani race, the Valorians took them as slaves. Pretty sad for the Herrani's. Obviously towards the end of the book I wasn't a big fan of the race but I get why both sides did what they did. The great thing about this book was that the politics, history and even the way the dystopian world was, it was so logical. I actually made sense of what was law and the rituals/customs they had. I've never read anything by Rutkoski but I really like her writing and how she made this dystopia so believable and understood. I didn't find myself confused at any of the 'ways of life' the Valorian's lived as well as the Herrani. \n As for the characters!!!! Let's start with: \n Kestrel: Absolutely amazing. I've always said my favourite protagonist from any book had to either be Celaena from Sara J. Mass's, Throne of Glass series or Taryn from Tijan's, A Whole New Crowd series. Well, Kestrel definitely tops those by a long shot! I was so impressed that Rutkoski managed to make her so strong and liked even though physically, she wasn't much of a fighter. Instead, her main weapon was her mind. In the beginning chapters her father even compliments her saying, \n \"Her father gave her a level look. \"Your military strength has never been in combat.\" Which was another way of saying that she was a poor fighter. More gently, he said, \"You're a strategist.\" Kestrel shrugged. Her father said, \"Who suggested I draw the Dacran barbarians into the mountains when they attacked the empire's eastern border?\"All she had done then was point out the obvious. The barbarians' over reliance on cavalry had been clear. So, too, had been the fact that the dry eastern mountains would starve horses of water.\" \n I mean... It's pretty clear she knows her shit and she's very talented in the sense that she knows how to think her way out of any problem! We do however get to see her physical strength get put to the test, which to be honest, was one of my favourite scenes in the WHOLE book. The fight she had with Irex was just laughable. She would have clearly lost if she hadn't used that strategist brain of hers and think her way out of being killed! I honestly think Kestrel was such a brilliant character, I can't wait to read her smart and witty mind in the next novel! \n Arin: The first time we get introduced to him and Kestrel described him was basically when I knew that this rough around the edges, hot ass looking dude would be our love interest. I, at first, liked him a lot! I thought he was great and understandable considering he was just bought to slave a family, I would be pretty hostile as well. And finally when we get that knowledge that he's actually not all innocent as he seemed and what he had been doing around the house not innocent AS WELL. Well....... I kind of freaked. I almost put the book away because I couldn't stand him anymore. I can say 100% having finished the book now, I still very much dislike Arin. Maybe the next book will change that but honestly, that betrayal and then for him to expect her to still be all lovey eyed with him.. As Cher would say from Clueless, AS IF. \n Jess: From the beginning to the end, I always liked Jess. Her loyalty really shows towards the middle and that touching devotion Kestrel shows Jess at the end is truly touching. I LOVED Jess. She was such a breath of fresh air and seemed to be the perfect best friend Kestrel needed. It's not secret that Kestrel is a strange, not conforming to society norms, type of girl. And Jess is honest about that and even says so out loud about her friend. They are the two perfect duo that I'm sure we will be seeing a lot more of in the next book! Though, I wonder if the events that happened in the last chapter of this book will throw a rift between them two, concerning Ronan. And speaking of Ronan... \n Ronan: Super hot. Super available. In love with Kestrel. What's not to love back!?!? Well the fact that Kestrel knows in her heart that he's not for her. Towards the end I really did think Ronan had a chance, I was actually routing for him more than Arin, since my hatred for him was stronger than ever, but poor Ronan. He does get shot down indefinitely and I'm sad to say that I'm pretty sure tat ship has sailed 100%. We know he's Jess's brother but we don't really touch on their family other than the siblings. I wonder if we will get to learn more of their family and how they are so close to the general's daughter. \n General Trajan: I just wanted to touch upon this character because Rutkoski really did go all out with her characters and made the stereotypical father in charge not so typical in this book. It was a welcome refreshment when I realized that the general isn't all that mean and typical 'dad' like in many YA dystopia novels. I actually quite like Kestrel's father and I'm glad we'll get to read about him in the next book. After what's happened now, I hope we'll actually get to see more of him and understand him better! I liked how he could be nice and caring yet have that fatherly figure in him. He made sure that his daughter knew he was to be obeyed but not out of cruelty or oppressiveness, but out of caring and the love he had for his daughter and her safety. He was just another one of Rutkoski's great characters in this series. \n The book ended with a satisfying cliff hanger for what is to come in the next, but it wasn't unbearable. I quite like how abruptly this ended and I'm pretty glad I read this so late because now all 3 books are out, YAY. Time to get reading and hopefully I'll have read the whole series by the end of this week, or at the rate I'm going, by at least Friday. Also, the cover is just so impeccable, definitely a plus for me!!!!!!! LOVED THIS!"}
{"text": "4 Love can conquer all stars! \n Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Author & Inkslinger Pr \n Genre: Paranormal Romance \n Standalone \n My Lucian Divine Review . . . \n I absolutely love Renee Carlino. EVERY SINGLE BOOK of hers is refreshing and different and outside of the normal formulas that are too often used within the genres she writes in. In the preface, Renee says 'this book is about faith, love, the unknown, and not taking ourselves so damn seriously all the time.' And that is EXACTLY what this book was about. She couldn't have summed it up better that that. \n Evey is wading through life. Living with her best friend, even if she's overbearing and messy. Dating, well unsuccessful dating. Has a career doing what she loves but she's not complete. On one of her dates she meets a mysterious man whom she has an instant connection with. Soon she finds out that this man is so much more. But can true love conquer all? \n Lucian is Evey's Guardian Angel and he's a drunk. It's way easier to drink then watch the love of your life date everyone but him. But how can an angel and a human be together? \n \"Jesus Christ!\" I mumbled. He turned back toward me, startled. \"Where?\" He didn't sound angry but surprised. \n The banter between these two is great. As Lucian is trying to understand a life he's familiar with yet its still completely foreign and Evey has finally found her mate. But how can it all work out? \n \"Great, so my guardian angle is a perverted narcissist\" \n Lucian and Evey have an instant connection but the ones above need Evey to not remember meeting Lucian in the first place. However, that's not as easy as it usually is. \n \"You're so human,\" she said. \"so flawed. I love you more because it it.\" \n Besides the amazing relationship of Lucian and Evey, the messages within this book are fantastic. \n \" . . . But swearing to God . . .\" \n \"What? It's frowned upon?\" \n \"No, it's just meaningless. People shouldn't lie to each other to begin with. People shouldn't have to fear hell in order to tell the truth. They should fear that their lies will ruin relationships or get them in trouble, here now, on Earth, with the people they love.\" \n True Love is never easy but always worth it in the end. For poor Lucian and Evey they had many trials and tribulations but love always wins. This book was refreshing and beautiful. It was full of love, faith, hope, hardship, misfortune, honesty and realism. I adored it and loved every second of this book. Their was so many great messages and provoking thoughts about what we know or think we know but now can maybe look at it in a different way. Lucian and Evey were perfect together and it was honor to read their journey."}

I'm not sure why I don't see it as much here, at the pinnacle of his story, as I did in the first book of this series or in The Eden Trilogy.

{"text": "This review was written for Joyfully Jay Reviews. \n 4.25 Stars for this contemporary M/M shifter romance. \n Tristan \"Trip\" Hagan is an out gay male in his tiny husky shifter community. He would have ordinarily been shunned, but he's the eldest male offspring to the Alpha of his clan. He has a bright, sensitive son, Robbie, who is the next heir to the clan Alpha as Trip is not eligible and Trip's younger brother is unable to produce any pups. Trip had bowed to his father's insistence to marry, despite knowing he was gay, but divorced his wife when he learned that she had a true mate within their clan. Trip may be willing to sacrifice his own happiness for clan loyalty, but he won't ask anyone else to do so. Trip also has a true mate, Boone, his half-wolf/half-husky Enforcer guard. Unfortunately, a mating between a pureblood (Trip) and a half-breed (Boone) is forbidden under clan law. So the men are close confidantes, but never take the next step--sealing their love by making a mating bond. \n The story is short but well-rounded with interesting secondary characters. Boone and his brother Hunter are both in love with men they cannot have. Being half-breeds, they are a target for scorn and abuse, despite their valiant hearts. There are also some juicy bits of humor to balance out the heartache. The spiders that were too big for the burly huskie shifters to tackle? I died. \n Within the story is a threat from outside the clan. Trip's father is negotiating an alliance with the nearby wolf pack whose Alpha, Kristoff Trevyn, is indisputably attracted to Trip. Yep. Which is all kinds of awkward, especially as Trip's dad is a raging homophobe. I really admired Kristoff; he is kind and compassionate and drives Boone bonkers. \n Robbie recognizes that Trip and Boone are meant for each other, and does try to orchestrate events to cultivate that. All of Trip's close comrades do, in fact. When the personal scrutiny of Trip and Boone gets too intense, there are only two choices: inter-clan battle, or separation. The resolution is almost excellent. The only problem becomes the main crux of the heartache that kicks off the sequel. \n Note: This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Love Has No Boundaries\" event and is available for free through that group or All Romance eBooks."}

{"text": "I obtained this ARC at BEA14, in exchange for an honest review. \n As has already been mentioned in a few reviews, the basic idea of Deadly Curiosities bears a striking resemblance to the short-lived but wonderfully cheesy Friday the 13th: the series television show from the late 1980s (yes, I am ancient) where the main characters are trying to take cursed or evil items and antiques out of the hands of naive, unsuspecting mortals. \n In Martin's book, Cassidy is a gifted human who owns the pawn shop where she, her friend/assistant manager Teag and her business partner/vampire mentor Sorren come across malignant trinkets and try to dispose of them before they can do too much harm. Unfortunately, there appears to be a powerful dark force at work in Charleston which is supercharging the dangerous objects the intrepid trio come across. If they don't figure out what's going on soon, their South Carolina city will be awash in black magic. \n This is the first book in the series, but since there are 10 prequel short stories available in ebook form, I occasionally felt like I had missed out on something. \n Despite a decent plot, I felt that this book dragged quite a bit. There were a few repetitive scenes (like two similar battles at different museums, one right after another), and other sections that didn't really advance the plot or increase the readers knowledge. With a little editing (and a lot more of Chuck- an entertaining character that only made an appearance in the last third of the book), the story could have been a lot more solid. \n As it stands, just squeaking in on the 3 star range."}

I spent hours with them and I know nothing. Why? because we were too busy talking about the possibility of losing our virginity to Shay who pushed and pushed to \"do it\".... I mean after all every girl just wants to do it because they are pushed to it. \n This whole book was a disappointment. I remember loving Nightshade and then this came along and I\"m like why did I even bother!"}
{"text": "I seem to be giving a lot of books 5 stars these days. I must be getting good at picking them out. \n Or perhaps the same magic that ran the circus in this book is transcending dimensions, and I too am enchanted. \n Regardless of if I am spellbound or not, this book, in my opinion, deserves 5 solid stars. The author has created a magical story, with complex characters and relationships, a mysterious storyline from various points of view that weaves through the years, moving forward and backward as needed. This is all skillfully done with beautiful prose that reveals only what is needed at that time. \n I must admit that I was confused early on. Not so much that I didn't understand what was going on, but I had to keep checking previous chapters to see if I'd missed something. Now that I've finished, I see that the author was dropping mysterious details to foreshadow things to be revealed later. There are questions that don't get answered until the last chapter even, questions that I had been asking since the very beginning. \n The summary of things in this book is this: Celia and Marco have grown up unusually, being trained in magic and illusion by their mentors in preparation for a competition, or a \"game\" as it is often referred to. Both become key players in a mysterious circus. They meet, and later realize they are each other's opponent in a game where, unbeknown to either of them, only one will be left standing at the end. A slow-building romance blossoms, which only raises the stakes. But when they are prepared to leave the circus, they find out there is far more at stake than just their well-being; there is a harmful domino effect that could reach everyone around them. \n The writing is luscious and rich, and somehow it still continues to move at a quick pace. Again, must be the magic. And the romance.... perfect. It was beautiful and painful, and somehow incredibly tangible, and just as electric as it is described in the book. \n To say I am left enchanted and captivated is probably an understatement, but it will have to suffice while I swim around in the magical fog of story that I just finished. Five solid stars, conjured by magic perhaps, but five nonetheless."}

Whenever she's asleep and by someone who is also asleep she goes into their dreams or nightmares. Before, she thought that because of this curse she was going to be forever alone, but then Cabel walked into her life and everything changed. Especially when he told her that she could use her gift for good and had her meet his boss a police Captain who has seen this gift before. After helping the police with a drug bust a month ago, Janie is now a part of the squad and this time around there's a bigger case afoot. \n Someone called the high school's anonymous tip line but despite using some of the best technology they can't make out what the person is saying other than some kind of party and rape. The police think it's a teacher at Janie and Cabel's high school and assigns Janie to go undercover to find the culprit. But while doing that she also has to figure out more to this dream catching thing, even if that means figuring out all the consequences that go with her ability. \n Okay, look, I've probably said it before when I was reading Wake, but this series of books is not for the people who are looking for well written literature."}

Instinctively trusting the handsome stranger, Alice agrees to a crazy and dangerous plan that might solve both of their problems, if it doesn't kill them first. \n As usual, Krentz has crafted a fast paced suspense story and populated it with two main characters that the reader gets immediately involved with. Alice is admirable with her rough past and determined nature, and although Drake has troubles of his own, I loved the way he still made Alice and their budding relationship a priority. \n This was fast paced fun from the first page to the last."}

{"text": "I read The Final Empire several months ago and knew I couldn't wait too long with reading the sequel, The Well of Ascension. The world in the Mistborn-trilogy is intense, as are the characters and the magic-system. Waiting too long would mean I would forget too much. But since I absolutely loved The Final Empire, it took me no trouble picking up this one. Just as with the first book, it took me a while to read. But o man, when I finished it... \n \"Well, I think it was a creature of some sort--a dark and evil thing that nearly destroyed the world. The Lord Ruler traveled to the Well of Ascension, where he was given the power to defeat the Deepness and unite mankind. There are several statues in the city depicting the event.\" \n The Final Empire has been overthrown now the Lord Ruler is dead; killed by Mistborn Vin. Even though it's still quite unknown to her how she had the power to kill him, she is now seen as The Heir of the Survivor and her powers are well known around the world. Kelsier may be dead and missed, Vin, Elend and the crew do anything to keep Luthadel standing. Which is quite difficult. Definitely if several armies decide to camp out before the capital with the intention to take control. Even more so when one of the armies is controlled by one of the crewmember's father, namely Elend. \n \"Sometimes a bad situation is still better than the alternative\" \n The Well of Ascension was intense and awesome. I thought I was going to miss Kelsier immensely, which I did, but Vin, Elend and the entire crew made up for his loss. I loved how Vin turned out to be this super bad ass mistborn, who can kick everyone's ass if she wanted to. I also like the love between Elend and Vin, even thought the endless paragraphs about her teenage doubts annoyed me sometimes (hence the four stars instead of five). I liked the addition of OreSeur, who spend a lot of time around Vin, and the mystery with the kandra (even though I had it figured out pretty soon). \n \"It moves in larger patterns,\" Vin said quietly. \"Like rivers in the sky. It never just hangs in one place; it floats in the breeze, almost like it makes the breeze.\" \n I loved the mystery around the Lord Ruler and the Well of Ascension. The small excerpts from the books from the Lord Ruler himself and Kwaan were very interesting. Slowly but certainly you discover what happened and is happening to the world. And the ending! Just as with the Final Empire, I literally could not put it down. My heart was pounding from excitement and anticipation. The ending was super intense and I can't wait to pick up the next one, Hero of Ages. This is the conclusion of the trilogy and even though I'm super curious for the ending, I'm gonna be so sad when it's over... \n \"A small figure stood silhouetted by the sun. Black before the red light, a cloak flapped gently on her back. Sazed blinked. The bit of sparkling light he'd seen...it had been a coin. The koloss before him was dead. Vin had returned.\""}

{"text": "Raven's Peak by Lincoln Cole is a fast-paced paranormal action thriller. It was also quite scary in places, and were it a movie with a bit of sound effects, it would definitely be creepy. It is the first instalment in the World on Fire series. \n The novel opens with a lengthy but action-filled prologue where we are introduced to Abigail, a demon hunter, who was out on a mission but had been possessed by the demon she, along with two others, was sent to destroy. Her mentor, Arthur goes to rescue her and is instead taken by the demon after a bone-breaking supernatural fight in a church. \n Though long, the prologue is eventful and exciting. \n \"What stood before Arthur was only the shell of the girl he loved. Something else was in control. He could feel the rage and hatred emanating from Abigail's lithe body. Her skin was covered in a heat rash, her flesh barely containing the demonic presence within.\" \n After the prologue, the novel begins five months after the events at the church, where we meet Haatim, a theology graduate who recently lost his sister to cancer and returned to the US from India, feeling angry at his father and God. He is given a kind of freelance job, by a man named George, to take pictures of Abigail, who is seen following George. \n From there, things progress as Haatim is thrust into the supernatural world of which he had no knowledge. Abigail attempts - at first - to withhold information regarding Haatim's father, who is a member of the Council that sanctions the missions against the demons. \n The duo then flees from otherworldly creatures trying to kill or capture them. Abigail, secretly, tries to find out more about the demon that took Arthur and seeks to save him. \n \"They could feel the supernatural presence, the sheer wrongness of it, as easily as he could. Even the forest could sense something was amiss.\" \n Abigail is tasked to go to Raven's Peak after rumours that there might be a minor demon in the area. From there, things take a whole new level of surprising and scary for both the demon hunter and Haatim. \n Character development in the novel is significant for both Abigail and Haatim. Abigail is also a sarcastic though often serious character, making her interactions with Haatim quite funny, especially since he is new to the whole supernatural scene. \n \"I thought you said I wasn't worth anything to them without the pictures.\" \n \"I didn't think you were,\" she said. \"Turns out, you're worth a whole hell of a lot.\" \n Raven's Peak had many scary parts, some nearly had me biting my nails with suspense, but overall it wasn't horrifying. The pace is very quick, even the longer chapters slip by and you're hungry for more. \n \"What happens when I don't come back? When I become the new threat and you have no one else to send?\" \n Overall rating: 4.5 stars. \n Note: I received a free copy of Raven's Peak from the author in exchange for an honest review (which was originally planned in October.)"}
{"text": "4th&up. \n Add a star if you're a preteen \n If you read and loved the Percy Jackson series, especially the first book, The Lightning Thief, this story might sound a bit familiar to you. Carter and Sadie find out that powerful gods inhabit the real world and these formally ordinary kids discover that they have a vital role to play when it comes to maintaining balance between the humans and the gods. \n So, the story is a bit derivative and definitely patterned after the Percy Jackson series, but it is a damn good formula that Riordan is following- so considering the action, the appealing main characters, the interesting Egyptian mythology (though not as compelling as Greek mythology IMHO) and bits of humor, this book should still be a solid hit with young readers. \n (I could have done without the baboons- but, hey, that's probably just me)."}

{"text": "Sixteen year old Sophie Bloom is an ordinary girl. She has two BFF's, Hannah and Theo, and a bully--yoga-goddess-Bethany, and a mother who mostly can't be bothered, which is why she lives at her Vancouver boarding school. \n On Halloween Sophie pulls a laxative prank on the vile Bethany, then sneaks out to ruin Bethany's rendezvous with a mysterious boy, Kai. If only high school hijinks were so simple. Sophie does meet Kai, but instead of humiliating Bethany, the kiss Sophie receives triggers an onslaught of memories from her prior life--as Persephone, goddess of Spring and Fertility. Turns out Kai is really Kyrillos, son of Hades, and Persephone's jilted ex. \n Kai's about to reclaim his long-lost love when Theo--who is really Prometheus--intercedes, dragging Sophie back to the school grounds. \n Kai enrolls himself in the school--that's the only way he can get near Sophie/Persephone thanks to Theo's magical wards--but Sophie's not really that keen on him. I mean, he's gorgeous but Sophie's concerned that Kai only wants her for Persephone--and she can't even remember that life. Of course, Bethany's on a mission to win Kai for herself, and the spite is quintessential Mean Girl. \n Yeah, and you thought your high school romances were complicated! \n Classmate Cassie spouts earth-shattering prophesy only Persephone can avert--by hooking up with Kai--cementing the weird-factor. Oh, and Sophie develops defensive magic of her own, which is great now that Hades and Zeus have sent their lightning and fireball wielding minions to destroy her. \n Desperate to reclaim her inner Persephone, Theo takes Sophie to the Underworld to find her magical sapphire--a gift from Persephone's mother, Demeter. While there they are framed for poisoning Hades and barely escape. And, upon their return, they learn that Cassie and Bethany have gone missing--vanished by the new guidance counselor. \n Sophie, Kai, Theo and Hannah brave the labyrinth to rescue Cassie from her dragon captor (oh, and Bethany, too, if it works out, you know) forcing previous foes to become allies. It's a dangerous mission, and may be the end of all things humanity if they fail. \n Homerun, Tellulah Darling! \n This YA paranormal romance is a total hoot. The voice: teen-angst-plus-Greek-god-ennui makes for an acidic, deadpan wit that rides roughshod over all those weepy-weepy-poor-me coming-of-age tales. From the first I was struck with laughter. I was totally endeared to Sophie--all she wants is to be loved for her self without, you know, looking like she wants to be loved at all. Because, for a lot of teens, trying to be anything is trying too hard, and hence, so not cool. The puns are merciless--EX FROM HELL?--take it literally."}

{"text": "No, Just no. \n To be fair to anyone who sees this 1 star review, I didn't actually finish reading this book. Truth is, I couldn't. I tried, maybe like 4 times. I just couldn't do it, so I \"threw in the towel\" and gave up. \n After finishing the first book, I couldn't wait until the second one came out. That ending?! Anyone who read the first can agree with me on this one, that was on hell of a cliff-hanger ending. So as soon as I downloaded Predestined I was all about it. Well, I made it to, I'll say 20%, on my Kindle until I put it down. Right now its at 54% and that's where it will stay. \n I really can't pin-point the reason why I can't finish this book. I just can't get into it. I hate Pagan's voice. The plot is not bad, but the story sucks....does that make sense?! (It makes sense in my head) Now that I think back, I don't think I really liked the first one's storyline either. \n Well, bottom line, I can't get interested in this story therefore I will not be finishing.

This new life is strange, though not as strange as Raille--who has healing powers she swore to her mother she would never reveal. \n In this new home, however, people expect that she has her mother's gifts. At least, her mother's former husband does. \n While Raille strives to build a new life for herself she becomes involved with Kyle, the school's resident hottie. Part of Raille's power allows her to sense the illness in those around her. Small diseases or injuries can be healed without much effort, but a serious or life-threatening condition will steal her strength, and results in misfortune for someone close to her--which is why she uses her power sparingly. \n Her relationship with Kyle is threatened by the discovery that Raille's grandmother botched a healing attempt on his mother--leaving her erratic and abusive. Still, he recognizes that Raille's power is real--and in time Raille is able to heal the wounds her grandmother caused. \n In fact, Raille's healing skill seems to progress to the point where there are no secondary ill effects. So much so that she agrees to heal her niece's inoperable brain tumors. Behind this, Raille learns the secret plot that brought her to her new home and discovers her mother's killer. \n The healing takes a dangerous turn, however, and soon Raille must find her own father--a man she has never met--in order to save herself from harm. \n This book ends on a very serious cliffhanger. It started rather slow and the build up to revealing Raille's power seemed overlong. It was well-written and will likely appeal to YA readers."}

From Gwyn and Augus's first meeting in Deeper into the Woods to their later altercation and slow-building romance in Game Theory up to when it all finally culminates in a very intense, very satisfying finale in The Court of Five Thrones. \n This is clearly something that should be paid for. I'm so confused as to why this is free but I've never felt more lucky than this. Seriously. The writing is of high quality. The twists come when you least expect them to - as do the betrayals. Seriously, my heart still aches for Mikken The characters are fleshed out so thoroughly that I felt myself wincing everytime something bad happen to them - as if they existed in real life.

I loved the setting, the descriptions, Alfred, Stephen, Benjamin. And the intrigue... I thought I was in for a trip full of mystery and intrigue. But as the story progressed, I started to lose interest. The narration is in third person, and we get to know most of the plot and the lies and betrayals way before the characters, making it irritating most of the time. There were no surprises, nothing really to make me jump or keep me hooked. \n The ending was really sad, and I was left feeling like there were no wins, only loss.

Is he doomed to be a beast the rest of his life, yanked on a chain held by heartless Shelby? \n I liked the resolution of this story much more than the beginning, which held a few inconsistencies. Allyse is a sweet gal with lots of insecurities, about her body image and her witchcraft skills. Soren is a solid guy who wants a real love, one who shares his whole life, even as a werewolf. His predicament is a little melodramatic, but he bears it well. This is a breeze of a read to wile away a cool afternoon."}
{"text": "I completely take back anything I ever said about the \"Circle\" books being for younger readers than Tammy's Tortall books. There's no sex in this one, but drugs and bloody, \"on-screen\" violence are major plot elements. \n Set four years after the first series, the four young mages have parted company, three of them leaving Winding Circle Temple with their teachers to travel and learn more about the world. Sandry has stayed behind to look after her uncle, Duke Vedris, who has recently suffered a heart attack. \n The story contains two plotlines: The primary plot involves the murders of a family of merchants, while the secondary plot deals with Sandry's discovery of a young mage, Pasco Acalon, whose magic manifests itself through dance. As his discoverer, Sandry is required to teach the boy the rudiments of magic, at the same time that she attempts to assist the Provost's Guard in tracking down the assassins and the mage who helps them. Pasco doesn't take part in the primary plot until the very end of the book, and when he does, he is more of a tool than a character thinking and acting for himself. \n The first time I read this book, I was bored by it, and now I am not sure why. The only reason I can think is that, once again, Tammy has departed from familiar territory, and only the characters of Sandry, the Duke and Lark carry over from the previous series. The other members of the Circle are mentioned, but not seen or heard from at all. The story also takes place over the space of about a week. Still, not a bad story, and I am actually looking forward to reading the next one, which I've never opened before."}

Victoria Schwab is a creative literary genius and I cant wait to dive deeper into her mind by reading the rests of her books. The Archived was beautifully written with such real characters. I was hooked from the first chapter, and although I have to admit my attention wavered somewhere after chapter 4 for a little while.. it still picked up pretty dang quick. Honestly, if it wasn't for my busy school schedule I could've finished this in one sitting. It's that good. Also, I just adore the world building and this notion that our world is actually 3 separate worlds and the whole idea of this story is just brilliant. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text": "The only problem I have with this book is that its author hoped to have the next one out in 2006...here we are in 2011 and it may be coming out soon? How much longer will we have to wait for the next one after that and the next one after that??? Will I be sixty-three before I get to finish the series? Will I have to get a life in the meantime? Oh the horror!"}
{"text": "Undeadly is a fun, fast read and I will probably seek out the next one in the series. Molly Bartolucci goes to school and works part-time in her Dad's business patching up broken zombies. Yes, zombies are part of this society. Apparently you can keep your dead ones sort of alive. Just don't forget to feed them or they might eat you. Molly is looking forward to getting her first kiss from the school hunk, Rick, at her 16th birthday party. The kiss is everything she had hoped for but is followed by a disaster. Rick falls, hits his head on the fireplace, and dies. Molly brings him back to life (mostly) using a talent that she didn't realize she possessed. This gets the attention of a reaper named Rath who was there to collect Rick's soul and help it on it's journey. After he realizes that Molly not only changed fate but is able to actually see Rath, things really get interesting. Molly ends up going to a special school to develop her abilities. The story also incorporates elements of Egyptian mythology - specifically the god of the underworld, Anubis. Although this is obviously a young adult novel, the author does not talk down to her audience and I enjoyed the book."}

{"text": "There was a lot of hype around this book. Perhaps I took it too seriously. I will compare this book to a pot of water, sitting on an old gas stove as it waits to boil. You know it will turn into food eventually, but you're not sure what kind. Mac and sheese,spaghetti, hard boiled eggs, mashed potatoes . . . \n So you set about watching the author cook this dish and you are waiting, waiting, waiting for the water to boil. The author/cook describes everything about the water and the pot. We know the filtered water inside came from the refrigerator. We know the pot has a dent in it because someone dropped it on the floor. We're even keenly aware of the silver edging of the pot as the author goes on about how the non-stick black surface isn't necessary in that particular spot. \n The descriptions are beautiful, accurate, sometimes even deep. The author/cook has a captivating way of telling you how he's cooking his food. \n \"Perhaps it began there,\" he says on page six hundred and something, for about the second or third time. The story is 722 pages long so you can imagine what I thought when he used this phrase so close to the end. \n The dialogue was clever, the insights in the book well done, Rothfuss has a gift for using analogies. I absolutely understand why people love this book . . . but for me, after 722 pages of watching tiny bubbles form at the bottom of a non-stick sauce pan, I put the book down and immediately said two things: (1) \"That was it?\" and(2) \"What was the plot?\""}
{"text": "When i read Patrick's apology about this book I understood why he wrote it. \n The slow regard doesn't continue the story of the Kingkiller Chronicles, it's not a connective short story, and i'm happy of that fact. \n He clearly states this was something he wrote for himself, that he felt needed to be written and thought would forever be a trunk book. \n Auri has always intrigued my and being immersed into her thoughts and the world she lives in where everything has it's place and it's own sort of consciousness was pure magic. \n Don't go into this book expecting to read an excerpt from the next installment, open this book with an open mind and just experience the beauty of the world he created. \n Don't listen to the haters Patrick, if one person picked up that book and found it meaningful than you can be proud of that. \n The slow regard inspired me; i wrote, i drew, i re-read it twice more. \n it's now one of my favourite books. \n http://www.quickmeme.com/img/56/5633a..."}

{"text": "I received a copy of this book via Goodreads's Don't Buy My Love program in exchange for an honest review. There are some spoilers. \n This story centers on the few meager survivors of a catastrophic asteroid collision that occurs near the US west coast. This story is centered in Phoenix AZ. The main characters: Elliot and Adam are two twenty-ish men. Elliot is out and proud gay, Adam has just left a committed relationship with a woman, Jena, for whom he had no romantic inclination because he was closeted gay. \n While stumbling through the barren and buckled remains of his neighborhood, Elliot happens upon Adam. They are overjoyed to find they are not alone. Earthquakes continue to rock the terrain and they seeks shelter together. They also become intimate within hours of meeting--which felt contrived and unrealistic. \n They struggle to find more survivors, mainly because Elliot becomes injured and they go to the virtually empty hospital to seek medicine--again totally unreasonable that there are no emergency response measures or staff. Or even patients. I mean, virtually no one had time to evacuate, because the world government alliance (perhaps) collectively hid the imminent collision of the asteroid from the public until days before it was due to occur. (I cannot stress the inconceivability of this happening what with our 24/7 global news culture.) \n While scouring the remains of a grocery store, Adam and Elliot learn of Refuge Inc., a place for survivors to gather for supplies and shelter. Adam wants to find this place--somehow thinking he might find his ex-fiance, but Elliot is suspicious. They do find the place, with the unwilling help of Anita and her friend, two survivors who assist Elliot to rescue Adam when he gets trapped by falling debris. \n Now at the Refuge, Adam and Elliot are separated. They decide to cool their relationship until Adam can come to terms with his sexuality. Of course, this is complicated by Elliot being arrested for disruptive behavior and the appearance of Jena, Adam's ex, who also claims to be pregnant. \n Elliot meets Mason, an architect of the Refuge, while imprisoned. Mason knows the Refuge is a sinister place--and he's a sinister guy. He convinces Elliot and Adam to spring him from prison--and from the Refuge. Realizing that the projected YEARS of solar blackout are a gross exaggeration of the reality, Adam and Elliot assist Mason--and they escape, though not without casualties. \n On their own, Adam and Elliot are set upon by scavengers. In order to keep these marauders at bay--and to broadcast a message for rescuers--Adam and Elliot agree to lead them to the Refuge--where they can find food and medical supplies, as well as access to a radio transmitter. They plan to break in, but when they arrive, they find the Refuge largely abandoned. That's not to say empty--there are plenty of menacing humans and creatures within its underground bunkers. Mason is now in charge, but he's clearly deranged and poses a specific threat to the band of survivors. \n With great risk, they find the radio and transmit their call for help, but they are attacked and lose some of their ranks. There is an HEA, but it's not the end of the story... \n In truth, I would have stopped reading after the first 50 pages if I hadn't committed to read the whole book and write a review. The scientific facts on which this story is predicated are completely erroneous. That a gathering of perhaps 200 people in a city of 1.5 million survived earthquakes that rocked the area is such a ridiculous notion I couldn't wrap my brain around it. This wasn't a nuclear holocaust or a catastrophic virus outbreak--it was an earthquake. Lots of people survive earthquakes. That there was no coordinated National Guard/FEMA emergency response or hospital staff was simply too unrealistic to be acceptable. The writing is poor with horrible grammar, spelling and usage--so much so that the entire book needs a thorough line edit. Stat. \n I didn't find the romance at all believable until the end of the book--when Adam and Elliot had learned enough about each other and themselves to be adequate partners to each other. Elliot started out as a very emo, effeminate man who grew up a lot in this survivor hellscape. Adam learned to express his emotions, and accept the love the Elliot offered. \n This didn't work for me, as a romance, or a disaster story."}

{"text": "Let me start with saying that I am a huge fan of this series. I have read it since the start but never have written a review that fully details how I feel. \n I'm not about to do that about all the books. Instead, I will try to stick to this one as best I can. \n This book was just as great as the previous ones. With that said, I did hate the outcome. When I first read the title I got a bad feeling. Pittacus Lore has managed to make every single title relevant in all the books. I expected no less of this one. I was not let down. \n This book, unlike most that are part of a series, is not a filler book. Sure, you get some details here and there and some new information but this book, I believe, is a major step to the final battle. I'm not sure if the next will be the last but it could very well be. I liked the plot and the way the book was structured. I liked the twists as well. \n For the major part, the reader gets exactly what he wants. Suspense, a love story or two, some action, and some bit of what we love from each of the characters we've come to admire and fall head over heels for. Team Nine. Well, just because he's hot really. I do love them all. We also, unfortunately get our hearts wrenched. One line in the book, NO SERIOUSLY! ONE LINE! changes everything and makes it all go to shit. For lack of a better way to put it. The climax is basically the end of the book as usual, leaving us with another cliffhanger. One bigger than ever before. \n I don't want to give away spoilers, honestly. I liked the book but not the consequences of the whole mess that's happening. The end of the synopsis says, \"Lorien will rise.\" Well, by the end, Lorien seems closer to destruction than ever before."}

{"text": "Nessun uomo sceglie il male perche e male, scambia solo per la felicita, per il bene che cerca. \n Amo rileggere i libri che hanno saputo coinvolgermi in maniera particolare, ma se l'autrice di qui sto per parlarvi porta il nome di cassandra Clare, allora non ho bisogno di aggiungere altro. \n Questo fa la Clare: uccide, inganna e non ti da scampo, intrappolata nella magia dei suoi libri. \n Nell'epilogo di \"Citta degli angeli caduti\" l'ennesimo colpo di scena della Clare, ci aveva lasciato con il fiato sospeso e il crudele dubbio sulla fuga di Sebastian con Jace.In questo quinto capitolo gli shadowhunters sono disposti a tutto pur di ritrovare Jace, e porre fine alla malvagita di Sebastian prima fra tutta sua sorella Clary.Passano le settimane e il Conclave non trova nessuna traccia dei due fuggitivi, nessuno riesce a localizzarli sono letteralmente scomparsi nel nulla! \n Le ricerche si smorzano poiche le difese ai confini sono state danneggiate... ritrovare Jace al momento non rientra fra le priorita del conclave.Ma Clary, Izy, Simon, Alec e Magnus e i due licantropi Maya e Jordan, segretamente cercano di raccoglie indizi, persino interpellando e scendendo a patti con la regina della corte Selie. \n Perche non appena Jace torna da Clary, dato che non riesce a starle lontano, lei si accorge subito che non si tratta del suo Jace! \n Devono trovare il modo di liberare Jace dall'influenza demoniaca che Sebastian esercita su d lui, perche la sua anima e intrappolata in un corpo assolutamente ai suoi comandi!! \n \"Faresti qualsiasi cosa per salvarlo. A ogni costo, non importa quanto tu debba pagare all'inferno o al paradiso\". \n Questo sentimento tenace e bellissimo che Clary e Jace condividono sara l'unica certezza nelle mani di Clary. L'unica luce che puo rischiarare le tenebre che avvolgono l'anima di Jace. \n Mai come in questo capitolo tutti i personaggi, e fra tutti Simon il vampiro diurno che possiede il marchio di Caino, ricoprono un ruolo fondamentale e determinante nella storia; proprio Simon per la grande amicizia verso Clary e la gratitudine per Jace, compie un gesto di assoluto altruismo per trovare l'oggetto che liberera Jace. \n Sebastian, degno figlio di Valentine e di Lilith, e molto abile a tenere le fila degli eventi e a celare la sua natura mostrando un lato di se nuovo: vero o presunto tale che sia! \n Non mi addentrero oltre nella trama perche ogni capitolo ha una svolta ma porta in se anche altri interrogativi. \n Il finale e come consuetudine della Clare mozzafiato, dove tutto viene mescolato sapientemente in una miscela di azione, adrenalina e sentimenti potenti quanto vari.Non si ha mai la certezza di dove voglia andare a parare... \n Non si puo prevedere quale sia l'esito o la conseguenza di un'avvenimento. \n Ogni personaggio e un universo a se dentro la storia: unico e fondamentale. \n Clary, eroina della serie e degna di essere tale: ragazzina all'oscuro del mondo al quale appartiene dalla nascita, che disconosce i suoi poteri ma che imparera a lottare caparbiamente contro l'oscurita per chi ama e cio in cui crede. In questo 5deg capitolo e ancora messa alla prova perche si trova sola ad affrontare tutto, e deve nascondere il suo dolore e deve cercare di strappare il suo Jace al fratello che lo usa come un sicario marionetta. \n Jace: sempre splendidamente sarcastico e sexy, questa volta si sdoppia letteralmente riuscendo a mantenere in entrambi i casi a mantenere vivo l'interesse verso il suo personaggio. Poiche l'amore che prova per Clary e un perno attorno al quale ruotano tutta la sua vita e le sue certezze! \n Simon: definire questo personaggio magnifico e a mio avviso riduttivo, perche ha avuto uno sviluppo emotivo e caratteriale costante in tutti i capitoli, da nerd antipatico a vampiro caparbio, altruista e affascinante! \n Alec: anche lui questa volta, lontano dal suo parabatai, tira fuori un lato piu caparbio di se, meno disposto a seguire le regole pur di salvare Jace ma compie passi falsi di cui si pentira terribilmente. \n Izzy: intensa e fragile, una ragazza che si mostra con una corazza ma che nasconde un'estrema vulnerabilita. \n Magnus: questa volta lo stregone e uno tra i protagonisti che piu ha catturato la mia attenzione, l'amore cambia irrimediabilmente le persone, le spinge a lottare e mettersi al centro di una battaglia che non gli appartiene pur di salvare la persona che ama! \n Maya e Jordan: i due licantropi sono stati una gran bella scoperta, sensuale direi! \n E dulcis o amaris in fundo... Sebastian: questo personaggio e in assoluto il vero protagonista di citta delle anime perdute, controverso e difficile da decifrare. Tenebroso, spietato eppur fragile nel suo singolare bisogno di essere amato/approvato. L'amore o la sua mancanza, sicuramente possono influire nella mente di un individuo trasformandolo in un essere senza cuore! \n La trama e orchestrata alla perfezione dall'autrice, che convoglia con la sua geniale scrittura ogni emozione e azione in maniera impeccabile. Lo stile e fluido e allo stesso tempo ricco di dettagli e rimandi ai libri precedenti, nonche ai prequel stessi (l'Angelo e il Principe). \n Ogni libro della serie The Mortal Instruments sembra avere in se un fulcro diverso ma che li lega tutti indissolubilmente; solitamente il quinto libro di una serie gia dovrebbe denotare segni di stasi, invece succede proprio l'opposto, l'interesse cresce ogni volta! \n Non mi riferisco solo alla trama che gia di per se e ricca e molto interessante, o ai personaggi ognuno dei quali possiede uno sviluppo caratteriale ed emotivo notevole, ma credo che la Clare sappia rendere possibile un mondo che non esiste e descrivere qualcosa di immaginario come reale! \n Cara Cassandra ti meriti un bel full di stelle goodread!"}
{"text": "5 stars \n Yes I'm late to the party but better late than never, right? And now I can understand why this series is so well loved by people. \n The start of the book was a little slow for me, but world building takes time, and there's still lots more to learn about the PsyNet and the changelings. What took center stage in the book was the romance between Sascha and Lucas, and that was the biggest highlight for me. \n Sascha Duncan is a cardinal Psy. The Psy people have erased ALL emotions over time, so they never feel hurt, jealous, anger, sad, happy, or love. They're basically an unfeeling, cold race of beings. Sascha, however, was the exception, she craved a sense of belonging, loving and being loved in return. They say to feel any of these or other emotions make you flawed, and this flaw could be the death of you when they find out and send you into the rehabilitation center. Sascha has to put on a front or a mask to hide what she feels and these feelings have also caused confusion in her. Especially when she's working together with the DarkRiver alpha leader Lucas Hunter. Lucas recognizes something in Sascha, though he doesn't know exactly what. In their dreams, they share a great passion, and once Lucas discover what's really within Sascha, this passion bloomed. \n That's exactly what I loved about this book. It is romance-centered around these two characters, and what they discover with each other, which was beautifully written. Needless to say, I was very happy with the outcome. \n The other aspect of the plot was also intriguing as Lucas and his people, along with the SnowDancers try to find who has been killing their own people. The power of the mind and how they're connected from people to people and race to race gave the book a sense of newness. The concept is not something I've read before so that was refreshing. The secondary characters in the DarkRiver pack and SnowDancer pack have piqued my interest as well so I'm looking forward to more with them. \n Coming into a new series, I love that there's so much to discover still, and I feel like a kid in a candy store, and this treat must be savored. So hopefully I can pace myself and not indulge too much all at once and take time to enjoy it!"}

I know the point had to be driven home, but it was almost exhausting."}
{"text": "This book was a refreshing, especially its plot; something I haven't read and I liked it a lot. It held my attention throughout the whole book because I wanted to know what's behind all the secrets. I wanted to know what Lexia's dad knew and didn't tell her, why she's so different and what the big deal with her mother really was. \n The author did a great job keeping the reader entertained; it had some pretty steamy scenes in it but the PRN factor was more present, which I loved! She put some great twists and action pact scenes in it and I couldn't stop reading. \n Introducing Lincoln, the hot Black Panther, was a great mix-up. I loved his character a lot and he made the book even more interesting, reading his pov gave me a better idea why he 'hates' hunters...and also why he couldn't hate lexia. \n The ending was a bit strange and I was shocked it ended this way...I just hope it was all for the show and Linc is ok, otherwise I won't read the 2nd book. \n If I'm right, then I'm SOOOOO READING BOOK 2 !! The author did really a great job writing a PRN book with an interesting new plot idea that sucks the reader right in. \n If you're a PNR lover like me, you def will like this book a lot!!"}

There is so much time taken to establish the characters and the background. The retelling of Beauty and the Beast doesn't start until about half way through and by that time I was thinking ok, when are we going to get the actual story started. I just wish that Belle's return to the Beast and their marriage could have been expanded. It would have been nice to get to know Gaspard as a person rather than just as the Beast. But overall, a nice little story."}

When she hears of a strange world called Earth, her questioning nature won't stop until she knows what this \"Earth\" is all about. Finding her way there is easy but finding her way back home is nearly impossible and life becomes a new danger every second. \n I think that Sara Daniell has invented an ingenious plot with a cast of very likable characters. Orion is the tough girl who does things by her own rules. Through her rough exterior though she is extremely likable. Her friend Sage is the wonderful comic relief that keeps Orion grounded. Add in Plath, the hunter from the Sphere. He is simply a killer with a heart. The novel is fast-paced with non-stop action. The ending I did not see coming and it definitely makes me eager for the next book in the series."}
{"text": "The third book in the series, this is quite an entertaining story - quick moving and lots of humour. \n Thomas sees Micah, knows he's destined to be his mate but has to save him from the bullies first. He steps up in protective mode, placing himself between the smaller, delicate Micah and the men who are taunting him. He doesn't hold back in proclaiming his attraction to Micah and demanding respect at which point the bullies are surprised to learn he is gay. \n \"You're a fag?\" \n \"Oh please, you need to be more politically correct when insulting someone. Don't you ever read the papers? We're progressive. We prefer the term pussy challenged. Now, get with the program, boys. My lunch date is waiting.\" \n Thomas uses his wit and humour to defuse the situation only to find that Micah has left but not before leaving him a pink rose and a note. (Luckily Micah had a rose handy!) \n As per the other books, sizzling hot sex without much buildup - cause when you know the guy is your mate you just go for it - instinct just demands sex and claiming! \n There is another incident where Thomas need to protect Micah. This time he needs to use his special skills so makes Micah close his eyes while he deals with the bad guys. Finally he resorts to calling in the pack's \"clean up\" crew to help him and Micah get away. Unfortunately Micah overhears some of his conversation - he must have had good hearing to overhear both sides of the conversation. \"What did Jake mean by shifting? Into what? A werewolf? Really?\" It's quite funny to watch he reaction to finding out this pretty momentous news but just seems to accept it, more annoyed about the lying rather than the actual werewolf thing. \"Okay, it is a little weird, I think I already said that, but we all have our idiosyncrasies. Yours just seem to be a little stranger than most. So what? It still doesn't change the fact that you lied to me.\" \n The local pack is dispatched to the scene to help out and the Alpha just happens to be Micah's other mate and claims him before Thomas becomes aware. This leads into the bulk of the story - the challenges of being a threesome, the tri-omega complexities & secrets from Micah's past. \n I did find Caleb not very appealing when he first joins the story and at times Micah was a little annoying (referred to a spunkiness in the book). Thomas is just supportive and nice and all too kind. \n There were a few things that I didn't quite grasp or thought weren't well explained - Micah just leaving his old life behind, Micah's parent's behaviour, some lack of observation about Micah's physical appearance How did Thomas and Caleb not notice his scars given they were all so physical? - but I just accepted the story for what was presented. \n Overall, perfect book if you like a cute story filled with lots of humour and lots of very well written sex scenes! \n Favourite quotes: \n \"It wasn't easy being werewolf and gay. Everyone wanted you to have cubs. The more cubs you had, the more pack members. The more pack members there were, the stronger the pack - yada, yada, yada.\" \n \"We never had a first date, or a second one. We've never even had a date. We just went from hello to bed. And now I find out you're a werewolf?\" \n \"Yes, I'm housebroken.\" \n \"Don't you Micah me, fur ball.\" \n \"I'm not real sure how this whole greeting thing works, but if you're going to try to sniff my ass I expect dinner first.\" \n 3.5 stars \n I now publish all my m/m reviews on my blog so if you want to see all my m/m reviews in one place come visit at Because Two Men Are Better Than One!"}
{"text": "So. This is it. The end of the Blood of Eden series. Wow. What an impeccable ride that was!

A huge surprise happens and hits us with a ton of bricks. Like damn, poor Allison hasn't had a single break. Allison, like in the last book, seems to be even more ruthless with killing and is even stronger. She doesn't stop to get back the boy she loves, kill Sarren and the disease once and for all. Just like the synopsis stated, the final hunt is on, and Sarren better run from Allison's wielding katana. \n Jackal still cracks me up in this book, and he never ceases to surprise me. He shows a more compassionate side in this, NOT TO GET CONFUSED: He isn't nice, he isn't caring, he IS however an asshole and he definitely doesn't care if Allison, Zeke or even Kanin dies, but he DOES try to save Allison in some parts. He does surprise us at the end as well, and it was a pleasant surprise indeed. Whenever it comes to Jackal, I feel like it is my duty to share a quote because he's just way too funny, so here it is: \n \"Oh, isn't that sweet,\" came Jackal's loud, mocking voice... \"Let's make goo-goo eyes at each other in the middle of a stinking corpse field, how very romantic.\" \n The ending was so fast coming and I was not ready for that. Something happens that I still can't comprehend why it had to happen. WHY KAGAWA WHY. I remember crying and crying through the end till the last page. Kagawa definitely knows how to write a friggan great and dramatic finale. Don't expect to be happy at the end as well, even though I don't know how anyone could be, considering this amazing world is coming to a close. \n Stakes are high, Eden is about to become infected, heartbreaking decisions are made, and sacrifices will happen to save humanity and vampires together. \n This will be missed. Goodbye Allison. Goodbye Kanin. Goodbye Jackal. Goodbye Zeke and finally, Goodbye Blood of Eden. \n IF you liked this review, check out more of the series I did on my blog, as well as other YA reviews. \n http://keepcalmandloveboooks.blogspot.ca"}
{"text": "3.5 stars \n I really liked the first book of this series and I overall really liked this one but it dragged for a good 1/3 of the book... I don't know why for sure. Part of why it dragged was because I wasn't sure I liked how far she was going from one of the main character in the first book. Once I decided I really liked where the plot was going, it just still seemed like there was too much detail. It just needed to be condensed a bit. It felt like a 500 page long book or more although I don't really know how long it was because I read it in e format. Anyways it dragged a but but I really enjoyed the first 1/3 and the last 1/3 of the book and I liked what was in the middle 1/3 if it had just been condensed. \n *does contain a few sex scenes"}

{"text": "I'm not impressed :("}
{"text": "What I found so refreshing about this read is how unique the voice and the premise of the plot is. The language is very powerful and lots of the lines are almost poetic. This author is very talented at really packing a lot of punch into almost every sentence. The words are beautifully crafted, the editing is absolute perfection, the descriptions are just enough to let the reader see it, without being overboard to the point where they bog down the pace. \n There were no sections that I wanted to skim. \n If I was going to complain about anything, it would be to say that while the author's voice is very unique, none of the characters are very distinct. Each is snarky, witty, and a bit crass. And I loved every minute. \n Gavin is a fantastic and dreamy hero, though I would have liked to have seen more of him."}
{"text": "See full review for Eclipse at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n The last time I read this book, it was the summer before my senior year of high school. I had read Eclipse the summer before when it was first released, but I was rereading it in preparation for the series finale that was coming out in August. Almost a decade later, and this book still irks me a little bit. Mostly because of the love triangle, but now also because of a few other things as well. First, let's examine the new love triangle. As expected, Jacob becomes a new side because of everything he did for Bella while Edward was 'away.' Edward only barely tolerates him because of everything he did for her, but he still tries to keep the two apart, which was quite annoying. The whole dismantling of Bella's car and then having Alice 'kidnap' her when he goes hunting just so that she doesn't go to the reservation pissed me off. Talk about controlling. But he does eventually relent when he realizes that Jacob wants to protect her as much as he does."}
{"text": "Not great but not terrible. More info on the Set Mutation would have helped. Saw the big reveal coming a mile away. More world building was definitely needed."}
{"text": "**4.5 Stars ** Why did I have to read this book so quickly?! I didn't want it to end! This is definitely a light read, but who doesn't need those every once in awhile. I'm never sure how I feel about sequels to books I enjoy - the disappointment you feel when they don't live-up to the expectations you set. This is not one of those books. I'm not sure that I would have enjoyed it so much had I not read Garden Spells - so if you haven't, I'd read that first. If you're looking for a little light magic, love to savor/dream about food, and enjoy seeing the extraordinary things in the ordinary, this is a book for you. \n There's even a recipe for Fig and Pepper Bread at the end - I can't wait to try it :)"}
{"text": "See full review for Every Last Breath at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n The last we left Layla, she had just been attacked and imprisoned by the Wardens. Roth and Cayman got her out and were able to heal her lethal wounds at a cost. While recovering she discovered that a Lilin had been made and had taken over her best friend Sam's body. When book 3 begins, Layla is confronting Sam/Lilin and he explains how he came to take over the body. She is pissed and changes into her Warden form, but something is different about her because the Lilin turns tail and runs. When she looks at her friends, they tell her that she should look in the mirror, because something about her transformation has changed. She now has feathers on her wings, and something else has changed about her because now even Upper Level demons are running from her in fear. \n That's not the worst of her problems either. Because of the Lilin's appearance, the Alphas have appeared and after calling her an abomination and trying to off her, they tell the Wardens that if something isn't done about the Lilin by them then THEY will have to take care of it, which will cause a huge war. Like apocalypse level. No pressure. So, now Layla has to destroy the Lilin before its too late and somewhere along the line she has to save Sam's soul too so that way he doesn't end in Hell for an eternity. \n Oh, jeez, I don't even know where to begin with this book. Like the last one it sent me on an emotional roller coaster that I'm still recovering from."}

{"text": "Ahh, the last book in the Precious Stone Trilogy... so sad. I did not want to see this series end but unfortunately, it was time to wrap things up and call it quits. After all, we needed to find who the real culprit was right? \n It was definitely sad to say goodbye to Gwen and her quick wit and also Xemerius! Boo! He literally made the books so funny and not all dramatic at times. Again, I will say that the romance portion was lacking and I felt no connection between Gideon and Gwen. The only time I didn't particularly like Gwen, was when she was obsessing over Gideon and not getting her priorities straight. With that being said, Xemerius did stop the whining of lovers scorned at most times and fixed her priorities. I don't want to give too much away so I can't necessarily talk about the plot considering this book was dedicated to solving all of the problems and mysteries. \n BUT. CAN I JUST TEASE YOU GUYS ABOUT THAT ENDING? LIKE DAMN. I was not expecting that at all. I loved that surprise because then everything starting clicking into place, in my mind. I will say that the whole book was kind of lacking in exciting plot twists. Having read the whole novel, the book was all leading up to the big finale, which many were disappointed in. I can see their P.O.Vs for sure, but I just loved this series so much I couldn't not like it, especially the end! \n I always hate reading the last books in any series because I can't seem to let go no matter what! I mean, I still reread this books from time to time. \n IF you liked this review, check out more on my blog where I review YA and other genre books! \n http://keepcalmandloveboooks.blogspot.ca"}
{"text": "A solid ending. I can see why kids love the series, though I still contend that it doesn't hold a candle to my dear Mr. Potter. \n The best part of the series is how I usually didn't see things coming.

{"text": "\"I love you. Always. Beyond death.\" \n I thought I've seen it all, read everything what could/would possibly happen to one of my favorite book couples. I thought I was prepared to experience the final installment. After nine full length novels and several novellas I truly believed nothing can shock me or crush me....well guess who was wrong?! Yup, me, like 100% wrong. This last book was everything I hoped it would be. It evoked so many emotions in me that I really considered to open and drink a bottle (NOT just a glass) of wine at noon to help me get through it. All her books made me feel but this last book, smh, made me cry bittersweet tears. It took 9 books to make me bawl my eyes out...yeah Karina is that good. \n Emotions...so so many emotions rushed through my body that I couldn't ponder or enjoy one emotion too long because a new feeling pushed its way into my mind and in my heart. \n Karina made my heart bleed and bloom with the purity of Dex and Perry's love devotions: \n \"I couldn't lose him. I wouldn't.\" \n \"I love you absolutely, resolutely. There is no question, no doubt. This love just is.\" \n \"I love you! Always have, always will. Always!\" \n Karina also scared the bejesus out of me. Like I said I thought I've seen and read it all. I mean come on, after nine books you naturally assume that, right?!? RIGHT?!! Oh boy was I wrong. It was as if she upgraded her \"I scare the heck out of my readers\" -mood. So here I was sitting in broad daylight, goosebumps all over my body, because (good bless her vivid imagination) she pulled me in in Perry and Dex's darkest most cruelest moments. I felt their sorrow, pain, angst, desperation... GAAH just everything. I was scared beyond for both!! \n \"His eyes were dark pools that had no depth, no sign that made the man had no empathy at all - or that he was even a man.\" \n \"...I didn't sense his beautiful soul. I sensed nothingness, foul and black and endless, a gateway to a world I prayed I'd never see.\" \n I don't know how she's doing it but everything felt so realistic; the stuff she comes up with haunts you, too, not just Perry and Dex. Karina has this ability to create the perfect setting, tagging her readers along, keeping the illusion alive - an illusion that either scares the heck out of you, or makes you feel in all the right and wrong places. It was a constant up and down with my emotions; I was calm and relaxed one minute, allowing to think \"all will be ok now\", and in the next my heart was beating so fast and hard trying to jump out of my rip cage. Yeah my emotions and overall well-being took a toll while reading this book! \n Dust to Dust is packed with everything we came to love in Karina's EiT books - horror, angst, lust, love and supernatural creatures perfectly wrapped up in a all consuming plot that glues you to your e-reader. Even after all these books she still managed to top it off, mesmerizing me, her readers, by following Perry and Dex's last adventure. This series holds a special place in my heart and ever will!! This book was everything I wished it would be... \n *** 5 Love Beyond Death Stars *** \n Note: If you're new to this series, book 1, DARKHOUSE is for free on Amazon! In my opinion, Darkhouse is like the introductory book -it's a bit slower then the rest of her books but you get a great picture who Perry is and how she met Dex. Even though her books are labeled as Horror and Supernatural, keep in mind that it also has a slow building love story in it. Dex and Perry experience so much, grow closer together due to a 'special bond' that it was pure bliss to follow them how they fell for another, bit by bit, more and more, in every book. They literally don't just face supernatural barriers in the books but emotional ones too. And yes, the books HAVE to be read in order, otherwise you get lost. \n ___________________________________ \n Read all my review (A-Z) on the blog \n Like the blog on Facebook"}

I can't wait until the next book is out and we can see Tania and Edric marry."}
{"text": "hallelujah!"}
{"text": "Before I even get into my review of this book, I should explain my past with this series. I first tried getting into the Shadows of the Apt series when book one, \"Empire in Black and Gold,\" came out - tried, and failed. I thought the ideas were interesting, but the execution was a little too predictable even for me, and I gave up. I watched as successive novels came out, each one sounding awesome. I even read a few short stories set in this world of the Apt, but I never tried to go back to the full series. \n And then book five fell into my hands. I could still remember the characters and world setting from the first book, but would that be enough for me to get through \"The Scarab Path\"? Just barely, and now I know I've missed out on some awesome reading. Comparing book one to book five, it's easy to see Tchaikovsky's growth and maturation as a writer. The action scenes are well paced, and there are plenty of them. But this isn't just an excuse to chronicle some series of RPG born campaigns - there is no want on violence, and every scene serves to further the plot. \n The only drawback of this novel is that it doesn't work as a stand alone story. If you've only read the back covers of the other four in the series, you know about the rise of the Wasp empire, and how by the end of book four the Wasps were halted, at least for now. In that respect, this novel is a new direction for the series. But without at least a basic familiarity of the cast involved, the Scarab Path would be confusing to navigate. Many names are just casually referred to, even when critical to the plot. In this novel we bring back Che and Thalric as our principal view point characters, with a mix of new and old supporting cast to round out the story narration. The story is set in the distant city of Khanaphes, a city consigned to myth where a strange kinden of beetles live their lives according to the laws of their mysteriously absent Masters. Che is there to find answers to the confusing questions she was left with at the end of the last book. And where Che goes, others will follow, all suspecting secret strategy in her visit to such a remote corner of the Nem desert. \n \"The Scarab Path\" was a good read that kept me up late reading often. Its always fun to read a book that is so stock full of high magic (the Art of the Apt can be described no other way) but where the characters are blind to it, seeing only the fantastical of the rare low (Inapt)magic. A wonderful blend of steampunk and epic fantasy, \"The Scarab Path\" makes a good addition to the Shadows of the Apt series."}
{"text": "Up until reading Hunger Games, this was my all-time favorite book. It is still a completely different genre, being entirely fantasy in every way. The author writes so beautifully I could close my eyes and picture everything she described, and the way the tale wove through all three books was perfect. I have read this book over and over again, never tiring of it."}

{"text": "This book is about Celaena Sardothien who is a trained assassin but got caught by Chaol, Captain Westfall. In order to get a freedom, she must represent the prince to death tournament and become King's Champion for 4 years before get her freedom that she really wanted. \n In the tournament, it got several Test to go through before the Final Test. When the tournament begins, something strange happen to the Champion's, they were brutally murdered before each Test begin. Celaena try to figure out what exactly happen and who is the murderer and try to make sure that she's not the next target of murderer. \n It was a great and I really enjoy reading this book even I'm not a person who really enjoy reading that need a high imagination and I find it too difficult to pronounce the name and place in this novel."}
{"text": "I'm torn when it comes to reviewing this book -- a vampire hunter on the TITANIC?! How awesome is that? \n The premise is awesome -- the vampire-slaying heroine hits her head and wakes up in the body of her ancestor, on board the most infamous ship of all time. She shmoozes her way through second class and creates sparks with a handsome young man, all the while dreading the collision and aftermath. The first couple of chapters are particularly promising. Having her know what's coming is a good idea, since it really hammers home the dread. \n Unfortunately, I never emotionally connected with this book -- in part because the romances (there are two of them) are so unrealistic; she meets and falls for Alex in four days (and he falls for her), and then once she returns to present-day, she has an immediate romantic connection with someone she's barely spoken to. The dialogue is also forced -- sometimes painfully so. I wish there had been more about the vampires. I wish we could have interacted with better-known historical figures. I wish there'd been a little more going on than just wandering around the ship and changing for dinner. Props for the idea, but the execution didn't live up to my expectations."}

{"text": "There are some books in the romance genre that are so wrapped up in \"finding love,\" the entire plot seems to revolve around the needs of the two main characters. Even when there's danger involved, these kinds of books tend to be anti-climactic. The man has no purpose without the woman. The woman has no future without the man. They live for each other and apart they are nothing. \n I'm sure some people find this terribly romantic. But I find it depressing. There's more to love than finding someone who fills your personal needs. There's more to love than lust and obsession. There's individuality too. There's the will to take care of yourself and the strength to be alone. \n Yep, I said it. There is no love without the strength to be alone. \n This romance novel was a refreshing change from many of the Young Adult novels I've read in the last year that are high on love triangles, teen angst, and emotional dependency. This romance novel has two strong characters, capable of being alone. There is no melodramatic inner-struggle where the man tries for 100 pages to say he loves the protagonist. There are no chapters dedicated to the obsessive idolization of the leading man. No statements from the protagonist about how she'd rather die than live without him. No place where the main female character just can't decide who she loves more and I, as the reader, just want to smack her senseless. \n No, this is a well-crafted book with two mature leading characters. It is refreshing to read about a man using the \"L\" word on his first attempt. Refreshing to cheer for a woman who understands herself, trusts her instincts, and has the strength to be alone. Not only that, but the plot is amazing. There are pirates. Curses. Werewolves. Ghosts. Sacred Stones. Witches. And an entire cast of strong supporting characters. I couldn't put this book down. It was that good."}
{"text": "4th&up. \n 3.5 stars \n A slightly bizarre children's novel that strikes me as a cross between a Brian Selznick book (one thread told through words, one through pictures) and a Roald Dahl tale (vile and uncaring parents, a spunky and gifted child, and a unique world just waiting to be discovered). \n At times the text is a bit choppy and some elements don't entirely gel, but the illustrations are charming, the plot is unique and I think most readers will happily ignore the inconsistencies and still be pleased with this wonderfully imaginative story."}
{"text": "Darkfall is the final book in the Healing Wars Trilogy. \n When I first started this series I was a little uncertain about how it would pan out. The first book was a little confusing and it was hard to understand how the pain was used and what was really going on. But like all good writers Hardy learned from her mistakes and the last two books were smooth sailing. \n I still stand by the concept of this book is rather unique. The ability to take pain and use it as a weapon or for good just hasn't been brought out to the YA world (as far as I know). \n While I did feel as if this book was a great ending to the series I think there was a part lacking. The romance. Either take it out or leave it in and develop it but it just seemed so forced that it lacked any emotion or feelings from the reading. \n I do think there is another series that could come out of this but if it didn't pan out I'd be okay with that too. I feel the book ended on a good note and it COULD be continued but if not readers won't be disappointed."}

Percy herself starts out a bit thin as a character, but that's because she's purposefully guarded."}
{"text": "Princess Addie and Princess Meryl are sisters and best friends, even though they have very little in common. Meryl wants to be a warrior when she grows up, and slay the monsters that plague their father's kingdom, and find a cure for the plague known as the Gray Death. Addie is afraid of everything, including spiders. She makes her sister promise not to go adventuring until she is safely wed to her true love -- whoever that may be -- so she won't be left alone. But fate takes a hand, and at the age of seventeen, Meryl is struck down by the Gray Death. Her only hope is for sixteen-year-old Addie to find the courage to go on a quest for the cure. I probably would have find the story more interesting and a lot less predictable if I was about ten -- the target audience -- since Addie starts her quest with all kinds of helpful magical gizmos that do exactly what she needs them to at just the right time. The only thing that took my interest was the romantic subplot. Even that sort of strained my suspension of disbelief, but at 31, I have different expectations and ideas about romance than a child would."}
{"text": "BLACKOUT by Robison Wells reminds me of this old joke. \n There are two dyslexics working in a kitchen. One says, \"Can you smell gas?\" And the other says, \"I can't even smell my own name.\" (Remember, it's just a witticism, a spoonerism, if you will. Not necessarily derogatory.) \n BLACKOUT was an entertaining read, fast-paced, intriguing. I guess you could say engaging. I was engaged, then... Well, I think you'll like those characteristics. I haven't read its predecessor if there is one. But after reading it, I feel like one of those kitchen workers. Nonetheless, I don't have dyslexia. There just wasn't enough narrative explanation for my tastes. Maybe if there are successor volumes, I could be more satisfied. But that's speculative. \n Perhaps, I have the worldwide virus that's a premise to what happens in the novel. I finished the whole book, but I didn't learn sufficient information about that virus. Or about the motivation of both the mentioned and unmentioned antagonists in this work. There was not nearly enough knowledge and development for my tastes, other than the virus is totally weird, inexplicably so, and creative. One thing I did learn about the virus was the fact that it only infected youth --- teenagers --- and it made them super- or sub-human. Superpowers. \n (So, because I'm old, I don't have \"that\" virus. Whew! Something's infected me, though. I hope it can be treated.) \n In BLACKOUT the primary players on the dark side, who, of course, are all infected, include Alec, Laura, and Dan. And on the side of light --- after all, they're probably Saints, since they're from central Utah --- are Aubrey and Jack. Or, perhaps, that should be \"on the light side\" --- ha ha. At least, I think that's right, but recall that I might be infected (although not with \"the\" virus). The former trio serve as terrorists, utilizing their viral superpowers to wreak havoc. The nation's military ends up exploiting the later two heroes' superpowers to thwart the villains. These characters are all viewpoint characters, and they're not the only ones, as I recall. Character development suffered. \n You see, this virus shows itself in varying ways, but never with the same symptoms in any two different individuals. It's unlike any other disease or virus known to mankind, at least in my experience. Or in my imagination. And its symptomatic manifestations are all over the place as far as superpowers or darkpowers for these teens go. The antagonists wreak havoc across the United States --- for what purpose is unclear --- and the protagonists are simply manipulated by their government without a satisfactory justification for my tastes in doing so. \n Hence, as in all fantasy and/or pseudoscience fiction, such powers can be and are manipulated in a deus ex machina way. It's very, very convenient. (I read a uncorrected proof.) \n That's how I spell it."}

{"text": "Amazing volume. Correction to some reviews. \n I think this corrects the previous reviews talking about missing stories and pages, and so I say 10 out of 10! \n Firstly, the corrected 2011 edition is a beautiful leather-bound hardback with ridged spine, with beautiful cloth page marker bound into it. Silver edged pages are a nice addition. \n As for the Amazon.co.uk reviews stating it is 'incomplete' - I have gone through all of the other reviews that mention some works of fiction that are missing from this volume so in effect doesn't make it 'complete' in regards to Lovecraft's fiction. See below: \n Wentworth's Day (1957), The Gable Window (1957), and The Horror From The Middle Span (1967) are mentioned as missing but these are not included on the bibliography list on Wikipedia, but are actually written by August Derleth anyway. \n The Thing In The Moonlight, Horror in the Museum, Poetry and the Gods, and In the Walls of Eryx are mentioned as missing, but these are collaborations with notes on the Wikipedia bibliography. \n The Fungi from Yuggoth is mentioned as missing, but this is poetry anyway according to the Wikipedia bibliography. \n The Loved Dead is mentioned as missing but is not listed in the bibliography on Wikipedia and was actually written by C.M. Eddy, Jr. \n The Evil Clergyman is not missing, it is in the contents and features on page 941. \n I have just compared (Dec 27, 2013) the 'fiction' section of the Wikipedia bibliography with all of the stories featured in this volume. All of the fiction is included in this volume. \n It does, however, include Through the Gates of the Silver Key which was in fact a collaboration with E. Hoffman Price, and Under the Pyramids which was a collaboration with Harry Houdini. \n In the volume it says under Juvenilia that The Little Glass Bottle, The Secret Cave, The Mystery of the Grave-Yard, The Mysterious Ship (short and long version), and a discarded draft of The Shadow Over Innsmouth are included. They are. \n In the Juvenilia section of the Wikipedia bibliography it also lists The Alchemist and The Beast in the Cave - these are actually listed under main fiction section in the volume. \n The only thing I have noticed is that under the Juvenilia section of the Wikipedia bibliography is that it lists The Haunted House, John, the Detective, The Noble Eavesdropper, and The Picture. These are not in the volume under main fiction or the Juvenilia appendix - but on Wikipedia is says these are unpublished anyway. \n Reviews have said that 1099 is an 'About the Author' but it only goes up to 1098. Mine only goes up to 1098 but the Index doesn't mention this section anyway and ends as it should to on the last page of Supernatural Horror \n In Literature. \n Again, I repeat, I think this corrects the previous reviews talking about missing stories and pages, and so I say 10 out of 10!"}
{"text": "Jake Mendoza finds a dying dragon who's just given birth. One of her dragonlets is still alive, so despite the laws forbidding it, the 14-yr-old boy adopts the baby and raises her in secret. \n I can appreciate that this was an exercise in style for Robin McKinley, but I think it would appeal more to the audience that liked \"Sunshine\" than the one who liked \"Beauty.\" McKinley seems to have trouble writing as Jake; or perhaps the storyline is simply too bland. Jake does a lot of teenage philosophizing which is at once wise beyond his years and written in the voice of a 12 year old. \n More than once I put the book down thinking I would not finish it. But, let's face it, Robin McKinley is my God even if she's had a couple of misses these past few years. Although Dragonhaven does improve substantially after the first half, it never comes near the precision of characterization or the depth of human feeling that I've learned to expect from McKinley. \n Read Instead: \"The Blue Sword\" or \"A Knot in the Grain\" (collection)"}

{"text": "When I first read the blurb I was a little disappointed that this book wouldn't be about Munro or Christoff. But since I greatly like Thad, I was also curious about his sister and their background story. Thad's sister, Jo, is both strong and vulnerable, a kickass girl and a desperately lonely woman, protective and fierce, an illiterate orphan seeking her own place and someone to share her life with. Unfortunately, this someone turns out to be Rune the Baneblood, the least appealing and most annoying male character in the whole IAD series. The most coveted male who is totally uninvolved and emotionally distanced until he meets his fated one.. The poor victimized and tortured soul, the assassin killing at the whims of others, unwilling to change his habits even for Jo. \n I expected a bit more from this book e.g. Thad's introduction of his sister to Lothaire and some funny dialogue lines, but that didn't happen, though Lothaire has a cameo at the Valhalla fight. There was also not much interaction between Jo and Thad, a little at the start of the book and a little at the end of it. There was instead plenty of repetitive sex stuff, as if KC's recent writing a lot of contemporary eroticas has worsened her intuition about those scenes as they were of worse quality than in her previous IAD books. \n I look foward to the next IAD book, hoping finally for Munro or Christoff story."}
{"text": "Meh. This book took me a while to finish. I was not engaged with these characters anymore. I wanted to see how it ended...pretty good ending. There was too much focus on side characters who I didn't care about. \n This series as a whole would not be one I would read again. \"Vampire Academy\" still takes the cake for me. Each of those books got better & better. This series was best at books 3 & 4. Stretching it to 6 books was a reach for me."}
{"text": "I was really optimistic to read this book because of all the raving reviews and the description was intriguing. I was lucky enough to get a copy through a R2R program offered by one of my GR groups. I would like to thank the author and group for this opportunity. \n Talented is centered around people born with special talents due genetic mutations caused by nuclear contamination. Those who possess talents are tested, and if skilled enough, attend McDonough School for the Talented. Talia is a girl who possesses special powers and has made a personal vow to avenge the murder of her parents by training hard and being the best hunter she can be. \n For the most part, this book kept my attention and was a pleasurable read. There were grammatical errors and some words were missing within sentences. I enjoyed most of the characters, especially the scenes with Talia and her team. I have to admit, however, Talia had a tendency to whine.....a lot. My MC whine tolerance only goes so far. The story got bogged down with the romance at times. I understand this is a paranormal romance, but come on; I need plot & storyline to truly enjoy a book from start to finish. World building was good. We got quite a lot of explanation early on so the story could take off without having to have info dumps every third paragraph. This story contains the dreaded \"love triangle!\" (hahaha) I am not one who loathes all things triangle; as long as it is done well or has twists and/or surprises, I am totally onboard. This one? I guess my answer would be, meh?! I liked that the story didn't focus on Talia's school life, more on training and missions life. It was a nice change from all the \"Boarding School\" stories I seem to be reading lately. \n Overall, this was an easy read and with the cliffhanger ending that piqued my curiosity. Readers who enjoy dystopian stories and/or paranormal romances should definitely check this one out!"}
{"text": "Holy cow \n Let me just say that I have been mulling over how I was going to write this review since I was about halfway done with the book. I decided that I have to separate it into parts. \n Spoiler free \n The writing in this book is phenomenal. I am so blown away just from that that I am going to go ahead and add all of her books to my reading list...despite the fact that it's already long enough. \n I had no idea what was going on at first and thought that I would have to read the previous series in order to understand, but s great job is done in explaining everything along the way and that's what really captivated me about this book! Character development was astounding! For the first time ever I read the book more for the characters than for the plot itself. \n Also, the world that the author has created is something of a masterpiece. Many times, I had the map in order to better understand what she was referring to, but either way, her writing gave way for my imagination to explode in a Big Bang sort of way. \n Spoiler area \n I love all the romances that are booming in this series. Nina is my favorite hands down but I'm secretly rooting for Jesper and Wylan. If that happened I think I would love this author forever...forever more than I do now. \n I'm intrigued about Kaz and Inej because their relationship is very complex and there are so many threads in their life that it's hard to have them combine into one. I do hope that they end up together, though. \n Do when does the second part come out"}
{"text": "See full review for Definitely Dead at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n When the sixth book of the Sookie Stackhouse book begins, she's modeling with her fairy godmother's brother Claude and you start to get the feeling that something happened between Book 5 and 6. How do you know this? Well, Sookie mentions the fact that the Queen of Louisiana and the King of Arkansas got married and that she has already met the Queen when she brought news of her cousin - Hadley - death. Both events play a huge part in Definitely Dead. As I've mentioned before I don't like it when authors write short stories (also called novellas) that play a part in the next book for a series. I already have a long enough reading list, but to add these novellas to them too would just make it that much longer. However, Harris gets a pass because the events in this novella are thoroughly summarized you get the basic gist of what's going on. \n Anyway, Sookie is still dealing with the fallout from her murder of Debbie Pelt and the fact that Eric now knows what happened that night and what happened those few days that he was with her without his memory. Things are strained between the two, which saddens Sookie because she really misses him as a friend. Huh. Debbie Pelt's parents and sister are sniffing around still looking for answers and Sookie has had enough and tries to send them on their merry way. And then there's Quinn, the were-tiger who took an interest in our blonde haired heroine in the last book. He comes around and asks Sookie on a date and to tell her that the Queen requests her presence at this big meeting of all the vampire rulers next month. \n While out on this date, Sookie and Quinn are attacked by Weres and the following day the Queen's assistant comes by and asks her if she's ready to go to New Orleans to tidy up her cousin's affairs. He sent a messenger, who they find dead in her backyard. It's just another normal week in the life of Sookie Stackhouse."}

{"text": "See full review for Scarlet at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n I have to admit that after all the good things I heard about Scarlet, I was ready to be disappointed because that is usually how it goes for me. Especially with series that are sequels, but really aren't because they introduce new characters without seeing any of the old ones. However, this book is different because it does show me the characters I came to know in Cinder while also introducing new ones and having all their paths somewhat intersect. I liked Scarlet's character - she is really no nonsense and will do anything to save her grandmother. Ditto to Captain Thorne who was the comedic relief this book needed when it got to be too serious. Wolf on the other hand...I'm still undecided about him because I'm still trying to figure him out. If I understood this correctly, he is one of those creatures that Levana was working on and had stationed on Earth so that way she could invade it easier? But because he believes Scarlet to be his mate he was able to override his master's wishes? Am I getting that right?"}

{"text": "3.5 stars \n To be Honest, Unravel Me as a Sci-fi Dystopian novel is really enjoyable.It was, although not an entirely unique idea, it was different, intense and exciting. However Unravel Me as a Young adult romance novel was dissapointing to say the least. Reading the sequel to Shatter Me, I was forced to approach it in sections- romance and action.The whole love triangle going on between Adam , Warner and Juliet was tiring and boring. This probably had something to do with the fact that all three of these characters were somewhat underdeveloped unrelateable which is a shame considering they ARE the three main characters!! Juliet played the typical beautiful female character who spends a majority of the book in self pity worrying about her problems. Not until the end did we actually see her 'Do something' and may i mention , that it was also not till the end does 'something' actually starts happenning . Adam's character was cliche underdeveloped . As a love interest he was goodlooking, somewhat protective ..thats it ... .Warner's character wasn't consistant enough, making the transition between the first and second book seem unrealistic. \n On a light note i really enjoyed myself near the end, not so much the actual ending though and i adored Kenji !! sigh if only the other character were as interesting and 'heroic' ( as in he has the charactristics of a good hero- get my gist ) than I would add this to my favourites. \n Note : i loved the prose in the previous book - delicate and unique \n however i found the style in this book to stretch out the story too much to a point that i was skipping page ...... \n ^ bad review i know :'("}

I really liked the scenes with Valerie I thought they were very amazing and I could feel the emotion and just truely gifted writing. However, there were parts that seemed to drag. It was a quick read but it just has so much longing and teenage love/angst that it started to drag. I found that it went fast then slowed really slow then picked up speed the last 100 pages. If that's my only complaint we're still doing good. \n Though I loved it and can't wait till the next book!"}
{"text": "In short; I really disliked this book a lot. \n Do not recommend it to anyone, not even people who enjoyed Twilight for example. \n This book had quite some potential in the beginning. I loved how it was all set up. I loved the palace but it went downhill after the first night she spend in it. For such a defiant and confident girl that should hate vampires, she was rather easily smitten. \n I also disliked how she kept going from 'I accept my death' to 'I like being here' and then to 'I will escape' and right back to the first. \n Other than that she is so stupid. Like one second she realizes how she has to behave in a social sphere and two seconds later she has forgotten about it and gets angry about it. It would have been a more pleasant read if she either stuck to one opinion or slowly changed it and not kept running in circles. Example: She goes to town with Prince to find her friend and his Owner. She find owner and friend and then she gets angry and sad and throws a stupid tantrum that makes no sense. Like what did she expect?! \n I also expected more of the Prince and his Wolf, for such an old and powerful creature he was rather flat and meek. \n I just wish the book went in another direction after chapter 2 or 3."}

{"text": "This second book in the Darkness series follows Sasha's training in magic while she stays with Stephan's vampire-like tribe. Stephan is the leader of his clan, a responsibility he takes dear to heart. It is the reason he does not pursue a match with Sasha, though the two are very much attracted. No, Stephan has been matched to a beautiful, skilled vamp named Darla. \n Charles, the young Watch Commander is in personal charge of keeping Sasha safe from herself, and others. Not an easy job as Sasha's lack of magical skill--yet tremendous magical power--often creates harrowing situations. Like turning her sword into a flame-thrower, or conjuring lethal plant beasts. \n Sasha aches for freedom, even from the visceral link that joins she and Stephan. She leads Charles on some merry chases, and takes him on some high speed drives, trying to soothe the depression she feels for continually failing in her studies. Also, being human she is seen as inferior so she's constantly fighting the sneers of her fellow students. And, faculty--because Darla is one of her teachers. Yes, Darla delights in humiliating Sasha. \n Of course, soon Stephan can't contain his desire for Sasha. His savage lust ends up marking her--a custom seldom practiced in this polyamorous society. No doubt Darla is pissed. \n Meanwhile, the White Mage Trek wants to capture Sasha and drain the magic from her blood to create monsters to fight Stephan's clan. A spy in Stephan's clan succeeds in spiriting Sasha away, yet, Sasha's uncontrolled magic is the key to unraveling Trek's power. \n The story is interesting. There's a lot of intrigue and political machination, particularly as Stephan wrangles between his duty as leader and his desire as a man. It was good to see the pairing of Sasha and Stephen--they make a powerful couple. Plus, his magic acts as a buffer and stabilizer, allowing Sasha to achieve the highest level of magic in their society: black. There's a lot of good banter between Sasha and Charles to lighten the plot. Also, there's some good smexytimes. I struggled a bit with word choice--some stuff just seemed to come out mangled, kinda like Sasha's botched charms. The whole \"color of the magic = power\" thing seemed to take up a bit too much space. I really admired Sasha's willingness to train and persevere in the face of direct opposition. She has a real strong spirit, and her self-deprecation is endearing. The sexy-sexy is at times awkward, and we get over-explaining that can drag the pace a bit, but it's a fun read, nonetheless."}

I like Kaylin; Teela (her friend); small and squawky, who's like an albino but with even less color; her other friends, including the dragons; and especially the buildings. I loved that concept! And the the meaning of the eye colors. And the house-hunting sub-plot is fun. Can she find a landlord who wouldn't worry about a dragon roommate--and her other friends? I enjoyed the repartee, and it helps with filling in the background. The villain is scary; the story suspenseful, and the conflict among some of the characters with their varying agendas is well done. (I'll have to track down the other books in the series.

A war broke out between neighboring kingdoms (aided by Helios' estranged wife) and he was taken captive and sold into sexual slavery. He has no memory of his past because he was implanted with a slave chip that suppresses all his memories and controls his mood to keep him compliant. He has spent the past 5 years as a slave on the planet Warlan. \n One evening his pimp, U'shma, takes him to a dive bar to make some gambling money. Helios catches a glimpse of a man he feels attracted to, and subtly gets his attention. Griffin is a large, formidable man, and he wins Helios's services for a night--what neither of them suspect (because Helios is required to wear the prostitutes mask and long gown) is that Griffin and Helios are both from Arash--and that Griffin was Helios' personal guard (and lover) long before the war began. \n In the privacy of Griffin's room, however, the truth comes out. And it's a tension-filled race to get Helios back to his people, and get his memories restored. I liked this one. The world-building was interesting, and there were lots of good scenes between Griffin and Helios. \n One complaint was the dialogue, which was thoroughly contemporary to the USA, and it drew me out of the story.

There isn't a lot of character interaction, and it almost feels like I'm reading a textbook. The author picks up conversations in the last 30 pages or so but by then it lost me. \n -The owls. I understand that the Beyond is close to the previous series of books with the owls, but it seemed the reader was contantly being drilled that the owls were close and that YES this author was the author of the Owl series. It's like this series couldn't stand alone without the random owl comparison, or sentence. \n -The main character is dull. Not because there isn't a personality but because one isn't developed.

{"text": "Wolf Moon is classic de Lint. Books like this are why I dig around and keep reading de Lint. Wolf Moon focuses on Kern, a shapeshifter who finds himself hunted by a harper. To save himself, Kern jumps into a churning river and is saved by the fae folk (themes!). When the fae bring Kern to the Tinker (themes!), which is an inn, he finds himself attracted to the innkeeper, Ainsey, and wanting to live among the inn folk. However, the vindictive harper (and ho boy, is he an asshole) follows Kern to the valley where the inn is located. The tension in this story is unreal, and if you're not a de Lint fan, this would be a decent place to start for his high fantasy books set in other realms. I think the most powerful (for me at least) theme in de Lint's work is how, even when the world doesn't understand you and stomps on your sense of worth, that human decency can save the day. In the hands of lesser authors, the 'decency can save you' theme would be saccharine, and maybe some people still do find it that way, but good authors can sell this theme and make me feel all the powerful emotions. Wolf Moon is this theme distilled, and every character works in the story, which makes things even worse when one of the dies. Basically, if you're sold on the misfit family group early on, keep reading."}

Harry and Ginny has three kids, and he now works for the Ministry of Magic. Having been through great trials and tragedy, you'd think they live HEA. But for Harry, sometimes the past won't stay in the past. \n Second point, the next generation and the lessons we learn with them as we did with their parents. Albus (Harry's second son) and Scorpius (Draco's son) have become fast friends at Hogwarts. Wanting to right a wrong, they decide to take matters into their own hands (with a bit of outside influence of course) to change the course of the past. But we can't mess with history events without dealing with their consequences... Ones that may turn ripples into waves that drown you under. We see the world that might have been if the Battle of Hogwarts was lost, and what a dark, dark world that would be. \n Someone that surprised me the most was Draco's son, Scorpius. I loved his character immensely. So unexpected, yet so refreshing. I totally ship him and Rose Granger-Weasley together by the way. Oh to see how they develop would be fantastic and a hoot to read. I guess my imagination will have to do. \n I think I enjoyed the book more than my peers because I went into this knowing it isn't a novel. It's written as a play and should be read as such. There's a distinct lack of prose and description that we've experienced in the previous seven books. However, that doesn't make this less magical. It just reads faster as the actions move within the dialogue. \n Thank you JK Rowling, John Tiffany, and Jack Thorne for taking me on this incredible journey with some beloved characters and giving us a glimpse into their lives and a reminder that adventures are always ready to be had. And the best adventures are those shared with friends who will always have your back."}
{"text": "Collins has produced another solid book about Gregor, his friends down in the Underland, and his family. The adventure this time opens up more about his family and introduces more Underland characters. And Gregor is growing up: literally, by having his twelfth birthday, and figuratively by taking on more responsibility, having much more at stake, and seeing more of his comrades-in-arms die fighting. \n I am thrilled that there are two more of these books, and I'll be listening to them as soon as I can."}

He helped Bethany get in touch with her - what he didn't know was that she was his mate. He has his work cut out for him to get her to trust a man again. \n Can Coleen put the past behind her and trust men again? Can Tony make her believe that all men are not the same? Will they become one? Another great read by Kathi S Barton and would recommend to everyone as a must read."}

{"text": "Poor Sookie Stackhouse. Her creator lets the most awful things happen to her. And Charlaine Harris certainly didn't leave anything on the table in this book. It turns out that there are worse enemies to have than vampires and werewolves. Fairies. Who knew? Sookie becomes a pawn in a war between two fairy princes who are fighting to control their world. Even though she has vampire and werewolf allies protecting her, that isn't enough to keep the telepathic barmaid safe. There are also humans who want to kill Sookie. Her friendships with supernatural beings are not looked at favorably by those who would destroy all non-humans. The death toll in this book is rather high and one loss is particularly hard to bear. Dead and Gone is another fantastic installment in the Sookie Stackhouse series. Although Charlaine Harris does try to recap the back story line, this saga has become too complex to start in the middle. Go back to Dead Until Dark and begin at the beginning. You won't be sorry but you could well become obsessed. It's that good."}
{"text": "4.5/5 Stars \n Another great addition to this series! I've missed the characters (my problematic faves) so much, and I loved the new character dynamics that were explored. Even the POVs I thought I would be bored reading were interesting. I took off a star because although I really enjoyed this book, I feel like not much really happened and it was somewhat of a filler compared to the others except for character development purposes. The cliffhanger is killing me, I need the next book (which will be the last.....oh my god) now!!"}

{"text": "I was pretty excited for this one but unfortunately... I was pretty disappointed. \n The only part of the book that was interesting for me was the last 100 pages (Nook eBook edition); but that's just me. There were a lot of things going on but it wasn't as intensely mind-blowing like the other books in this series. Unlike the other books in this series (where I was hooked from the beginning to the end) I was struggling to actually finish this book until I reached those last 100 pages. I will admit that I enjoyed how she ended this book and I loved how she made readers think hard about Sebastian and his truthful plans. Besides that, I don't think I gained any new insight to any of the characters besides Simon's way of thinking when it comes to relationships. \n I simply \"liked\" this book, rather than \"loved\" it and it pains me to say it because I love this series. Either way, I still love this series and will read the next :)"}

{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n I've been meaning to read Three Dark Crowns since it was released last year, but I'm honestly glad I waited until right before One Dark Throne was released because this book had quite the cliffhanger! I ended up really loving this book. The world was so unique from any other fantasy book I've ever read, and learning about it was so interesting. I loved the characters, especially the three sisters. Their development over the course of the book was spectacular. The book was a little slow in the beginning, because although it was really cool to learn about this world, it was a bit info-dump-y. However, once I got a quarter of the way in I was totally hooked. \n One complaint I had about this book was that there were too many characters to keep track of. I understand there being a lot of side characters, because each sister would of course have their own life, but some of them were focused on a little too much for me. It was especially confusing when the point of view would switch to one of the side characters. I understand why this was necessary at certain points, but I wish the story had just been from the point of views of the three sisters. As much as I ended up liking Jules, I wish there had been more focus on Arsinoe and her issues with her powers than there was on her and Joeseph (who I HATED by the way, he's complete trash and it pissed me off how easily Jules kept forgiving him). I did end up liking the side characters though, and even found some of Natalia's sections about Katharine interesting towards the end. \n I kept trying to pick a favorite sister throughout the story, but I honestly could not choose! I loved the poisoner world that Katharine was in, and I hope she has more agency and more of a storyline in book 2. I totally called her and Arsinoe having opposite powers from the beginning (though we don't know for sure that Katharine is a naturalist, it's clear that she and her snake got along pretty well from the beginning and since Arsinoe is a poisoner it would make sense). I'm really interested to read about how Arsinoe and Katharine and their people handle this. Mirabella's sections were interesting as well. I loved that even though she was powerful, she never wanted to kill her sisters until she though Arsinoe attacked her at the end. The endings for all three sisters were wild and I'm so glad that book 2 comes out in a few days so I can dive right into it! I'm so glad that Kendare Blake is writing more books in this series, the world is so vast and I'm excited to learn more about it!"}
{"text": "I'm actually surprised to say that I was more interested in this book then book one for some reason but I don't feel that this book is a 4 star for me. I was definitely more attached to the story but I still am annoyed by Alina and Mal's relationship. In book one I kind of liked them as a couple but I just got tired of them and this book didn't make me like them better. Is it wrong for me to be rooting for the Darkling? I just find myself liking the Darkling more then Mal who just annoys me. Also i haven't been the biggest fan of Alina as well which makes it hard for me to really like this book. I mentioned in my review for book one that I wish I would of read this series before Six of Crows because of the world building but now I'm also think because I'm a bit disappointed with this series after reading Six of Crows. Im still going to continue with this series though. I know this review isn't quite \"on the bright side\" but I'm still interested in continuing this series. Overall 3 star rating."}
{"text": "Gaiman, Neil writes fantasy in a contemporary setting as well as anyone today. American Gods draws on his extensive knowledge from mythologies the world over to create a rich tapestry. But this book is more than just a fantastic tale of a world where the gods of the Old World exist and migrated to the New with the peoples who worship them. This is a book about America written as only someone who knows it from an immigrant's point-of-view can experience it. \n Gaiman's book expresses the ideal of America as a refuge for immigrants and outsiders. In a vignette, we meet a homosexual man who can only express his homosexuality in America. And yet, this man's homosexuality is shown to be inextricable from his native culture. This man finds self-expression in America, but his self-expression is rooted in his native culture. \n Immigrants to America bring the richness of their native cultures with their them. The gods in this novel are a metaphor for the rich cultural diversity of America. Some are well-known, some are mostly forgotten. America is a construct of the peoples and cultures that inhabit it. \n It's no accident that Shadow, the main character of this story, is an ex-con. He is an outsider. Gaiman makes a hero of the social misfit. He is expressing a fundamentally progressive view that criminals can be rehabilitated, that they can do good for society. \n This book celebrates the American landscape. Shadow travels far and wide. Immigrants, I've found often appreciate the size and scope of America, stretching across a continent and taking in multitudes of climes. Garth Ennis shows a similar reverence for America, be it New York or the Mississippi bayou. \n Gaiman has crafted a powerful narrative that vision of a pluralistic America. Gaiman's America draws strength from the diverse multitudes that shape it. It is a vast land that is offers refuge to the repressed, to the oppressed, and to the outcast; it stands as a stark contrast to the monolithic image cast by conservatives of a nation with a single cultural core, a \"Judeo-Christian\" tradition traced back to the Pilgrims. \n This book celebrates America as only an immigrant can. Those born in many parts of America experience diversity in their daily lives unknown almost anywhere else in the world. Gaiman appreciates the difference between America and the Old World. But he also celebrates how the Old World built the New. This book is an absolutely masterful example of contemporary fantasy and one of the best novels about the idea of America."}
{"text": "Whoa... totally not what I was expecting when I started this book. I was a little weary at first, but that was kicked fast as I got to reading. It was a great book and I loved the different outlook on the who angel/demon take. And I'm glad it ended right. I was almost mad there at the end I thought it was gonna end in a twist I didn't think I could handle, but even with the twist I loved it!!!"}
{"text": "Good stand alone fantasy and written very well, but plagued with some problems that almost made me put the book down completely a couple of times. \n Almost all female characters in the book are written as innocent flowers that, nonetheless, turn into sexual vixens within a chapter of their introduction. This happens a great deal and gets to be incredibly annoying. There is an incest sub-plot that ends up serving absolutely no purpose and seems dropped in just to shock. The book takes lots of random detours, even more than half way into the book, and one such incidence is just an incredible jarring deus-ex-machina that doesn't jive with the feel of the rest of the book. \n Finally, there's an incredibly distracting amount of torture description/imagery. I'm not squeamish here, but the amount of it (and the fact that a lot of it specifically mentions it happening to children) is enough to bother even the biggest fan of dark fantasy. \n A good plot, however, when they decided to follow it, and a great ending, both of which saved the book from a lower score."}
{"text": "2.5 STARS I honestly don't know how to explain my liking of this book. There was too much story and not enough details. I am baffled by the little amount I knew about the main characters and the reasons behind the plot by the end. While all of this has left me questioning why I bothered reading the whole book, I have to say that the promise of an epic book is there. I just needed more info...why did we need to see the parallels? Why did the world end and put the Romani's against the rest of the world? Where did the skin eaters come from/who is to blame? I can go on and on about how much I don't know and I can tell you very little about what I do know for certain. \n I will be trying book two, but I'm looking for answers. If I do not get any, I may not recommend this book for anyone."}

And now there's a blender thrown into the mix...

{"text": "8/9th&up \n 3.5 stars \n With such an intriguing concept, and from a popular author, I had high expectations of this book. Too high? \n It took me quite a long time to get into the story- I never disliked it, but it didn't completely capture my attention until 3/4 of the way through. Puck and Sean were well developed, interesting characters, but I guess I wasn't feeling the hard scrabbled life on the island. The setting, and the story, wasn't as magical or exciting as I thought it would be. \n In the end, however, I was glad that I stuck with the book and I was pleased with the resolution of the story. \n Add a star if you're a horse lover, or your a fan of anything that has the Stiefvater name attached."}

I thought I wasn't going to be big on the whole multiple worlds thing, but it worked really well in this book. I think Becca was my favorite character and I wish she'd had a POV. Adam was really interesting too, and I can't wait to see where the next book takes him and his relationship with Farrell. I also really liked the relationship between Becca and Crys and I'm excited for more of that in book 2 as well. The whole secret society storyline was really interesting. I wasn't really all that invested in either of the romantic relationships, but I liked them well enough. Overall I really enjoyed this book (though not as much as Falling Kingdoms) and I can't wait for the next one!"}
{"text": "DWED Reviews-The Chronicles of Covent Kingsblood, Tale two of The Shade Chronicles \n Review Rating- ***** 5 stars \n I was very intrigued by Kingsblood. It was almost as if I was stepping into a 3D realm of vast open marshes, blood and gore, Assassins and culturally depraved characters, which in our day would be thought of as menial and poor. J. L Ficks has a very vast imagination. \n I wish this was a video game! I am a girly nerd, not that that is a bad thing. I love anything creative, from books to art, from painting to playing a video game on my Xbox 360. I could totally see myself glued to the TV mastering the arts of being an assassin. In Kingsblood I would be playing the title character Shade, who is not your ordinary assassin. He has a conscience. He has a soul. He fights with himself constantly because he was trained to be a killer and nothing else. Not a family man, not a robin-hood save the world from degradation. He was trained to serve his king and I loved the fact that not only was he a kick ass soldier, but he was also in sync with his inner compassion. Though he fought it, it could not be taken from him. He was still a lost boy searching for a reason to live. \n But the book is not just about Shade and his missions. It's about unique characters with different races that can be easily related to. They have in-depth personalities, even their surroundings is visually stimulating. There were times when I became confused, I had to put the book down and go online to the website and read about all the races, characters, view the map to get a good vision of what I was reading. And that's what hooked me most. There is an interactive site! I don't have to rely on just my own imagination. The Author has given us an expansive tool to really enjoy the book. To get a feel for what he wants the reader to visualize as they follow Shade on his journey. \n I don't want to spoil this experience for anyone, so I will not go into much detail. You have to read this book. You have to visit the site. You will be amazed at how much heart, time and effort J. L. Ficks has put into this series. Its original, it's fascinating and it will leave you wanting more. \n I would not recommend this book if you don't want to put in the time to read it. To understand the world J. L. Ficks has created I really suggest you go to the site; learn about the world, character and races before diving right in. But if you are a fantasy and action lover, this is definitely the book for you. \n Great Job J. L, you put your soul into this and I can honestly say it was an amazing journey reading this novel."}

{"text": "It's long been my contention that Brazilian fiction is about 40 years ahead of American fiction, and this book seems to prove it. First published in Brazil in 1980, it feels like it could be published in the U.S. right now. This is the story of Guedali, a boy born on the plains of southern Brazil with a centaur's body, and how he makes his way in the world. It's not really about being a centaur, of course, but about being ashamed of the body you were born with and wishing you could change yourself into something better (or at least more normal). Guedali eventually has his wish granted and becomes something resembling a regular human, but as often happens in real life when people go on extreme diets or have plastic surgery, he ends up no happier than he was before and starts to wish he could change back again. \n As translated by Margaret A. Neves, Scliar's prose is simple yet serviceable. The focus here is not on beautiful language, but on accurately rendering Guedali's stream of consciousness and all the subtle gradations of his emotions. \n If you've never tried any Brazilian fiction but have enjoyed books like The Snow Child or The Book of Speculation, you might want to add this to your list. (It's not even hard to find! Used copies of this edition are plentiful and available on Amazon for about $3.) Try it. You just might like it."}
{"text": "5 utterly beautiful and captivating stars \n The third installment was more than I expected, with revelations and surprises that took me on a journey that evoke emotions that not many books can create. \n This was a love story beginning from the first book to the third one. It's a love story not just for two soul mates, but also the love from a father to a daughter, a brotherhood, a sisterhood, family made from blood and the ones that become your family as you connect with people in the journey of life. \n \"I think I'd pull down heaven if that's what it took to keep you here with me.\" \n \"And I'd abandon it if you weren't there.\" \n Ava and Malachi's love was beautiful, one of the best love stories I've read. They were easy with one another even though their journey was one of hardship, heartbreak, and grief. I think that's why their HEA felt much more momentous. I love the way they found their way back to each other and learning about one another again as well as discovering where/whom they came from. \n That discovery was the biggest secret of all. Never would I have even thought to go in the direction that Hunter did, and she did it so well. It was magical, shocking, sorrowful, and lovely all in all. \n The archangels (the Fallen) are at war and these characters are caught in that war unaware of the connections they are a part of. Everything was so well written and imagined, the characters developed into their own, and the plot became more intense with each chapter. \n Even though their story ended, Ava and Malachi will stay with me for a long, long time. I'm glad the series isn't completely over yet, and am patiently waiting for more. \n If you want to experience an excellent love story of joy, heartbreak, wonder, and a slew of other emotions, this series is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. \n Definitely favorite read of 2015 thus far."}
{"text": "loved the art, and the story rolled along pleasantly."}
{"text": "Into the Abyss by J.L. Langland \n I pulled this book from a recommendation thread on r/Fantasy, and the premise was entertaining. Tom, a normal boy in our world, goes to a party and gets summoned into another world-as a powerful demon. Tom's soul is effectively ripped from him, he dies, and he's bound as a demon slave in Astlan. Being a powerful demon yet a slave is a contradiction, and this story is riddled with uncomfortable moments for Tom while he comes to terms with not being human (yet still obviously remembering and thinking of himself as human) and with being a pawn in a magical war where both sides (there are 2 powerful wizards at war) are afraid of him. \n The story turned out not to be clunky, either, which was a fantastic surprise. It gets a bit unwieldy as it goes on by adding too many uninteresting POVs but most of the characters in Into the Abyss matter (at least in the first 3/4 of the book...the army generals and wizards that get introduced as POV characters later are forgettable and boring). Tom as the main character is definitely interesting, and he has to deal with the duality of being a human and a demon, and he finds himself slotted into the default 'evil hell spawn' role rather he wants to be or not. The wizards of Astlan don't understand where demons come from (aka normal souls from other dimensions). When Tom becomes a demon, he has trouble with controlling his master's missives and his demonic impulses. Jenn, a young wizard, starts out as a more interesting character, but she becomes a less interesting character as she (a supposedly intelligent and otherwise compassionate woman) is played as a bit of a fool when she irrationally and instinctively distrusts Tom. This is maybe my biggest character complaint-there are characters that do act irrationally For The Plot. Jenn is the biggest violator, but even the better characters like Tom and Rupert get in on the action. The maligned and traitorous wizard, Gastrope, is maybe the most rational character because he has a reason to distrust Tom (he almost murdered him and scared the shit out of him), but Gastrope is the character that makes active attempts to come to term with Tom and (spoiler) Rupert being demons. \n Now, let's get to the MVP character of the story-Rupert. I would've read a story 1/2 this length that was just about Tom and Rupert, and their big brother/little brother relationship is seriously sweet. Rupert was a born demon, and he appears to be a major exception to the 'ripping souls from other dimensions' rule of how demons are made in Astlan. Rupert disguised himself as a wizard when he started to turn into a demon, and it's Rupert that teaches Tom to shapeshift from demon to human. There's a truly touching scene where Rupert reveals his demonic self to Tom, who realizes he and Rupert are the only two people in Astlan who really understand each other. Rupert talks about how he ran away when he started to become a demon, and then Rupert drops a bomb-he thinks Tom is his father because they do look exactly alike. (If you think about it, there's a magical in-story reason this could be, even if the book doesn't address it.) This adds levels of questions and confusion to the plot, and Tom, being somewhat sympathetic and simultaneously spineless, decides to let Rupert believe he's Tom's son. \n After a series of okay-but-sometimes-boring plot developments, Tom & Co. find themselves in Freehold, where the political situation has spiraled out of control. The two wizards are still at war, but there are archdemons involved, too. There's also a McGuffin book, which doesn't figure too much into the early plot but the wizards are really interested to open it and control the astral planes. The most interesting development is that the Rod of Teirnon, a religious army of a literal warrior God, converge on Freehold to route out the demons. The Rod is led by Talerius, their Knight Rampant, and there's a truly climactic battle at the end of the story between Tom and Talerius. As with much of this story, there's a bit too much padding around the fight, but it's amazing, and unlike with some books I've read recently, the ending doesn't disappoint. \n Rating: 4 stars for the story, even when it does feel a bit unpolished and a bit unwieldy."}

{"text": "I honestly don't know what to make of this first book. I loved both the Jolie Series and Dulcie Series. Both series has caught my attention right from book 1. Lilly's a little....blah. It's still a great story, but I think it went a bit overboard with the inspirational quotes. I feel as if it lacks....something I can't put my finger on that both Jolie and Dulcie series has that caught my attention right away. :) I will still read book 2 when it comes out though. Like I said I still like the story AND the characters. Bill is just hilarious. I found my self literally LOL while I was reading it."}
{"text": "Hammered is by far the best book in this series. Reading or listening to the first three books is highly encouraged. They're pretty short, and this is one of those series that I really like on audio books. Hearne has this skill with making every mythology figure kind of a dick, too, and it pays off in this book. Big time. There's no romanticizing mythology in Iron Druid."}

{"text": "I fell in love with this story very quickly. It does take a few chapters to get going, but once it does, it captivates you. You fall into this world of dragons, magic, and sword play. You follow a young boy as he discovers who and what he is. Throughout the four books you watch Eragon, along with Sephira, learn and grow. I truly wish and believe that this book should be required reading for students. Not only would they enjoy it and actually read it, they may even learn something. Christopher Paolini gave us a wonderful look in to his amazing mind. I loved it so much that i bought all the books for myself and my husband for Christmas this year. I believe every one should read this book, along with their children. You will fall in love and want to read it over and over."}
{"text": "*general SPOILERS for previous books* \n The Lynburn Legacy is one of the best bondfics of all times. I particularly like its insistence on bonds being optional, even psychic magical ones! \n I'm not completely sure about the sharpness of the writing, but it did have me in tears, of despair and joy both so a 4.5 stars ratings is the least I can give it. \n The trilogy overall is great, an improvement on the already pretty neat Demon Lexicon but depsite the witty dialogue and profound connections, both familiar and romantic, one can tell SRB has some growing to do as a plotter. The ending was neatly wrapped, both emotionally and logically, but I did not appreciate the reminders to earlier plot points (as if SRB suspects the reader has forgotten or worse, not read, the previous two parts of the trilogy.) \n Lovely, I will be copying out an infinitive of quotes."}

{"text": "I wanted to like this book, but I didn't. \n I saw the third book in the Miriam Black series on the \"NEW\" shelf at the library, and it had an endorsement blurb from one of my favorite horror writers, Lauren Beukes. But I couldn't start with the third, so I checked out all three books, and returned all three of them the following week, having only read this first. I will not finish the series. \n It's an interesting premise that is written by a man who is trying to write a hard-boiled manic pixie dream girl, and it's so annoying. Miriam is the girl who eats like a pig and never gains weight; she smokes; she loves sex; she can kick someone's ass in a fight. But it's all so obviously written through a male gaze and it never rings true and is occasionally offensive. Example: Wendig writes a \"sex\" scene that begins with Miriam resisting, and saying no even though she doesn't really mean \"no.\" Wow. Really, Chuck Wendig? You did that? Yes. He did. And then Miriam jokes the next morning to Ashley, her (male) partner, that he pretty much raped her. And, well, he did. So, that was shit to read. \n After that scene, I checked out. It didn't get worse from there, but it certainly didn't get better. If nothing else, this book solidified my feeling that I'm over and done with reading books by straight white men, at least for a good long while. I tried this because of the Beaukes blurb, but I shouldn't have. Instead, I'll just read more Beukes."}

She created a whole, brilliantly grey and morally ambiguous. It was unpredictable and intriguing and I liked it. \n The ONLY reason this book is less than perfect is because I struggle with creepy stuff, it's not my favorite.

{"text": "See full review for Mortal Heart at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n Like with Dark Triumph, Mortal Heart really isn't a sequel. It takes place in the same world with the same characters but the narrator again is different. This time around we follow the story from Annith's point of view. She's friends with Ismae and Syabella, but unlike the two she hasn't been sent out on a mission yet even though she's been at the convent the longest. She fears that the abbess will keep her there to become the convent's new Seer and she doesn't want that. She wants to be like her friends and fellow sisters and go out on a mission. When it becomes abundantly clear that that won't happen (confirmation from the abbess and a young member of the convent being sent out onto a mission), Annith decides to take matters into her own hands. \n She rides out to confront the abbess who has gone to court, but gets a little sidelined. On her first night on her own, she runs across the hellequins - the demon riders from the Underworld who escort the souls marked - and fears that they are hunting her because she ran from the convent. But they aren't. If anything the lead - Balthazar - takes her into the group to make sure that she is well protected. But not everything is as it seems. Even as she starts to slowly fall for the man, she discovers that he may actually be hunting her and takes off during the day. She arrives at court - with some help from the followers of a different God, the name escapes me at the moment - and faces the abbess with her accusations and the real reason for why she has been held back from missions eventually comes out."}
{"text": "Note: I got free copy of The Huntress: The Beginnings from the author in exchange for an honest review. \n The Huntress: The Beginnings by Nadja Losbohm is the first instalment in The Huntress series. Originally published in German, the novella (around 150 pages) is about Ada, whose life is turned around when she is told that she is destined to become a Huntress. \n Ada Pearce is an overweight ordinary woman, who hates sports. Helping a neighbour, she enters St. Mary's Church and is told that she has to leave her life and everything behind her to become a Huntress. \n There, her trainer and only companion is Father Michael, whom we learn does not age like normal people and has his life tied to being inside the church. \n Narrated in the first person from Ada's perspective, the novella opens with Ada telling the reader that she is pregnant and is going to meet with a reporter (Dan Meyers) to tell the world her story and get them to realise that there are monsters on the streets that they need to be careful of. Although Father Michael originally opposes the idea, he understands Ada's need to keep people safe. \n \"So, when I can't make my rounds, who else is there to protect all those people from what's lurking in the dark?\" \n A Hunter or Huntress comes along once every fifty years. With Ada's pregnancy, there will be several months of Huntress-free streets, making it a monster-playground. \n The prologue is after Ada discovers her role as a Huntress. As the novella moves forward, she tells the reader how that happens. \n \"My name is Ada Pearce, I'm twenty-four years old and I'm a vampire and monster hunter.\" \n The Huntress: The Beginnings is based on flashbacks as Ada tells the reporter her story. Some flashbacks are stories told to the reader and not the reporter owing to their sensitivity or simply because they are too private to be shared. Because of the flashbacks, there isn't a fixed pace for the novel. \n Although the narration is from Ada's perspective, we get glimpses into Father Michael's life - after he learns to trust her - and how he has struggled over the years to become the man he is today. \n We also see Ada progress from one who curses all the time to someone who begins to respect the institution she is in and the man in charge of it. At several points at the beginning of the novella, Father Michael warns her that if she continues to curse, he will throw her out. Her interests and concerns also change and she learns acceptance (among other things). \n She also learns to see past Father Michael's rough exterior and the walls he has put around himself over the years. \n Ada is fairly sarcastic, adding comic relief from time to time. Moreover, her interactions and situations with Father Michael, a man who has only trained Hunters for centuries, are quite funny. \n \"The Father had no idea about matters of a female nature.\" \n I particularly enjoyed those parts of the flashbacks, which show Father Michael's 'human' side and how time affects people who live in closed places (kind of like being with a grandparent). \n \"Everything about his face seemed to be crying out with pain. His black eyes shone wet as horrible images of events in his past raged behind the veil of tears.\" \n The Huntress is also a romance novella. From the beginning, we are told who the father of Ada's baby is, which should not come as a shock to readers since the couple lives together. \n \"Every time you go out there in the dark, I die anew,\" he whispered. \"I die with fear. I die with worry. I feel helpless every time I stay behind. I can't help you, can't protect you when you need it.\" \n I like the use of fairy-tale and other references in the novella. Father Michael tells Ada that she resembles Snow White, and that he finds the seven dwarfs to be scary. \n Although, I haven't read the original Grimm Fairy Tales, there are several references in The Huntress, which have encouraged me to consider reading the originals. \n \"Where do you think the authors of such books...got their ideas from? There's always a grain of truth in every legend.\" Ada tells the reporter in their first meeting. \n The novella is not devoid of monster-hunting. Although, apart from vampires, we do not get the names of monsters, we are given description details of each. Personally, I wished there were more details in the fighting, still a pregnant woman everything a not pregnant one can. \n \"Why weren't there any good-looking, nice-smelling monsters? I suddenly found myself wondering.\" \n The novella falls under the young adult genre and has no adult content, with the exception of minor insinuations. \n The first instalment in the series, The Huntress: The Beginnings is an enjoyable read. It sets the ground for the next three books as well as Ada's and Father Michael's world. \n Should the following instalments be translated into English I look forward to reading them. In the meantime, I'm content with Ada, her journey and her transformation."}

{"text": "Po, I love you. \n For one thing, he's different to other love interests in YA fiction. He's not the usual dark, handsome, mysterious hero who turns up out of the blue. Goodness knows there's enough of those canonical heroic types featuring in the genre of fantasy and romance. \n Po is an admirable character. He's confident without crossing the line into being a jerk. He's selfless but he also knows how not to be too self-sacrificing. He's not too flowery with his language (despite being a flashy character). \n \"I know you don't want this, Katsa. But I can't help myself. The moment you came barreling into my life I was lost. I'm afraid to tell you what I wish for, for fear you'll... oh, I don't know, throw me into the fire. Or more likely, refuse me. Or worst of all, despise me,\" he said, his voice breaking and his eyes dropping from her face. His face dropping into his hands. \"I love you,\" he said. \"You're more dear to my heart than I ever knew anyone could be. And I've made you cry; and there I'll stop.\" \n Even how he was described (visually) in Graceling sent shivers skating down my spine. And for some reason, I kept on imagining Po as Orlando Bloom. No, I'm not talking about Legolas. I'm talking about how he looked in his role as Will Turner. \n Can you see it? Can you?!?! \n With Katsa though, I was more than a little disappointed. When I first read the blurb (which is flipping awesome), I wanted to know her. She sounded awesome. \n Katsa has been able to kill a man with her bare hands since she was eight - she's a Graceling, one of the rare people in her land born with an extreme skill. As niece of the king, she should be able to live a life of privilege, but Graced as she is with killing, she is forced to work as the king's thug. \n When she first meets Prince Po, Graced with combat skills, Katsa has no hint of how her life is about to change. \n I wanted what the blurb promised me. \n I wanted a bad-ass heroine. Instead, I received a flower dressed up in armor too big for her. At the end of the book though, Katsa became more than slightly tolerable. So I suppose that will have to make up for my failed expectations. \n Her character is incredibly unrealistic as well. So incredibly disappointing. \n P.S About Po's vision, is it too sadistic of me to say that I liked that he lost it? For me, it balanced out his advantageous mental abilities. Sort of like the universe setting things right again. But when I told a fellow lover of Po about what I thought, she didn't...quite have the same feelings as I did. \n I spent the rest of that day vainly using lollies and chocolate as bargaining chips to assuage that friend's hurt feelings. I was also trying not to get killed. \n It didn't work. -_- \n But I'm still happy with how events turned out in Graceling."}

{"text": "Last year, Maria V. Snyder continued to tell the story of Yelena and Valek. While readers got brief glimpses of these two characters in her Glass Series, this new series focused mainly on their trials and tribulations. Unfortunately, returning to this world wasn't everything I expected it to be. \n Shadow Study was by far not the strongest book from Snyder that I read. The pacing felt off, the story felt overused, and the introduction of varying POV just made the entire novel feel 'off'. It wasn't bad, but to me the other books felt smoother, faster paced, and overall more enjoyable. However, I didn't want to give up on the series and so I continued to read the second novel - Night Study. \n Snyder appears to have learned from some of the mistakes that occurred in Shadow Study. First, the main POVs are between Yelena and Valek. There is an occasional chapter told by Leif and two chapters from Janco, but there weren't as many side missions/quests and varying stories from other characters. This gives the book a smoother, more polished feel to it that the first book was lacking. \n It wasn't that I didn't like Janco from Shadow Study. I found him overly played out. He used cutesy nicknames and it got a bit old after a while. Leif, when he did tell his story, was more mature and likeable. Of course, this is all a personal preference. Some will love the new focus; others will wish Janco was back. \n Unfortunately, even the shift of focus on POVs couldn't fix a pacing problem. The first 50% of the novel was extremely slow. There was a lot of back and forth between a personal issue Yelena was going through (I don't want to say what it is because it'd spoil the first book). This dragged down the pacing of the novel. I found I just didn't care about it one way or another so having so much focus on it made the book go by slower. \n Another issue I had with the first part of Night Study was for a good 25% of the novel there is this huge sense of urgency to find these hidden greenhouses. All of a sudden, this issue was wrapped up in a quick page or two and then the focus is shifted elsewhere. So much time was spent building up this plot element and it didn't really go anywhere. \n I will say the second half of the book was amazing. Snyder takes readers deeper into Valek's past, which is something I have always wondered about and wanted to know more. There were hints given throughout the previous novels, but it was nice to really see it all laid out. This part of the novel was so enjoyable and it seemed to have gone by so fast. In fact, it is this little twist and part of the novel that actually will keep me reading the series - for now. \n There is one point I would like to bring up - the relationship with Valek and Yelena. Things seem to be moving way too fast. I really would have liked to see things slow down a little and really show readers their interactions. It seems to be a growing trend to break the two up and split them up - which is fine, but it leaves me with a rushed relationship feeling to it. \n Overall, Night Study was about what I expected. My expectations weren't too high based on my mixed feelings from Shadow Study, but I found a few unexpected plot twists entertaining. For myself, it doesn't capture the inspiring 'love it' feeling I had with the Study Series or the Glass Series, but that is okay. I think fans of Snyder will enjoy it and love it, which is ultimately all that really matters."}

{"text": "Voglio ringraziare Raffaella per aver inviato al nostro blog le copie del suo libro, e per essere stata molto disponibile e gentile. Da lettrice scrupolosa e onesta quale sono, voglio darle il mio sincero e personale parere. \n Recensire questo libro sara tosto, perche nonostante lo abbia apprezzato, alcuni aspetti non hanno saputo convincermi del tutto. Inizio dicendo che la trama e la stupenda cover mi avevano stregata sin dal primo momento, dato che ultimamente l'originalita e qualcosa di \"poco visto-letto\". Quindi avevo molte aspettative che per certi versi hanno trovato conferma tra le pagine di Gala Cox, ma a non convincermi e stato lo stile della Fenoglio. Uno stile poco fluido che non mi ha fatto apprezzare come avrei voluto questa lettura. Troppe se non eccessive descrizioni di luoghi e personaggi hanno reso la storia a tratti lenta. L'uso in maniera eccessiva del punto, preferito alle virgole, ha dato vita ad una serie di frasi spezzate che hanno reso i paragrafi poco scorrevoli. Non sono riuscita inoltre ad entrare in sintonia con alcuni protagonisti, Gala in primis, perche i suoi continui flashback durante una conversazione al presente, distoglievano ulteriormente l'attenzione del lettore. Persa sempre tra ricordi e ipotetiche genialate non ha saputo creare quell'empatia che pretendevo. Anche io il suo amico Dennis... Per carita carino e amichevole ok, ma tutto quel trascinare le \"vocaaali\" ha reso a mio avviso il suo atteggiamento troppo \"bambinesco\". \n La storia in se ha quell'originalita e quel pizzico di mistero che incuriosisce e intriga, ma queste piccole pecche lo hanno penalizzato. Una sforbiciatina qua e la avrebbe di certo giovato alla trama, ai fini della scorrevolezza. \n Per quanto riguarda l'evoluzione della storia e la caratterizzazione dei personaggi, posso dire che Raffaella ha saputo creare quel mix di mistero e colpi di scena molto interessanti. \n Sono certa che la Fenoglio sapra stupirmi nel seguito, dato che nelle ultime pagine ha sganciato la bomba! \n Una lettura gradevole che pero non mi ha convinta del tutto ~.~"}
{"text": "predictable but also entertaining...."}
{"text": "This is a story for people who love books. I don't just mean people who enjoy reading; I mean people who are steeped in classic British, European, and American literature. The protagonist, Janet Carter, is an English major at Blackstock College, and Dean pays loving tribute to more or less her entire syllabus over four years. Characters frequently communicate by quoting classic literature at each other, and the names of authors, poets, and literary works litter the pages. \n Do not be intimidated, though! The first time I read this book, I was still in high school, and did not get many of the references, but by God, I wanted to. Reading it made me very excited about going to college. I, too, wanted to be steeped in great literature, spend my time with good-looking and highly literate people, and go on exciting and magical adventures. \n Rereading now, almost 15 years after graduating from college, is a different experience, but no less enjoyable. I did have an exciting and magical experience of college, minus the frequent literary quotations and fairies (though plenty of ghost stories), so the story brings up a good deal of nostalgia for me. I also understand many more (though not all) of the references now, and there are many aspects that I appreciate about the story now that I took for granted as a teenager. \n Tam Lin is heavily focused on its female cast and female friendships. A large cast of young women are depicted with a variety of personalities and interests. They do not always get along with each other, but they do always find common ground in the end, and they all seem like real people. The major male characters, though they are key to the plot, largely serve the role of love interests for Janet and her roommates. The subjects of menstruation, sex, birth control, suicide, and unplanned pregnancy are all addressed and openly discussed by the female protagonists, and some of these subjects are, in fact, key to the story. \n One thing I look for in the books I read these days is good representation of more than just straight, white characters, and while this book is awesome on women, it is rather disappointing here. While the sexuality of a couple of the characters is speculated on, nothing is ever confirmed. All of the relationships, even among the background characters, are heterosexual. There are four mentioned POC characters, two black and two east Asian, but they all serve in fairly minor roles with no direct contribution to the main plot. \n Dean's writing style has some small issues as well. She tends to go a little heavy on the adjectives and adverbs for my tastes, and sometimes her sentences have more clauses than are strictly necessary. She also describes the scenery in great detail every time the characters move to a new location, but I didn't mind that so much. \n I had the silly thought while reading that Tam Lin is sort of like Twilight-done-right. Girl moves to new place and wonders WTF is up with all these attractive and vaguely mysterious people. But Janet isn't completely focussed on and devoted to her man, and when he behaves like an ass, she has no problem taking him to task for it. She is entirely prepared to enjoy her time at college and get a good educagtion without getting too serious about romance, until fate intervenes to change her plans."}

{"text": "I have waited a year for this book! And it met my expectations and so much more. The upcoming battle that was so much anticipated was amazing and I have stayed up way past my bed time reading this book because I couldn't put it down. \n Coe does a wonderful job of tying up every single thread that was started in The Blood of the Southlands Trilogy. I have to say I was impressed. There wasn't one part that left me wonder well what happened here... or what happened there. It was always artfully mastered how all the threads came together in the epic battle. \n There was something about the characters in this book that made me feel so close and connected to them. I don't remember feeling that in the other books. \n Coe does cut down on the amount of backtracking in this book but give enough information to keep those that have trouble remembering what happened up to date :) \n I'd love to see more books in this but if not I'd be happy with the way things left off. \n If you are looking for epic fantasy like it should be written give Coe a try."}

The details about the characters are vivid and well done, giving you the feeling that you're really inside the story. There's this one really scary scene where Zara is running on the road in the middle of the night that totally gave me chills. I made the mistake of reading that scene just before I went to sleep and ended up with nightmares about it, that's how well done it was. Now I'm itching to get my hands on the second book. Good job Carrie Jones."}

In fact, it was so predictable that I skipped to the last two chapters (from chapter nine, mind you) and followed the ending perfectly well. \n The writing style flows pretty easy, which is why I gave it two stars, but other than that this book isn't worth the reading time."}

{"text": "A world apart is an excellent book. It is a story that covers four generations, who grew up in Doves Meadow. The majority of the story though, is about three friends, Demetrius, Eleyna and Halcyon. As kids they form their own gang and challenge each other's skills. As teenagers Demetrius and Eleyna have discovered they love each other but cannot find the courage to tell each other. Due to miscommunication and misunderstanding, Eleyna agrees to marry Halcyon. The choices they made change the course of their lives forever. On the day of their marriage Demetrius leaves Dove's Meadow to join the Order, the military government that runs Elecheron. Eleyna and Halcyon find themselves in a circumstance that brands them as outlaws, murderers. They flee for their lives and end up working on a pirate ship. Due to a twist in fate, unbeknownst to Eleyna and Halcyon, they sidetrack Demetrius's career, sentencing him to the Pit, a sewer infested hole, with other thieves. This story has many twists and turns and some things you know are coming but you don't know how. This is not a quick read, but it is a very interesting one. David has created this whole other world, Elecheron and has done an excellent job of doing just that. I look forward to reading more by this author."}

He has a plan, he has knowledge, and he is ready. \n I loved this book. I love this type of science fiction, and the premise of the book was amazing. Fortunately, the rest of the book delivered. \n I enjoyed the characters, the story, the setting and specially the superpowers. I saw some twists coming, but others took me by surprise.

She and her three friends barely have a chance to examine the game before her younger brother bursts into her room and starts to play- and promptly disappears. Faced with no choice but to follow him, Farah and her friends find themselves in a dangerous and magical world where losing the game will have deadly consequences. \n A little bit of Labyrinth, a lot of Jumanji, and plenty of potential (not entirely met) combine in this debut novel. \n Personally, I wasn't completely drawn in by the writing or action for most of the story, though the ending kicked up nicely & I loved the inclusion of a Muslim American main character with plenty of references to her Bangladesh culture, family, & mythology as well.

Why? Because I always feel like there are high expectations for that book and they can never live up to their predecessor. Desires of the Dead was no exception. I'll admit something else: my fear was rational. \n Don't get me wrong, Desires of the Dead was amazing. This time around there isn't a serial killer for Violet to find. Instead a mysterious person is terrorizing her from her school and the FBI. You see she found a missing boy's body while she was in the city with her friend Chelsea and she called in an anonymous tip that turned out to be not so anonymous. But this member of the FBI, Sara Priest, is different. She has a team of special people who have abilities like Violet...or so you think. Nothing is really said about this other members of Priest's team, and the only member you really meet is Rafe, but his 'power' isn't revealed at all. Although I do have my suspicions.

Like for instance, because of Imogene's death a new Inquisitor had to be appointed and honestly. Is it some sort of job requirement that the Inquisitor has to have a vendetta against Downworlders?

{"text": "This story had such a powerful start, I loved the first chapter and even got a ways into the story but then it kind of went sideways for me. The writing is good, there were some graphic, gruesome scenes but they held my attention and kept me wondering where the story was going - I'm always rooting for good to win over evil, and there was definitely some evil in this story. This story clearly outlined and gave a really good sense of the fanaticism and small mindedness of some. The characters were well crafted. Unfortunately I found myself about halfway through and felt disconnected from the story and from Xantara, well any of them really. I think the story idea is great but too many characters were constantly being introduced, almost right to the end. I'm a fan of thrillers and meeting lots of characters but not introduced so late. Also I lost touch with Xanatra who's story I thought this would be about as she was who it started with. There wasn't anyone who was present enough throughout to connect with. In some cases I also felt that resolving the issue was too rushed. The story which started out great seemed to become more about sharing a message then about the story. With some changes this would be a great read."}
{"text": "Seen Poltergeist? Read your fair share of ghost stories? Then do yourself a favor Nf pass on this one. There's absolutely nothing original and very little that's even borderline scary in this supposed \"novel of terror.\" in many sections, it feels as if the author is purposely trying to pad in order to give the book more heft. This is particularly true of sections containing conversations. Endless exposition and boringly trite talk dint make for a compelling read. Although the book starts interestingly enough, it quickly becomes downright predictible. Worse, the characters behave in wildly unbelievable ways. Long after a smart person would say, \"Okay, clearly we should never go into that house again,\" these folks find almost comically ridiculous reasons to do so."}
{"text": "Writing one star reviews is a drag, but this isn't even 'so bad it's good.' It's just a slog of a story. Any elements that might have potentially been interesting are lost in the mess. (Note: that's not to say the writing itself is incorrect or bad. It's not. The problems are with the overall story.) This should've been about a third of the length with a narrower scope. There's simply too much description, and if you're going to pack your story with that many words, you've got to earn them. Spoiler: this story doesn't. \n Personal rant (and what convinced me this story wasn't going to have a late book comeback): If you don't know about cross country travel and you want to write it into your epic fantasy, run your story by someone who knows how outdoor travel works. This section made me want to scream but not with joy. Everyone uses maps or a compass, so Kamarie's 'know these woods skills' logic wouldn't freaking work. You get lost SO EASILY in the woods. Then, there's this gem: \"How did you learn about firewood?\" Yet, she can't tell upstream from downstream? Has she seen water? She rides horses! She's had to have seen a freaking stream at some point. This character makes zero sense, and it's clear she's vastly under qualified for this mission.

{"text": "I received a copy of this book via Goodreads' Don't Buy My Love program in exchange for an honest review. \n Nick and Galen were on/off lovers, not exclusive, about 6 months prior. Nick wanted a commitment and Galen couldn't give him one, so he walked out. This isn't as heartless as it sounds. Galen had previously been in a serious relationship but his lover was killed in a car wreck with a drunk driver--while Galen was driving. Galen survived in body, but heart and spirit remain crushed even two years later--he still can't get behind the wheel without panic attacks. So, he wasn't ready to commit to another man, though he did feel that something promising had been building between them. \n At the point where the story begins, Galen 's art museum is prepping for a new exhibit and (astonishingly) he finds four bronze statues in the back of his storeroom. These four statues have no known provenance but they are clearly old and seem form a continuous exhibit, a nude warrior in four separate poses that suggest a missing mate. \n Stunned and overjoyed with his find, Galen immediately incorporates the statues into his new exhibit, but he also reached out to Nick--who is a an art fanatic and also an antiquities hunter. Nick knows all about the statues as it turns out--his family had OWNED them in the past but they were lost at sea decades ago. Nick had, in fact, been planning a dive to discover the wreckage. \n As it turns out, the statues have a curious history. They are all of Nick's ancient ancestor Dexios, and depict him awaiting the return of his missing lover, Lykos. Throughout history, these statues have been cared for--at times they have been completed. It seems the real Dexios was cursed to wait eternally for Lykos to return, and the only way for these lovers to be reunited is through reincarnation and reconnection. \n So, Nick's thought is HE is the Dexios and Galen must be Lykos. Galen is appropriately appalled--he's still not sure he can HAVE a relationship. Yet, the two (Galen and Nick) embark on a real relationship. They go on dates and begin to develop the kind of intimacy they had missed the first time round. It remained to be seen if this would reunite Dexios and Lykos, UNTIL THEY STARTED TAKING OVER THEIR BODIES!!! \n I really enjoyed this book. Such great emotional angst. So many stakes--not just can Galen get over his grief? Or, can Nick overcome his fear of abandonment? No, we also have mythology and magic interfering in ways designed to truly test the love and faith of both Galen and Nick. \n It was a slow burn, with tentative steps toward reconnection. Many times Nick, Galen, or both, had to slow the machinations of Lykos and Dexios. This was all to the good because they've waited hundreds of years to be together and failed several rounds of reincarnation. Smexytimes were well-written and steamy."}

The problem is, he doesn't remember anything before this moment, but he is pretty sure he's not a student and he doesn't know these people. But where did he come from, and why does everyone think hes been a student in the school for months? \n This book has 3 pov, so the story is told by Jason, Piper and Leo. I didn't enjoy that much, because I usually prefer one point of view. \n I felt I couldn't connect with Jason. He's lacking personality, and I felt him boring. What I loved about Percy was his sense of humor, his sarcasm and how warm and genuine he was. Jason was just a nice, stoic guy. \n What I enjoyed the most was seeing the camp again for the first time, seeing it with someone else's eyes. But I didn't really connect with the new characters, and I found myself just wanting to see more of the characters I already love. \n I thought the reveal was predictable, and that this book falls short to the first series of books.

{"text": "I'm probably biased, but I think this is an ace book. I can't believe I haven't read it since high school. \"Red Dwarf\" (along with Monty Python) was an integral part of my formative years, and was probably at least partly responsible for the distinctly British shape my sense of humour subsequently took. I still have a huge soft spot for the TV show, but in a lot of ways, the book is even better. Plots that are confined to half-hour episodes are here expanded upon, with more detail, more character insight, and more humour sprinkled throughout the narrative than the dialogue and visuals of the show alone could ever convey. One thing I can't believe I never noticed before: Lister is far and away the smartest character. Before, I just thought of him as a lazy, ignorant slob, who was the hero mainly by virtue of being nicer than everyone else. Yes, he is a lazy slob, but he's not stupid. He recognises when something is important, and he knows how to do the research and where to find the answers he needs. Rimmer, with his complex exam timetables, never seems to absorb 1% as much information as Lister does when he puts his mind to it. Rimmer is, of course, image-obsessed as a mask to hide his own self-loathing. The Cat is image-obsessed because of his own innate narcissism. Kryten lacks depth, but he's a mechanoid with few thoughts not about cleaning. Holly, the wonderfully eccentric computer, is good for a few one-liners. But Lister is the Everyman hero with a heart of gold, who never loses hope in the face of overwhelming odds that he will, one day, find his way home."}

{"text": "Lets just put this into perspective for you guys, I read the sample and then bought this book at around 3am this morning and I then finished it at 7am this morning. Damn, that was quick. I could not put it down. It was so captivating and such a light, easy and fun read. Who doesn't want to read about sirens and then to turn it into a sad perspective on them as well? I think Cass wrote this book beautifully and I just loved that it was a stand-alone. I needed a book with a happy ending since I've been stuck on the gruesome, A Song of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones), novels. This was much needed and I think you guys can tell how much I enjoyed this. \n It was a cool concept on the whole siren/mermaid type thing. We automatically start off with our main character in the 50s where she's 19, the richest family on the ship they're on and beautiful. Her and her family start to hear this beautiful song with these beautiful voices and all of a sudden everyone is going overboard willingly, jumping to their deaths. Kahlen has the sense to plug her ears but even then that is not enough. She does, however, have enough time to see her family jumping to their deaths as well, damn. Distraught by that and a moment of distraction the voices reach her head again and she, too, jumps overboard. After coming to sense, she realizes she hasn't even lived yet, she's 19 and she wants to get married, live a life, have children etc. Well that seems to be the call for help because then she is soon pulled out of the water and given the chance for a life where she will not age, not get hurt, and stay beautiful for however long the Ocean says. As long as Kahlen feeds the Ocean that is, with humans. Shipwrecks. See where this is going? It doesn't take a genius to know what she picked, so Kahlen then turns into this beautiful Siren and rather abruptly, we get to chapter 2 where it is 80 years later. Dun Dun Dun.... \n So Kahlen seems to be with new and young sirens now, in the present. She's almost like there leader seeing as she's the oldest siren they know, or rather live with. It was cool how Cass tried to justify that killing people for the deemed 'evilness' of the Ocean was something good and to kill 200 is to save billions type of argument. Also that the Ocean, whenever She is mentioned in anyway, has to be capitalized. It was almost like the Ocean is a real living thing with a mind of Her own, which in this book She was. She could speak to the sirens, give them hugs and warm their hearts. The thing I found interesting though, was that Kahlen loved Her. Like really really loved Her and adored Her. I couldn't get that seeing as it was the Ocean Herself that killed Kahlen's family and forced Kahlen to live for about 80 years isolated and killing people on shipwrecks. It was weird how the sentencing went as well. Kahlen had mention it was 80 years since she was 'reborn' and still had about 20 or so to go. That's 100 years of not speaking to any human, unless it's to sing for their death, and since we're on the topic, killing loads of people for the Ocean to eat. Kahlen of course then meets a boy whom she realizes that she may love and may want to live for. The Ocean doesn't like that and in a way, is jealous? Since it seemed that She only truly loved Kahlen out of all of Her sirens, which is interesting because the Ocean knows that if this boy sticks around She will lose the only one She truly cares about. \n This book was so cool and new!! I had never read anything remotely close to this type of fantasy and just the plot line in general. I really liked how different it was and it was a nice, easy and fun break from all of the other YA paranormal book series there are today. Really starting to like Kiera Cass's work now! \n IF you liked this review, check out more on my blog where I review YA and other genre books! \n http://keepcalmandloveboooks.blogspot.ca"}

{"text": "This book had an uncomfortable and bumpy start for me. I had so been looking forward to the four young mages getting back together and being one big happy family again, but it wasn't like that at all. I'll admit that Tammy's way of handling their reunion was much more realistic, but I hate seeing even fictional good friends not getting along. Besides that, in the first chapter, a year and a half goes by, during which the three travelers return to awkward and emotionally fraught homecomings. Daja learns she can no longer live at the temple, her former home, and refuses to live on Sandry's charity. Tris realises her three foster siblings are all incredibly wealthy, while her own prospects are poor, and her wind-scrying is driving her half mad. Briar has narrowly escaped a war, and is suffering deep emotional scars. Sandry, who has been waiting three years for all her friends to return, is deeply disappointed that none of them are eager to re-establish their former bond. But when Sandry's uncle approaches them to ask them to accompany Sandry to visit her lands in the empire of Namorn, they all agree to go. But they are unprepared to deal with Sandry's cousin, the powerful and beautiful empress of Namorn or the web she is weaving to keep them there. Our young friends are all grown up now, and there's no more skirting around the issue of sex. Briar is an unapologetic man-whore, Daja finds love in the arms of a beautiful woman, and Sandry is in constant danger of marriage-by-kidnap. Only Tris seems to keep aloof from the romantic shenanigans, but there are definitely budding Ron-and-Hermione overtones to her relationship with Briar. I had expected at least some of the students acquired in the last series to figure into this plot, but they are conspicuously absent. However, a man from Daja's travels resurfaces, turning out to be a mage driven mad by the power he never knew he had, and it will take all four of them to sort him out. Of course, by the end of the book they are all one big, happy family again, and it is very gratifying. The last time I read a book this long in a single day was the final Harry Potter book."}

{"text": "The series started off great but it's become tiresome. My biggest problem has to do with the fantasy elements that Flanagan promptly and inexplicably dropped after the first book.

They like coffee. And Horace eats a lot. Hilarious.). \n The fantasy angle would have at least given us a little variation in plot from book to book. \n There are a dozen other little things I could nitpick but I don't care enough. You might think I need to chill because it's a series written for kids but that doesn't excuse lazy storytelling, in my opinion. Kids deserve good fiction, too. \n I do still kind of like the characters but they are long past needing development apart from one another.

{"text": "I've just finished this book & all I can think of right now is a silent plea to the Almighty - \"Hey Mahadev, you blessed Amish with tremendous amount of inspiration to write a book like this. Perhaps, he could have done with some perspiration too, so he could have strived to write this book much better than it turned out to be.\" \n There, I said it. And that is the biggest grievance I have with Mr. Amish over his bestselling debut novel. \n I don't need to go over the plot (hell, all my friends in college who call themselves 'casual readers' had read this about a year back & had been telling me to read this ever since & then I finally borrowed the entire Shiva trilogy from a dear friend back in March in the middle of my university exams) & needless to say, Amish had a brilliant one on his hands. I'm no believer but you can't help being charmed by the Tibetan immigrant Shiva - the awe I felt as a kid when I read the Mahabharata & the Ramayana narrated in a style a la Amar Chitra Katha. The storytelling is decent too, given it is quite a page-turner. \n And that is where pretty much all the good things about it stop. The writing is a major let-down, for a story of this scope deserves a hell lot better prose than what Amish offers. No, don't even get started on how this is written in a modern style, the existing standards of Indian popular fiction, blah blah. When you have a story like this, you have to work hard enough to give it the writing it deserves. Barring a couple of well-written war scenes (verging on the epic & did give me a bit of gooseflesh) & a bit of the seeming allegory between Harappa & modern India when Shiva visits Ayodhya (I was impressed by that part), this book has inexplicably bad, lazy writing. Why does King Daksha seem to go around 'hugging' everyone 'tightly'? Why does everyone seem to 'guffaw loudly' (Jai Shri Siddhu!) when a slight grin seems to auffice for the amount of humour in that particular situation? Why does Shiva & every soul unrelated to him or his dear ones get teary-eyed in every other situation involving them? Like some of my friends would say, \"Kitna rota hai bey.\" (deriding someone for being too sentimental) \n There are two kinds of readers - one who prefer writing over plot & vice versa. I'm one who changes sides as I switch from literary to popular fiction, but I'm usually on the side of the latter esp. when it comes to popular fiction. But I'm unequivocal on the stand that even popular fiction should have an acceptable standard in terms of writing & that is somewhere Mr. Amish fails considerably. \n Still, if you can overlook the writing & focus only on plot, I do think there is a really captivating tale to be enjoyed here. I'm going with a rating of 3 to 3.5 stars for 'The Immortals of Meluha', the first book of the Shiva Trilogy by Amish Tripathi. Go for it if you're looking for a fast read, nothing more (given you haven't read it already)."}

It is creepy in a subtle way but is not horror, which I liked. There were dark and horrible aspects so don't think this book is entirely tame. It is everything I could have hoped it to be."}

{"text": "4.5 stars for The Delphi Effect!!! \n I must have to say, this story is MUCH BETTER than I thought at first. \n It's filled with the elements of si-fi, mystery, a little bit action, also having some paranormal power. I really enjoy with this book. Not only it has some brand new idea about paranormal story, but also brings me lots of excitement and fun. \n Anna Morgan is a teenage girl who has paranormal power of hearing some dead people whispering in her head. Sometimes there will some spirits stuck in her mind, just like Molly who was murdered by some cruel bad guy. As Anna knows more about the murder, she finds out she is getting close to the danger. And her adventure has begun! \n [Writing] \n This is my first time to read Rysa's work. \n I'm so surprise that her writing just make the story vivid. And she will add some humorous dialogues to make the plots be not that serious. Besides, I really like the way she mentions other famous books, movies or even TV series in the talk, letting me feel that I'm also standing there beside Anna and others. Won't feel any distance between me and the story. That's maybe why it's easy to get in to the story. \n \"Girl, you look like a poster for that Carrie movie.\" \n | This is one of my favorite quote from the book. LOL \n [Characters] \n Most of them are cute. \n I won't say that I'm crush on Aaron, and he is also my type. \n Actually, there are more things I can review for The Delphi Effect. \n I just need some time to update more details on it. :P \n To sum up, I really HAVE to get the next book RIGHT NOW!!! \n ***I got the e-ARC from NetGalley in exchange the honest review.

{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n I am so happy to be done with this book. I had really hoped that book two would be better then book one but that wasn't the case. Although book one was basically a rip off the Red Rising, I liked it more then this book. This book just kind of seemed like the divergent series or some other series that I can't pin point at the moment. I just feel like I've read a book with the same feel. The main characters \"relationship\" with Cal really annoys me because it just seems like they are using each other as comfort more then an actual relationship. (Spoiler Alert!) The fact that Shade died made me mad.*mentally flipping tables* His character seemed the most likable out of all characters even more then Mare's. It didn't really seem like she had much of a personality until 3/4 into the book. Towards the end of the book things finally started to pick up which its about time. I'm so happy to be done with this book though. I'll probably continue reading this series in hopes that it gets better but I still don't quite understand why this series is so popular."}
{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n I think I would have let the things that bothered me about this book slide if this was a new author, not an author I've read and really enjoyed before. \n As others have said, the world building was just one giant pile of HUH? Nothing was explained, it was just thrown out there. I really enjoyed Cami, I found her a nice change from most main characters who are written to appear tough as nails but do nothing but make terrible choices and endanger everyone around them. Cami was self aware enough to know her limits. \n Not going to lie, I found the romance part of this book reeeeeally confusing. There's the step brother who is more and the supposed stranger who actually turns out to be some kind of brother. Both gave her tingly feelings. Both really border on the weird. \n This book is like a movie you've been anxiously awaiting to see in theatre. You finally get there, you watch. While its on you think its fantastic, you're completely engrossed, but when the lights come on and you leave, you realize the actual movie was not that great, it was merely the experience that you enjoyed."}
{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n I didn't read The Time Traveler's Wife. The synopsis never struck me as something I really wanted to read and I couldn't get into it. I can't decide if that was a good or bad thing. Probably good, because from the reviews, a lot of people went into reading Her Fearful Symmetry on the heels of Time Traveler's Wife and expected it to be similar. It apparently wasn't. I also didn't know the two books were written by the same author-- this book came recommended by two different people in two different circles of friends. I picked it up on a whim and started reading it. I find the best books that way! \n This story begins oh, so right. Niffenegger (you mind if I call her Audrey? That name is a toughie)jumps right into the middle of the story and wades around in it. Our main character, you see... dies on Page One. And I figure if someone dies on Page One, there's a good reason for it and a good story behind it. \n This novel is the story of two sets of twins: Edie and Elspeth, and Edie's twin daughters Julia and Victoria. For reasons not given until nearly the end of the book, Edie and Elspeth are estranged. Have been for nearly twenty years. Elspeth's terminal illness does not change this. Elspeth lives in London, in a flat above her 13 year companion Robert. Edie, her husband Jack and the twins live in the States. \n When Elspeth dies, she leaves her flat, all of her belongings and her money to the twins, with the stipulation that they have to live in the flat for a year before they can sell it. And that their parents, Edie and Jack, must never set foot in it. Her papers and diaries are removed, property of Robert. No one is to see them. Robert avoids reading them until absolutely necessary. \n The twins are 20, but are small and thin and alarmingly co-dependent. Victoria is a mirror image of Julia, down to the beauty mark on her cheek. Victoria is weak, with a heart defect and severe asthma. Julia delights in taking care of Victoria, a constant companion. Victoria is the more artistic and fashionable one. She creates and sews and makes her own clothing. Julia is the smart one, the healthy and strong one. The trade-off, Julia thinks, isn't fair. Victoria is the pretty one, despite their being twins. Julia is envious of the attention Victoria receives without even trying and insists on clinging to her. They have to do everything together. One cannot attend school without the other. One cannot work without the other. Both are still virgins because...what one does, the other must also. The suffocation is palpable. \n Moving to London begins to change the lives of the twins in ways they could never plan for, or imagine. They meet other characters and cast members in Elspeth's life-- Martin, the OCD genius who lives upstairs, who showers three times a day and is compelled to scrub the floor for hours and stacks his life in plastic bins around his apartment, whose wife loves him more than life itself, but left him to have a life of her own. Robert, who lives downstairs, who avoids the twins like the plague when they arrive, whose sorrow over the loss of Elspeth is driving him mad, daily, who thinks he feels her presence, in her flat. Her ghost seems to haunt the place, knocking books over and pushing paperclips around and stirring curtains. \n As the girls begin to enjoy life in London, their relationship begins to change. A bigger world means more opportunity, more to explore, more to do. Their interests begin to divide. They bicker and the threads that once tied them together start to unravel. Robert meets the girls and it takes his breath away how much Victoria resembles Elspeth. More than he wants to, he likes her. He can't help but approach her and want to be near her. But there is the issue of missing Elspeth. \n Who isn't really missing, at all. She is there, in the flat. Stuck in the spirit world, as an energy. Haunting them until she's able to find a way to let them all know she's there. Using a crudely concocted OUIJA board and later a pencil and paper, the girls finally meet their Aunt Elspeth-- if only after death. There are questions yet unanswered and mysteries yet unsolved. \n Why didn't Edie and Elspeth talk? Why did Elspeth leave her worldly goods to two girls she had never met? Why couldn't their parents visit, and why couldn't the girls read her diaries? \n SECRET, Elspeth says. Oh. And a secret it is! \n There are so many elements to this story, and one- no, two!-amazing plot twists. I do so love a plot twist! So many interwoven story lines, existing on their own course until they converge. The twins are the crux... everything else, everyone else are like the spokes of a wheel. \n There are three parts to this story, each equally intriguing, but I don't think that all are weighed equally. Part One begins slowly, unfurling the tale, lazy in its reveal, raising more questions than it answers. Part Two is full of change and discovery and adventure and drama and mystery, a tearing a part and a putting back together and a horrid plan that NO ONE should agree to, but all involved, unfortunately, do. \n Part Three is the carrying out of said plan. And the backfire. And the end result. Part three made me gasp, made my eyes bug out, made my heart ache. And the end made me shake my head and say, 'well that's what you get, now isn't it?' \n For the writers in the room, I think what was most off-putting actually was the third person omniscient. The reader reads what everyone is doing, thinking, feeling. I found this POV to be really confusing. Perhaps the story would have been more gripping if we weren't so privy to everything. A little mystery adds a lot. Make me guess, don't tell me everything. Even simple third person might have made it a tad easier to understand, but I got it figured out, so I guess it wasn't that bad. \n There are some twists in this book that I still sort of don't understand, involving the decades long estrangement between Edie and Elspeth. I think I'll have to read it again soon, concentrating on that part, to understand it better. Overall I really enjoyed the book. Part Three, especially is un-put-down-able! \n It doesn't make me want to read Time Traveler's Wife, though."}
{"text": "I didn't know anything about this book when I picked it from the stack... so glad I decided to get it and take a chance on it. I was craving something light and wonderful and this definitely hit the spot. \n The town of Mullaby is a small, southeastern town full of polite charm and a little bit of magic. Sixteen year old Emily has been sent there to live with her grandfather after the death of her mother. Right away, she learns that her mother was not always a fine, upstanding citizen. Rather, she had quite the reputation. \n Emily meets her grandfather, a giant of a man as harmless as a butterfly. He is shy, avoids people and crowds, has a hard time fitting in-- Emily knows how he feels. So does Julia, resident cake baker and owner of the local barbecue restaurant. Her return to Wallaby just a few short years prior dredged up a lot of old memories-- namely Sawyer, a boy she once loved and was torn from, with whom she shares a large secret. \n And then there is the strangeness. The Mullaby Lights that only glow in the night, the \"sweet sense\" that Sawyer seems to have, the sparkle that follows Julia around.... there are a lot of mysteries in Mullaby, for such a quiet little town."}

So, if you happen to be Lucifer's youngest son, the only way to go is good. \n Jinx is, in fact, so fantastically good that his dad has threatened to pack him off to demon military academy to learn wrong from right. Jinx runs away and fantastic adventures ensue. \n But I don't want this to sound like your run-of-the-mill MG. For a start it's set in Hell. Jinx and sidekick human Tommy (who has been sent down below for accidentally killing her evil uncle), and in fact all the characters, are hilarious and refreshingly unique, and will appeal to both kids and parents. \n But what I liked best about it is that, while it's accessible, Tatum Flynn doesn't dumb down for her audience; the writing and plot are satisfyingly, though appropriately, complex, there's a liberal sprinkling of mythology in there, and its all wrapped up in humour so sharp it could give you a paper cut. \n All in all proving that the Devil doesn't just have the best tunes, sometimes he has the best books too."}
{"text": "Definitely a fluff read...a little unbelievable but fun all around."}
{"text": "I can't even explain how excited I was to find this book. I love PNR and I really love historical romance. I was so sure this book was going straight to my favorites list. Not so much. \n I love the concept. Vampires that exist peacefully and secretly among the ton. There are Lords of different cities in England (and other countries as well, I'm sure), all part of a vampire hierarchy. There are vampire hunters as well. These are all good things, they were just executed terribly. \n The conflict is centered around Dr. Polidori and his newly published book about a vampire, sparking an interest around England in vampires. Now the actual vampires are worried about being discovered. One way for the vampire Lord of London to throw off suspicion of his vampirism is to take a mortal English bride. Plus, he wants to sleep with her. Win-win. \n What didn't work for me was the lack of explanation of the vampire world. We learn only what Angelica asks. If she's not curious about it, we don't learn about it. And I had a lot of unanswered questions. And the flying? What? How high does he fly? How does that work? Why the hell wasn't Angelica freaked out? It's not like she's used to being in planes. This was the first time in her life she was off the ground. It bordered on bizarre. \n We learn that vampires also have random talents (such as flying and mind reading). Angelica was not surprised by any of them. Her responses to learning certain people had these traits basically translated into \"Oh you can read my mind? Nifty! You can fly? Cool!\" It was completely unbelievable. Especially for a woman in the early 19th century. \n The romance was underwhelming. For some reason, Angelica's behavior and way of speaking reminded me of Alice from Alice in wonderland. She found wondering in everyhing little thing. Everything was fascinating. She loved defying expectation just for shit and giggles. She was always overly enthusiastic. She giggled a lot. Basically, she had this childlike wonder about everything, even sex. Anything childlike, even wonder, is not sexy. I would have believed she was 14 if her age was never mentioned. Which isn't that far off for 19th century England, but for this book, it just made me uncomfortable. She was incredibly immature. Her love of reading and writing books came off as an easy way to make her seem more mature so that a man that has been alive for centuries would find her more attractive than other beautiful women. Think Belle from Beauty and the Beast. Except she's 12. \n I'm tempted to pick another from the series and try again. Sometimes the first book in a series, especially of a genre as different as this one, can take a book or two to establish itself. I think that was the most frustrating thing about this book. It had the potential to be amazing. I probably did myself a disservice going into this book with such high hopes. And if I'm honest, the first book in a romance series isn't usually my favorite. The more the characters have time to develop by appearing in each book, the more attached I get and more emotionally invested I become. I can't really recommend this book, but I'm not swearing off the whole series."}
{"text": "Crosspost:mytokyoblues.wordpress.com \n \"I have a gift that is, as far as I have found, unique to me. It allows me to see truth where others see illusion - and there are many illusions, so many masks and facades. All the world's a stage, as they say, and I seem to have the only seat in the house with a view behind the curtain.\" - Jackaby \n I won an advanced reader's copy of the novel through a goodreads giveaway. For anyone interested in buying the book, it goes on sale September 16, 2014. Winning a free book did not influence my opinions. \n The Cover:Did anyone feel the cover? It's so soft and it feels very different from your typical paperback. I loved the cover of the novel, it was quite beautiful. I loved the details of the cover such as the woman in red. It is one of my favorite covers of 2014. \n The Plot:Abigail Rook is not your typical Victorian socialite, she seeks adventure and travel, and would rather get her hands dirty be seeking a husband to maintain her. She arrives to New England after having a disappointing experience excavating dinosaurs. Abigail seeks a employment right away because she is in need of money and meets Jackaby, her future employer who is a detective. The people of New Fiddleham view Mr. R.F. Jackaby as a maniac since he deals with the supernatural. Naturally, he is talented in his work, he is compassionate and kind to supernatural creatures. The duo works together in order to solve the mysterious murders in New Fiddleham with some help from the police force. \n The Characters:Abigail definitely proved that she was not your stereotypical girl, she worked hard for her job. Jackaby, I had no complaints about his character. For some reason, I kept imagining Matt Smith as Jackaby because he reminded me of the eleventh doctor. At the same time, Jackaby really reminded me of Sherlock since he sees what others can't see. Then there is Charlie Cane, who I thought was adorable, I thought he was human until the middle of the book. The side characters were great, I would have loved it if Jenny the ghost had a bigger backstory, the same going for Douglas the duck. \n The Villain: I knew it! I loved how he was a creature rather than a person! \n The Romance: Thank the heavens that there was no love triangle in this novel. It would have ruined the novel for me that is. I didn't not like how some of the characters in the novel tried to ship Jackaby and Abigail, I did roll my eyes during those parts. Jackaby and Abigail make an awesome team, I loved their friendship. The only two characters that developed some feelings for each other were Abigail and Charlie Cane. I did want to them together, but it's okay that they did not become a couple. \n I would like to see the author wrote more stories about Jackaby. The novel is relatively easy to read and it is only 299 pages long. I would recommend this novel for anyone wanting to read a short mystery book with a hint of fantasy. For a standalone novel, I thought it was really good and I would really love more of Jackaby's adventures. \n My rating is a 4 out of 5 :D"}

{"text": "Librarians. Secret societies. Books. Spies. Adventure. Alternate universes. Vampires and werewolves. Victorian London. Dragons. Time Traveling. \n All of these things separately are things I love and the thought of combining them is a bit nerve-racking. After all, there are so many elements and none of them really related that something, somewhere will get lost, but that doesn't happen with the Invisible Library. The Invisible Library tackles the tough task of combining these elements into a book that is not only a delightful read, but probably one of my favorites for the year. \n The Invisible Library tells the story of a secret society of librarians that have committed themselves to 'The Library'. Upon becoming an agent of The Library, or essentially a Librarian, these individuals vow to work on missions that involve heading to alternate realities (some of which are considered 'chaos filled' which means that magic and reality combine to create a chaotic situation) and retrieving rare/unique copies of books. Unfortunately, retrieving these rare books isn't always an easy task. \n The Invisible Library follows the story of Irene, a young professional spy/agent for The Library. She - along with a novice by the name of Kai - are given the task of retrieving a rare book from an alternate London that has vampires, werewolves, Fae, and advanced steampunk like inventions. The task seems easy enough, until they get to the new universe and discover that they are not the only people looking for the book and one of those people is a man that was thought to be an urban legend amongst The Librarians. \n Kai and Irene spend most of the book looking for clues and trying to sort out who has the book, who is an ally, who is an enemy, and what is going on political wise with The Library. They also trying to solve a mystery, find the book, beat a \"bad guy\", and learn more about each other. \n I absolutely loved The Invisible Library. It is pretty much everything I look for in a book. It has action, adventure, mystery, and books - lots and lots of books. Even though The Invisible Library is a favorite of mine and I enjoyed it, it is far from a perfect book. I'll highlight some of my favorite aspects of the book and talk about some of the aspects that didn't really work for me. \n A huge highlight of The Invisible Library is the way Genevieve Cogman weaves so many seemingly unique concepts into one coherent story. There are a lot of elements that could come across as disjointed or random, but it all comes together nicely. \n Another aspect I found enjoyable was the way Genevieve Cogman was able to take a familiar world and give it a unique twist. Everyone knows what Victorian London is/was like, but the Victorian London we were introduced to in the book was new and unique. It felt different, which is what added to the excitement of the book. \n One of the things I found a bit frustrating about The Invisible Library was some of the seemed felt awkward or a bit out of character. The scene that comes to mind is within the first 25% of the book when Kai and Irene are forced to spend a night together in a hotel that resides in their alternate London. Kai mysterious, and what feels a bit out of character, starts throwing himself at Irene. He asks if she wants to sleep with him and feels hurt when she rejects it. \n Previously, there had been no indication that Kai had any romantic feelings for Irene. The two had just met a few short hours before. It just seemed out of place. \n Another aspect of The Invisible Library that felt awkward was the way the world was introduced. Instead of going for a complete info dump that involved explaining how The Library worked, how alternate universes worked, the role of the Librarians and supernatural creatures, and who the bad guys were, Genevieve Cogman goes for a more 'learn while you read approach'. \n The learn while you read approach is great, as it speeds up the book. You aren't bogged down by lengthy descriptive paragraphs, but it sometimes makes you feel like you missed something. There were times when I was like 'who is this' or 'what is this', only to discover that we hadn't learned about it yet and would learn the answer to that question several chapters later. \n I will admit that The Invisible Library isn't overly complex. It isn't overly simple either, but if you are looking for something extremely detailed, it probably wouldn't be this book. The main focus of the book isn't in creating overly detailed characters, but in the world building and adventure. The characters develop throughout the book, but it is clear that isn't the main focus of the book. \n Even though The Invisible Library isn't a perfect book, it is an enjoyable one. Immediately upon finishing it I had two things in mind. First, I wanted to become a Librarian. I mean who wouldn't want to be a time traveling spy who is on a mission to save rare books. Second, I couldn't wait for the second book. \n Overall, The Invisible Library is a fun easy read. While the main plot might - to some - seem predicable, the unique world building and action more than make up for it. This is a definite must read for any book lover."}
{"text": "Set in the decadent French court of Versailles during the reign of Louis XIV - a period in history I'm particularly interested in - The Moon and the Sun felt like a novel I should have really liked. However as indicated by two-star rating, this just didn't make the cut. \n The premise of The Moon and the Sun is not your standard historical fiction novel as it's blended with elements of science fiction. The story follows Marie-Josephe de la Croix, a young woman fresh out of the convent who has come to court as an attendant in the household of the Duke of Orleans, the King's brother. Her brother Yves is a natural philosopher and a new favourite of the King since - and this is where the sci-fi kicks in - he has just returned from a voyage in which he has brought back with him a sea monster/mermaid whose flesh possesses the ability to grant immortality. Louis XIV gets totally hooked on this idea and plans to cook and eat the mermaid (it's referred to as a sea creature in the novel, but I'm going to carry on calling it a mermaid, because that's essentially what it is) once Yves has finished with his research. This plan becomes not so straight forward when Marie-Josephe is put in charge of taking care of the mermaid, and she comes to realise that it is more human than she initially believed. \n In a nut shell, that is the novel. Granted, it does exactly what it says on the tin, no beating around the bush, but the fact is I just didn't care for the story. There were a few little twists and revelations concerning the truth about certain characters gene pools, but they were mentioned pretty whimsically without adding any depth to the plot, as though they were just thrown in last minute. \n As a central character, Marie-Josephe is at times painfully irritating. She's a pretty smart cookie: she studies maths, composes music, expresses an interest in the works of Isaac Newton, all in addition to her somehow possessing the ability to communicate with the mermaid.. How? It's never really explained; she just kind of wakes up one morning and is able to translate and understand everything the sea monster says. \n I should be happy that the novel focuses on a smart female character during a period where women's education was limited to learning how to draw and play the piano (which by the way, Marie-Josephe can also do). Maybe I would be if Marie-Josephe was a likeable character, but her intelligence is outweighed by her boringly repetitive dialogue and absolute naivety about the facts of life. I know she's spent time cooped up in a convent but good God, if she can be up to date in the scientific developments of understanding gravity, then how can she be so dense as to not understand anything about sex, or what the word \"whore\" means? \n Also, she is forever apologising to Count Lucien, the King's adviser, for saying something she believed to be inappropriate or insulting in his presence. Most of the time she just over thinks absolutely everything because whatever it was she said that she believed worthy of an apology can't have been that bad, because it never stuck in my mind long enough to remember what she was saying sorry for. Girl, just chill. \n She's not the only one. Her brother Yves is an insufferable dickhead most of the time who constantly orders Marie-Josephe around. Our beloved protagonist of course never calls him out on his dickish ways and is forever - again - apologising for being such a let down. There's a scene early in the story where Marie-Josephe forgets to wake Yves up one morning, which causes him to miss the King's Awakening Ceremony which he was personally invited to and is apparently a pretty big deal, so he tells her himself once he finally drags his arse out of bed. Dude, this is your problem, stop being so whinny and relying on your little sister to do everything for you. \n There's also a love story brewing throughout, but the writing and the fact that the love story involved Marie-Josephe meant that I no longer cared once things finally got steamy. And by steamy I mean, holding hands and having an awkward smooch in the back of a carriage. Sexy. \n If the historical and science fiction collab is something you're interested in then this might be your thing. The only parts of the novel I actually liked were the lavish descriptions of the French Court, but sadly even that wasn't enough to save this for me. \n This review was originally posted on my blog: Chapters by Amy"}

Though, a quick kiss at the Jingle Bells Ball sets each man examining if they could possibly become...more. \n Blitzen doesn't want to hurt his friendship with Cupid, but Cupid has even darker reasons for not pursuing his best pal: he's not exactly a Christmas Elf. His mother was a winter faery, but his father? Dockalfar--the dark elves that instigated the Frost Wars centuries ago. Dockalfar aren't welcome in North Pole City, and would never be accepted as a Rein Dear. Or, so Cupid believes. When his elder brother turns up to wreak mischief and mayhem and ruin Cupid's happy existence. That Cupid and Blitzen are just beginning to explore the love burgeoning between them is mighty inconvenient. \n This novella is mostly sweet with a bit of sad. Cupid doesn't want to harm his brother, but he can't let the man destroy North Pole City. Nor can he face being shunned by Blitzen. I liked how his double-life, as it were, gets smoothed out, and we get the introduction of two potential couples for future stories: Dasher and the King of Frost, and Cupid's other brother, Calder, with Donner. There's a couple steamy moments, and a lot of love sprinkled within this sweet novella package. I find the series enchanting--and Christmas magical."}

{"text": "I liked this book but I was disappointed at how short it was compared for the first book. There was some more world building in here that I really enjoyed but I wish there was more. I felt like this book was lacking in substance compared to the first book too. I mean, if GotG had too much crammed in there, then this book definitely had too little. I liked Justin and Mae's development but I was kind of put off by Mae's rape . The ending however, literally made me go, \"What?!\" out loud. And it really explains the aforementioned spoiler better. Mae's much more likable (at least to me) in this book. I thought Tessa's scenes were tedious and boring compared to Justin and Mae's povs, however. Interesting to see where the plot goes in the third book, hopefully there will be more world building!"}

{"text": "I've listened to over three hours of this audio book, and I'm at the point where I'm only enjoying it because the narrator, Kate Reading, has a great reading voice. Other than that, I just don't care. There are sort of aliens, souls without bodies, 'seekers,' 'healers,' and other things about which I couldn't give a flying fig. There's the mediocre writing of the Twilight series books without the tension or action. I'm going to abandon this and have absolutely no guilty feeling about it (although I'm slightly irritated b/c I spent two audible credits on it). Tonight on the train, I turned it off and opted to listen to my stand-by David Sedaris, Live at Carnegie Hall, even though I've listened to it at least five times. But at least Sedaris is reliably entertaining. I've even created an entire shelf inspired by the Meyer book! So, read it at your own peril. Or, simply at your own guaranteed boredom."}
{"text": "Check out my other book reviews at my blog; The Title Page \n I read Eragon when I was 15. And again when I was 17. Then again when I was 21. \n The moment I opened this book, it whisked me away. Picture Lord of the Rings, but YA. God knows, I've read Lord of the Rings enough times, but when I was younger, getting through that book was like getting through my long period American History class where I had a blind teacher. Droning, really. \n LOTR is amazing, but it's a lot to take in for a kid. Thus, my relationship with Eragon was born. \n Eragon is a poor farmer's nephew, born of unknown legacy. He finds a mystical egg that contains his new dragon and life partner, Saphira. \n Saphira is one of two that we know of living dragons in the land of Alagaesia. The other is paired with the evil king of Alagaesia. Madness ensues, and Eragon is left alone with his dragon, everyone he cares about and every worldly possession stripped from him. He sets off to fight the Empire (very Star War's, amIrite?) alongside an old storyteller from his village. \n This books tells the story of his journey, his finally joining the allied forces fighting the evil king, and his first entry into battle. \n I enjoyed the first of the quartet of books the most, as most people usually do. It was full of adventure and magic. The other three focus more on war and battles, not my cup of tea. \n I don't consider Eragon a rip off of LOTR. Yeah, it's another world with different languages used throughout the novel. And it has it's share of mythical creatures. It's got the war for control of the land, with one main protagonist holding the key for the good guy's victory. \n For as much as Paolini struggles with originality, he makes up for it with the imagination and skill with which he fleshed out this magical world. \n Everything is completely thought out. This is one series I've read where there are no loose ends. You're never left wondering. And after you're done with all four novels, you are left feeling completely satisfied. (hehe, maturity glitch) \n Eragon is also a coming of age story. I strongly related to Eragon as a teen when I first read this. Living out your normal life, waiting for something extraordinary to happen. No, I didn't grow the standard main character crush on him like I did with Fred Weasley I'm still heartbroken , I saved that for Murtagh upset about his fate as well who is a supporting character in the novel. \n Paolini does a great job world building as well as character building. I could feel the different character's personalities. I had an emotional attachment to each character through the novel. \n I recommend this book for: sci-fi fans, dragon lovers, and LOTR fans. \n Favorite character: Murtagh and Saphira \n Least favorite character: The Twins \n P.S. The author is quite an artist too. Love his work."}
{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n I haven't has as visceral an experience with an audiobook since I listened to Scott Smith's The Ruins. I spent the first half of this book getting to know a dozen likable, eclectic characters and the second half yelling at the car radio and gripping the steering wheel like it was a cut glass doorknob and I was swinging into space. \n The story works on a few different levels, and they're pretty much all successful. The characters living in the Kavach building (or at least the ones we're introduced to; I don't agree with Clines's decision to add more names of residents we haven't met. Why not just limit it to those playing a role in the story?), are relatable and layered in mysteries of their own. The Kavach building is certainly a mystery to be solved, but I had no clue as to what was waiting for me on the other side of room 14. Clines's story is a bit of House of Leaves, a dash of hard science fiction, and just enough fantasy (the squales, good god, the squales) to scare the pants off of me. \n I scanned a review that was likening it to Lost, and while I loved the first couple seasons of that show, I think it would be a disservice to compare 14 to something that wasn't well thought through. Clines has a nice complexity without being overly contrived, and it's clear from the beginning that he knows exactly where he is (and you are) going, even if you don't have a clue. It's his ride, and I loved being on it. \n The narrator, Ray Porter, was great. He worried me during the first ten minutes--I thought he might a little too Hollywood. But he was actually perfect and did great voices for a variety of characters, some with accents. \n Read this and have a damn good time."}
{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n I would have given this three stars, but the last forty pages are so bad that when it came time to rate it I was still pissed off. \n Overall, this book is a mess. Some sections are really good. There's definitely some good tension and a creepy air of mystery throughout the first two-thirds. Other sections really needed some more time with the editor; there were many spots where it wasn't clear who was speaking. \n Finally, the characters I loved so much in the first book really pissed me off in this one. Decker is completely mentally abusive to Delaney throughout the entire thing, AND SHE LETS HIM. Even when she \"calls him out\", the next scene it's back to the old routine. He's a completely toxic asshole for a large part of the book, even when he's being \"nice\", and it feels like the author wasn't even aware. He slut-shames Delaney for her Halloween costume while they're broken up, and this leads directly to them getting back together (WTF). The entire book is Decker getting a pass on being a dick and running around playing detective and shaming people for not living up to his standards. It's awful. Several (all?) female characters are painted with some really ugly, tired stereotypes (slut, dumb slut, unworthy girlfriend, cute sweet girl-next-door who will forgive anything, etc). I guess one could argue that it's because this book is told from a high school senior boy's perspective, but that just adds to my argument that Decker is a fucking asshole, and it definitely makes the book less than it could have been. \n As far as the actual mystery goes, there's one part that you'll probably have figured out pages and pages before the rest of the characters, one red herring that really jars with the rest of the story and ends up being what I felt was a loose end that never got tied up, and the rest you'll never be able to figure out ahead of time because characters are behaving so non-sensically that there's no way you would guess it was them, or understand why anyone does what they do. The storytelling and logic is so flimsy in spots that it's hard to believe an editor ever even looked at this. It's extremely frustrating. \n Rating: 2.5/5, docked an extra .5 for that abysmal final act. Not a worthy sequel."}

{"text": "Crosspost:TheReadingBelle.com \n I don't know how to quite describe Withering Rose. Let me first start off by saying that it's the second book in the series, but you don't have to read the first book since the stories are standalone, but interconnected. \n Alright, so when I saw that Withering Rose was available on Netgalley, I wanted to read it so, so badly. The synopsis is what won me over. I've read a couple of Beauty and The Beast retellings and I was in the mood to read another one. I was hoping that Withering Rose was going to be the \"one\". Oh, I was wrong. \n I hated it. I've been going through a reading slump, and this book did not help whatsoever. I can't believe I actually managed to finish reading it, because it felt like I was reading this book for months. So, the story begins with a huge earthquake as Omorose and her father are traveling to another kingdom. They find themselves transported to another world because of the earthquake, in a world without magic. Omorose is forced to keep her powers hidden because the people of her new world exterminate magical beings. Modern earth hates anything magical. In a way, present day earth can be viewed as a dystopian society in the eyes of Omorose and her father. \n Her father has to work for the government in order for his and Omorose's survival. As years go by, Omorose feels caged because she cannot use her powers. Her father forbids her from using her magic because he wants to protect her. He doesn't want his daughter to be slaughter, but Omorose feels that by hiding her magic, she is hiding herself. Her classmates see her as the weird girl, and she hates living a second life of pretending to be someone she is not. She decides it is best to leave her father and pursue the beast. (It's not like her father has been protecting her for years from their enemies.) The beast is a magical being that lives deep in the forest. The government has been trying to capture the beast and end magic, but his whereabouts are unknown. \n The world building sucked. Completely sucked. There is no explanation on how two worlds ended up merging. It happens in the span of one chapter, the very first chapter may I add. There is no world building for Omorose's home world. As the reader, you are left wondering what kind of world did she come from. I thought of a medieval setting, but that's just me. I feel that if her world was based on the past, let's say the 5th century, and somehow it merged to modern day earth, it would have been a better explanation. Anyways, the kingdoms of Omorose's home world get transported onto modern day earth, and merge with cities. The government has been fighting off the magical users. There is no reason why there is discrimination. As you reader, you are left to assume that the present day earth is very advanced when it comes to the technology. \n As for the characters, I didn't love them. I had no attachments to the protagonist, love interest, nor secondary characters. Omorose was conflicting for me because she describes herself as strong, but honestly, she was weak for me. Her magical ability is cool. She is able to grow flowers, and every time she uses her magic, it takes a toll on her body. You would think that Omorose would be thankful for being able to survive on earth. Honestly, he father was protecting her life by forbidding her magic, but no. Unnecessary angst. Now moving on to the beast, he's a shape-shifter and is a prince. He is angry and brooding, and isn't lovable. Omorose and her relationship with the Beast happened instantly. At first, Omorose is completely terrified of the Beast, and he does nothing to prove her otherwise. And then, they instantly fall in love. I wasn't a huge fan of their romance. \n After finishing Withering Rose, I won't pick up the other books in the series. I liked the concept, but the execution wasn't the best. Personally, I wouldn't recommend this book. A frustrating Beauty and the Beast retelling is not what I needed. I can recommend picking up A Court of Thorns And Roses by Sarah J. Maas or Beastkeeper by Cat Hellisen. \n Final Rating: [?][?]"}

I think the book originally came out in serial form, as it was broken down into short stories or capers. Kind of reminded me of Sherlock Holmes - another favorite of mine. \n Examining robots also gave a canvas for defining what it is to be human. I loved the robot religion story. Robots with a superiority complexes - but thank goodness for that first law or it would be a Terminator-style story. \n According to Asimov's predictions, in 2009 the robot revolution should be in full swing. But I don't see a lot of robots around. Anyone have a good prediction on where we are with robots? When will we have pet robots and robot laborers?"}

{"text": "I was disappointed. As a big fan of the Throne of Glass series, I expected this to be quite good, but truth be told I was bored the whole way through. The characters are boring, the plot isn't really engaging, the whole masks thing is, I think, stupid - as if the author had strained herself to think of a curse that was inconvenient enough to need lifting but not so bad as to make her character(s) unattractive. The entire length of the book, the plot felt a little shoddy and unstable, some things weren't quite right and didn't make sense - while some of it was explained in later revelations, it doesn't justify it, and more effort could have gone into tidying up the plot and its loose ends. \n Admittedly it wasn't all bad: a few things strike me as noteworthy. Lucian, for one, who, with his eye-rolling and groaning at the protagonists' gross lovey-dovey-ness, does a good job representing the reader (to paraphrase a friend). \n Nesta, fierce Nesta and her awesome character arc. That was good. I want to read a series about Nesta, not Faye. \n That scene with the dirty verses composed to teach Faye how to read. Unexpectedly fun - perhaps the only scene where I actually like Whatshisface (I'm not even joking. I don't even remember his name, that's how indifferent he left me). \n And finally, that scene where Faye traps that creature and then saves its life - not only common courtesy, strangely unusual in that genre of books, but also a welcome attempt at un-demonizing non-human creatures in YA fiction. \n That said, all in all, I spend most of the book reading on, expecting it to finally get exciting. It didn't."}

{"text": "First off, the setting of this book was a nice change compared to other books. I feel like there aren't that many YA books set in Russia but I could be wrong. This book was an easier read then I thought it would be. The whole aspect of this story is for each player to \"make a move\" and I had thought this book would of gone all Hunger Games on me but it didn't. About half way through there is an undeniable love triangle but it's more one sided so not as much of a triangle but I still thought it would of turned for the worst. Also, the book became so much more \"fluffier\" then I expected. I also didn't expect the book to have \"The Mummy\" (movie) aspect at all. With this aspect, I thought everything was going to go down hill from there. But it didn't. One thing led to another and towards the end I couldn't put the book down. I was satisfied with the ending especially with a slight cliffhanger at the end. I'll for sure be looking forward to reading the next book in this series."}
{"text": "There's some cool stuff in this book but the whole is much less than the sum of its parts. I am so frustrated by the unrealized potential displayed here. Gaiman has a great premise, some fantastic imagery and top notch descriptive writing, some potentially fascinating characters, and he strands them in a meandering mess of poor plotting, bad pacing and undercooked world building. Shadow is boring. The focus on Shadow's perspective and experiences to the detriment of other characters is foolish. Gaiman would have been much better off focusing more on the thoughts and feelings and unique perspectives of the gods themselves. Most of the gods pop up sporadically rather than being consistent parts of the narrative, giving the book a very disjointed feeling. There is a curious lack of momentum to the plot, and the stakes never feel high. This just lacks drive and tension. Ultimately it all feels flat and not epic in the slightest. There are the bones of a much more interesting book than what Gaiman actually delivered here. \n Reading this book is like watching an incredibly gifted student flunk out of school because he won't do his work. You can see flashes of brilliance here that tease you into believing this book is going to be something magical, and then the failure to deliver becomes so frustrating. I expected so much more from this book. I thought it would have more to give me. To call it bad would be an overstatement, but it is disappointing for sure."}

I didn't really care for the main character Tayna I thought she was a bit slow to get things and purposely dragged events out so the book was longer. \n The events were a bit choppy at times in that they didn't flow. This was a main problem in that it was a debut and some of these things takes time to get through but it will be ironed out with time. \n I can't wait for the sequel! Harrison has a lot of talent and the world that she created was really gritty and dark for a child's book."}

{"text": "Blegh. This book had lovely prose and absolutely nothing else to offer a reader. I kind of resent the pretty writing actually because without it I might have just abandoned this narrative train wreck instead of trudging through it. \n The protagonist Morgana is mute from trauma. This is a contrivance that fails in several ways. The romance between Morgana and blandly perfect Cai is super dull and unconvincing because of the lack of communication between them. I never got a good sense of what Cai saw in Morgana and Cai isn't well developed enough to be a proper romantic lead. \n Even more frustratingly I feel like Morgana's muteness was a gimmick included to add complications to what is ultimately a painfully simplistic plot. If Morgana could talk this would be a twenty page short story. The sections of the book relayed in first person from Morgana's perspective read nothing like how you would expect a person so emotionally disturbed as to be rendered mute for years and years to be. Nothing about Morgana felt authentic. \n The villains are also awful one dimensional mustache twirlers who are melodramatic and stupid in the way cartoon villains are. None of the characterizations are complex here. Everything about this book is very flat and juvenile. \n This paper thin plot and these anemic characters are not rich enough to sustain a novel. Don't be suckered in by the stylistic skill shown by the author like I did. This author's first book, the Witch's Daughter, is very good however. Read that instead if this author intrigues you."}

{"text": "Anger's Children by K. D. Rose is collection of three short stories. Judging this book or writing its review is particularly hard, since I hated one of the stories, loved another and one remained in between like and dislike. \n I must note, however, that the synopses for the stories were more interesting than most of the stories themselves. Sex is the focus of the stories; some of it was more disgusting than enjoyable. \n The stories are not related and can be read in any order. In the first part or story, titled \"Under the Shadow of Wings\", I did not enjoy the narration one bit. It felt like bits and pieces were scattered and there was no fixed timeline. Also, there was a mention of mighty sword at the beginning but it was never referred to again, which was strange. There was also a transfer of power but there was no rising tension to meet this power surge. \n In addition, contradictory tones in some parts, including \"She had already won. She had just come back to collect.\" It's like winning and collecting - we don't know what exactly, probably souls, except that they belong to her and \"all her dead relatives\" - are being justified. \n The story quickly shifts to impossible sex in an airplane restroom, which is tiny for one person, let alone two with one of them having wings! I also found the ideas she thinks are from her dead relatives rather confusing. \n \"Under the Shadow of Wings\" was an overall weird story and I really disliked it. It was the opening story and seriously put me off the rest of the book for a bit. \n The second story titled \"Eyes Only\" is considerably long compared to the first and last ones and makes up the bulk of the book. It is also the most enjoyable of the three. \n It is a story within a story within a story with a spectacular twist at the end, making it far more complex than the other two. \n With also a lot of sex, \"Eyes Only\" is bursting with suspense. It boasts several bits of imagery, including: \"Like a junkie, my addiction to her had galloped out of control.\" \n \"Eyes Only\" was not free of confusion, however. Still it is mostly enjoyable and interesting. \n The third and final story in Anger's Children is \"The Dark Man\". \n \"You remain a poignant gossamer of idealistic dreams instead of a champion of organised power - an actual force to be reckoned with.\" - these words echo at the end of the story as well, resulting in an unexpected and intriguing ending. \n As a reader, I wanted to know who the characters were. Are they gods? Or are they pawn in a game for the gods? \n Even though the characters have names, we don't know anything about them, except that they have met - and had sex - several times before and that they have been around for centuries. \n I also felt the storyline and timeline were quite vague. \n Overall rating: Again hard to judge but 2-2.5 stars. \n Note: I received a free copy via Xpresso Book Tours in exchange for an honest review."}

{"text": "2.5/5 \n I really enjoyed 97% of this book. There were a few things that could have been improved, but overall I was really invested in this story. This definitely was a 3.5 rounded up 4 four at least if not an outright 4. And then an incident occurred which was really troubling. Because of this event and how the author handled it, I can't rate this any higher. \n Let's move on to the positives! \n The friendship and humor between Falcio, Brasti and Kest is wonderful. Absolutely enjoyed their banter and gentle teasing. \n I also thought that the world was really interesting. \n The idea of the Greatcoats, wondering Magisters whose job is to mete out justice according to the King's law, was really creative, especially since they have been disbanded. Additionally, I found it interesting that Falcio was a principled man, and yet very violent and willing to kill if the situation called for it. \n I also really loved how de Castell described the fighting scenes. They were very detailed and Falcio would take time to describe why he was or wasn't using a certain move or fighting technique. It didn't slow down the pace of the fighting, just made it seem more realistic. \n I also very much enjoyed the flashbacks to King Paelis and loved the philosophical discussions between him and Falcio. Paelis is such and optimistic and principled character that it makes what happened that much more heartbreaking. \n Let's move on to what could have been improved! \n There's magic in this book, but it's never explained. This is a personal pet peeve of mine, and it really angers me when author's can't be bothered with creating a magical system. \n I was initially confused in the beginning of the book because it was difficult for me to tell one character from another. I wish de Castell had done a better job of initially differentiating his characters. \n The word whore gets used. A lot. Almost always by men. I'm honestly confused by what the author's intent is here. I wished this world's attitude towards women was explained a little more clearly. \n I don't want to spoil anything, so I will just say that I thought the ending was a bit deus ex machina. I think a bit more setup would have helped the believe ability of this solution. \n Moving on to the event that really pissed me off. Spoilers! \n Falcio gets raped. If I were being super generous, I would call it very dubious consent. He is lying on his back in bed and verbally tells the woman no several times. She then proceeds to chain his hands to the headboard while he is still protesting. He even thinks, \"She looked at me as if she was waiting for an answer, but I couldn't speak. I felt nothing but shame at that moment, and no words would come out.\" Then she proceeds to straddle and grind him, again without any verbal consent. \"...she began moving her hips again, slowly, gently. I made no movements in return, and we stayed like that for such a long time, I believe I fell asleep for minutes at a time. But somehow I found myself inside her...\" \n I'm not opposed to rape appearing in books and this would be fine, except we're supposed to view this as a good thing. It's supped to be a cleansing healing experience. The next day Falcio even thinks, \"That morning was as unlike the days that had preceded it as anything you can imagine. I awoke again and the pain was gone from my wounds. Even more striking, the pain was gone from inside me.\" \n Nope. Sorry. This is not ok. All we needed was a simple yes, or even a thought yes (since this is first person narration). What editor read this was like, \"Yup, totally fine! Non-consensual sex is a balm for the soul!\" \n I am going to continue on with this series because I thought there was a ton of great stuff in this book, but I'm going to have to pretend the offending incident didn't occur."}

Last year, I wasn't even sure I wanted to start this new series (both the cover as the synopsis didn't really do it for me), yet I was convinced by the writer (love the Throne of Glass-series) and the connection to Beauty and the Beast. Now, this might be one of my favorite current ongoing series. No, it's not a quality piece of literature and it doesn't contain beautiful enchanting writing style, but the story is so addicting. I flew through this. So. Freaking. Addicting. Also, where the first book was connected to Beauty and the Beast, this book is connected to another fairy tale/myth; namely that of Hades and Persephone. Read my review on A Court of Thorns and Roses here . \n '\"I smelled jasmine first--then saw stars. A sea of stars flickering beyond glowing pillars of moonstone that framed the sweeping view of endless snowcapped mountains. \"Welcome to the Night Court,\" was all Rhys said.' \n Feyre ended up having her happy ever after, surviving Amarantha Under the Mountain and joining her beast Tamlin in the Spring Court. Yet, it doesn't really feel like a happy ever after; actually, it doesn't even come close. Feyre still suffers from nightmares and trauma after her experiences Under the Mountain and she doesn't seem able to share them with her love. They don't share anything except their bed. Even though her promise to Rhysand, to stay with him a week every month, seemed like a horrible thing at the time, it comes as a relief now. Trouble in paradise...? \n '\"I will say this once--and only once,\" Rhysand purred, stalking to the map on the wall. \"You can be a pawn, be someone's reward, and spend the rest of your immortal life bowing and scraping and pretending you're less than him, than Ianthe, than any of us. If you want to pick that road, then fine. A shame, but it's your choice.\" The shadow of wings rippled again. \"But I know you--more than you realize, I think--and I don't believe for one damn minute that you're remotely fine with being a pretty trophy for someone who sat on his ass for nearly fifty years, then sat on his ass while you were shredded apart.\"' \n While reading A Court of Thorns and Roses I loved Tamlin, but I also loved Rhys, and I knew something was happening there. Yet I dreaded a love triangle; it happened in Throne of Glass, and I'm kind of done with them. Thank god; no love triangle. Feyre makes her choice quite clearly in A Court of Mist and Fury and it is a great and logic choice. So good actually, I doubted all the feelings and thoughts I had while reading A Court of Thorns and Roses. At the time they seemed perfectly fitting, yet now I'm rethinking everything that happened and I'm even kind of resenting certain relationships and persons from that first part now. Which I think is quite awesome; well done Sarah J. Maas. \n \"'No one was my master--but I might be master of everything, if I wished. If I dared.\"' \n Again, the relationships and characters in this book were to die for. I loved the romantic parts and all the new characters were very exciting; Morrigan, Amren, Azrien and Cassian all found their way in to my heart. What I liked most about this book was the fact that after finishing A Court of Thorns and Roses I felt like the book had a closed ending; I had no clue what would happen in next parts. The story unfolding itself in A Court of Mist and Fury was a complete surprise for me, and so very intriguing. \n \"He thinks he'll be remembered as the villain in the story.\" She snorted. \"But I forgot to tell him,\" I said quietly, opening the door, \"that the villain is usually the person who locks up the maiden and throws away the key.\" \"Oh?\" I shrugged. \"He was the one who let me out.\" \n This book was amazing. Again, not a piece of fantastic literature, but who needs that all the time? This series is surprising, lovable and absolutely addicting. My 5-star rating is purely based on the excitement this book gives me while reading, but also while craving the next part. Even the very explicit sexual scenes (no idea why this book is rated young-adult) gave me the chills. So hot. LOVED THIS."}

{"text": "Humans and elves are at war and have a mutual species hatred for each other. The humans think the elves (there's no confirmation, however, that the elves did this) released the ferals-roided up wild animals-onto human lands. The ferals have one purpose: to kill all humans (Bender would be proud). The story begins with Ayden, an elf ranger, cheering on the ferals from a distance while they harass some humans. However, Ayden's sister, Ella, goes to see a human friend, Ayden follows, and they both get captured. Upon capture, they're brought to the prince, Freyrik, and he takes more than a little bit of a liking to Ayden, who becomes his slave. \n In many ways, this book is very simple: it's a BDSM romance between a king and his reluctant slave. In other ways, I found myself surprised with how much care is taken to build that relationship into something that wasn't creepy. There's a lot of back and forth between Ayden, and the slowing down of the main plot (the imminent attack of the feral surge) gives Ayden and Freyriks' relationship time to grow into something more mutual and less coercive. Yes, there is a lot of erotica here, maybe more than some readers want, but there's enough other plot that the story shows as much restraint as Freyrik in focusing on the more sexual aspects of the relationship. (That said, it's an M/M adult romance; expect dicks.) \n Read the rest at Throw This Book at Me"}
{"text": "Curtsies & Conspiracies is the second book in the Finishing School series. It is a YA steampunk novel that has elements of romance, mystery, adventure, and humor. It stands at 310 pages and was published November 2013 by Hachette Little, Brown & Co. \n ANALYSIS: I have been following Gail Carriger's writing since her Parasol Protectorate series. Last year, when I came across her newest series Finishing School, I was delighted to see a 'spin off' of sorts. \n The first novel in the Finishing School series had many of the same elements that Parasol Protectorate had. It had the bold, sarcastic main female character, the 'airy/spacy' sidekick, lots of humor, and the steampunk/vampire/werewolf mix. The only true difference was the target age group. Where Parasol Protectorate was more for a 'mature' audience, Finishing School was for a younger YA crowd. \n Now, Gail Carriger has delighted readers with the second installment in the Finishing School series. While I enjoyed reading it and found it humorous, I struggled with pacing of the novel and the seemingly lack of a main plot. \n I am sure that Curtsies & Conspiracies had a main plot. In fact, I remember bits and pieces of it, but sadly it was overshadowed by an overwhelming number of minor secondary plots and tid-bits. \n For example, there was a love triangle between Sophronia, Soap, and Lord Mercer, there was a ball to debut one of the other sub-characters, and there was a 'test' of sorts where everyone ignored Sophronia. What I do not recall is the main 'mystery' adventure plot and even upon reading the description of the book, I still do not recall it. Obviously, it wasn't able to shine. \n Curtsies & Conspiracies does have all the same humor and wit that Gail Carriger brought to previous books, including the first of the series. However, this is certainly not her strongest nor her best novel. It dragged, it seemed skittish in plot flow, and really just seemed a bit out there with no real point to why it was written or a part of the series. \n Gail Carriger did something similar with her first adult steampunk series too. The middle books didn't really seem to propel or move the plot of the series along and just seemed thrown out there like a silly after thought. They were fun to read - in the moment - but they didn't stick. \n Overall, Curtsies & Conspiracies is a fast paced read that is delightful for the moment, but it didn't really leave a lasting impression on me due to the overwhelming secondary plots and lack of a main plot. Fans of Gail Carriger will certainly love this book, but it really does not represent her best work."}
{"text": "An excellent read. Riley is an apprentice demon trapper and she's damn cool - a well rounded and likeable lead character. She's kick ass, sweet, funny and not in anyway bolshy. She's vulnerable too, which a key event early on in the book shows. I liked the story line and can see a number of areas where the series could go to. \n I wasn't so keen on some of the linguistics - the Scottish master and Riley's father's 'partner' Beck's conversation was written in their accents (I know there's a techincal word for this - I learnt it in A-Level English Language but I've forgotten) which is something I really detest in books. The only person I think to have gotten away with it with me is Irvine Welsh because his books are a work of art. The use of 'ya' for you and 'ta' for to just annoy me - it suggests people are too stupid to remember that these characters have regional accents. However, it is easy enough to gloss over this. \n I'm keeping my fingers crossed that there isn't going to be another love triangle/rectangle/octagon a la every single young adult paranormal book on the market these days because I really like the innocent relationship that Riley seems to have with Simon but I doubt I'm going to get my wish with all these mystery men showing up in her life. Unusually for me I'm not on the side of the bad boy in this - I'm not sure I really like Beck's character - sure, he really does care for Riley but there's something a little bit off about him for me that doesn't make him as likeable as I susoect he is meant to be. \n I liked the details in the book - for example, the little Magpie demon who stole Riley's 'N' key from her laptop and then returned it - so sweet. \n Looking forward to seeing where this goes."}

{"text": "*I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest and fair review. \n I have to admit, it took me a while to really get into this book. Not that it wasn't interesting, I was just so confused. Miralem! Fanarlem! Daramons! The first half of the book kind of see-sawed between not enough information and too much. By the second half of the book, it really took off. \n I found myself much less annoyed with the Hidden Lands' constant history lessons and lengthy descriptions when I realized this was going to be a series. The author did a fantastic job with world building and including even the smallest details, making it seem all the more believable and real. (I want to try a can of B-Bite.) \n I really enjoyed that the romance remained on the back burner throughout, enough so that I was always wondering whether they were going to get together at all. (At least in the first book. It seemed obvious that at some point they would get together.) Olivia was an awesome heroine, one of my favorites in a while. She was strong, kind, and completely non-whiny. I hate whiny, self-pitying heroines. And Alfred, adorable Alfred. I really liked him. There were a few moments when I found his complacency annoying, but by the end of the book, that aspect of him was gone. I love watching characters grow, and grow he did. \n Now, for the best part, the drawings! I loved them so much. I wish more books had illustrations. \n I have to admit, I was not a fan of the couple of little chapters interspersed throughout the book on how the book came about. I love reading about the author's process and getting inside an author's head, just not in the middle of the book. It kind of jerked me out of the story. In my opinion, that kind of thing is best left for an intro or at the end. \n All in all, a really fun read, one I truly enjoyed."}

{"text": "Fantastic, as always. I loved the heavy Ronan focus, as Ronan is one of my favorite characters of all time, and this book only solidified that stance. Fantastic character development across the board. This book gives us more insight into all of our favorite raven boys, and Blue. Some reviewers said they felt like there wasn't enough Blue in this story, but I couldn't disagree more. If anything, in this novel I really felt like it was easy to see the way Blue really affects (and improves) the group dynamic. Blue's exchanges with Noah are particularly worth paying attention to if you are Blue fan (who isn't? Great female lead). \n The only reason I'm giving four stars instead of five is because I felt like there wasn't enough development of the Glendower plot arc, and because, like many middle books in series, it seemed a tad 'mushy' in places. It doesn't have a proper beginning or conclusion on its own. You will be left with more questions than answers, and that's just how middle books are. \n I can't wait till the next book comes out. This series is absolutely 'can't miss' if you love urban fantasy, books set in Virginia (we just do not get enough...), or books about characters that have serious murky depths."}

It wasn't just a rinse and repeat with the whole there's a spell and we have to find all the items adventure.

The lusty, slightly evil and very mischievous Fae Prince has been merrily wreaking havoc through many of the Highlander books, and having him take centre stage is a bit of a risk. In earlier stories, however, Moning did manage to drop hints that there was more to Adam than anyone would think. This story proved it. I had a great time reading the whole book, loved revisiting the MacKeltar couples as well. The ending was absolutely perfect! Absolutely! Perfect! :)"}

{"text": "Jacob had what could understatedly be called an unusual upbringing by an occultist family in North Dakota. But these aren't just any crazies living off the grid-Jake is from the Greene family, a group of fanatics who believe they're going to be the ones to bring about the Apocalypse by releasing the Younger Gods of the Deep into the human world and ushering in the last age of man. This-and a graphic incident where Jake's only childhood friend is tricked into getting his heart cut out on prom night-causes Jake to flee from his family and move to New York City. Jake hopes to leave all of his occult baggage behind him, but when his sister, Esther, begins committing ritualistic sacrifices in Central Park, he knows he's the only one who can stop her. \n Jake enlists the help of his Nephilim roommate (Carter), the daughter of a voodoo high priestess (Antoinette), an ex-NYPD cop turned supernatural soldier (Dorthea), and a smorgasbord of other denizens of New York that are involved in the supernatural community. During the best moments, the complex supernatural network is reminiscent of what I loved about Neil Gaimen's Neverwhere; we're treated to what feels like the tip of the iceberg of a vast and complex world. The aspects of supernatural New York are deftly woven with the aspects of what makes real New York unique, and this story definitely feels like it couldn't have taken place anywhere else but New York. That said, you'll enjoy this story more if you like New York or buy into the mystique (and what I personally consider the myth) of what makes New York special. If you're a bit 'meh' on New York in general, then the little details of this book might just make you role your eyes. The major plot of the book is Jake & Co. going around to each burrough to alert and then help protect the five hearts of New York. If you just rolled your eyes at that line, you probably shouldn't read this book because this plot consumes the majority of the story. \n Read the rest of the review at Throw This Book at Me"}

{"text": "The Witches of BlackBrook by Tish Thawer is the first instalment in the Witches of BlackBrook series; however, it is does not have an open-ending. \n Quick-paced and easy to navigate, the story is about three witches: Karina, Kara and Kenna, who lived in the late 1600's, when magic was practiced freely. Mischief befalls the three, when a woman tricks the elder sister, claiming her baby is ill. After that, Karina is accused of killing the baby and being the devil's daughter. She is sentenced to burn at the stake, where she performs a spell to protect her and her sisters. \n Karina's spell takes the sisters, and the rest of the witches, across time, to be reborn in different bodies every time. \n The Witches of BlackBrook opens with a short but powerful prologue. We see a witch's sacrifice from the first page, which immediately gives an idea about the character, even though we are not sure who that character is from the beginning but later learn that it is Karina. \n The novel shifts between the present, where Karina is Trin, and their episodes and events from their past life before and during Karina's trial. Trin is a massage therapist and lives with her roommate/sister Kit, believed to be Kenna. Throughout their previous lives, they have been in constant search of their third sister Kara, but to no avail. \n The narration is in the third person throughout the novel, but we get the sense of things coming from certain perspectives. There are also short sections of an unknown character constantly trying to separate the three sisters and prevent their union. This character adds suspense and gives a strong eerie and creepy atmosphere. \n In the present, Trin meets Caris, a teacher, who recently moved back to BlackBrook with her cousin. During her first massage session with Caris, Trin sees memories of her and her sisters and immediately believes that Caris might be the third lost sister. However, Kit believes otherwise and we get a strong sense of jealousy. \n I enjoyed the use of spells, and the seamless shift between present and past. \n Trin may be the eldest sister, but she's not the wisest. And I really liked that. \"Trin was always thrown off when another witch was around. She desperately wanted everyone they'd stumbled upon to be Kara, that she'd lost perspective over the years.\" \n There is also the character of Jason, Caris' cousin, who is instantly attracted to Trin and reminds her of her long lost love, Jeramiah. \n The overall setting and descriptions throughout the novel are vivid, but there were several images and lines that stood out for me: \n \"She should be excited and proud of Kit, and she was, but the urgency of finding out what magical barrier was being cast upon her entire destiny seemed like a trump card in her book.\" \n There was also the use of tarot readings. \"Trin acknowledged the Magician card as her past, no surprises there. But the present and future card had her undivided attention. \n The Seven of Swords indicated deceit and deception surrounding her present, while the reversed Tower forewarned her of major changes, where she could no longer count on those close to her.\" \n Although in several instances the novel reminded me of the book and television series Charmed, Tish Thawer put in several twists, giving The Witches of BlackBrook its own character. \n Overall: A quick-paced magical five-star must read."}

{"text": "I was sent a review copy of this book by Harper Voyager publishing. \n Having loved everything about The Child Thief and his gothic, visceral perception on Peter Pan, I was beyond excited to explore Brom's take on the Christmas mythos. Something about Brom's writing makes the most outlandish, fantastical things seem perfectly plausible in his worlds, even Santa, Odin's wolves, and ravens against Krampus and his once human Belsnickles, duking it out with broadswords and pistols in the middle of rural Virginia. Brom captures the complexities and humanity of his characters so well, readers really feel for them, hate them, and might even be reminded of someone. It's enthralling how raw and real their motivations, back stories, personalities, and emotions are. Brom helps to really make readers empathize and relate to Jesse, the failed musician and father, that resorts to drastic measures to try make right by his family when Santa's sack literally falls through his roof. Anyone reading would definitely DESPISE The General, his cronies, and Dillard, for how much they have it out for Jesse. And I'll admit, by the end of it, I even felt for Krampus and his utter loathing for Santa Claus and his struggle against the blending of Yule and Christmas. Brom's prose is as delightful as his amazing art work, always included. The illustrations are never required to visualize his characters, but it certainly helps to solidify what pictures he paints in reader's minds. Spot on what I imagined, for sure. Educational, to an extent, fascinating, and a joy to curl up and read with a hot chocolate and candy canes. Krampus: The Yule Lord is a great read for any time of year, but especially around Christma... I mean, Yuletide. :)"}

{"text": "This trilogy is officially one of my favorites! It's just so incredibly addictive! \n Penryn is a smart, badass protagonist who doesn't let romance drive her actions and I love her so much for that. Raffe is great. The twins are hilarious! And I greatly appreciate the emphasis on Penny's family as important players in the story in this book, and I really grew to like them. \n That being said, I feel a bit conflicted about the ending. I understand why what happened might have been the best viable option; however, it still felt rushed and convoluted. There are so many questions left unanswered that I just wish there would have been another book or two in order to reach a cleaner, more fleshed out resolution. \n For example, what was up with Penryn's mom? While I loved that she grew to be an important player in the war, I really thought that there would be something more to her story. Why was she so intent on collecting rotten eggs? The whole rotten egg situation just seemed far too coincidental for my taste. One of my theories originally was that she was perhaps one of the angel's Daughter of Man and through that she somehow knew about the Pit; and whether she had escaped or they'd let her go, maybe the trauma from the experience was one of the things that led to the deterioration of her mental health. I just felt like there was so much potential to her story, especially because she always seemed so in touch with the \"otherworldly\" things that were happening around them. \n Uriel's death also seemed really anticlimactic. Heck, most of the final fight scene did! And while I am happy that Raffe (and the rest of the Watchers, too since I grew to like them) decided to stay on earth, again, it just seemed far too convenient! And where were they able to even get Beliel's wings in order to attach them to Raffe? What happened to all the creatures and experiments? Paige can now so conveniently eat non-human meat now? I need explanations and answers!!! \n I still really enjoyed the trilogy, and it has become a favorite, but I still wish there would have been a bit more to the story. I would have maybe rated it a bit lower, but I had so much fun reading this and I became so attached to Penryn and Raffe that I'm willing to give this a solid 4 stars instead of maybe a 3.5. \n I still highly recommend this trilogy if you've been in a slump like I have, or if you just want to pick up an fun, addictive book to fly through!"}

They're glamoured. \n While she's trying to figure out who those teens were and why the blonde haired boy with an attitude is calling her a mundane, the apartment she lives in with her mother gets broken into and her mother is taken. When she arrives, the place is in ruins and her mother is gone, but the apartment isn't empty. Something is still lurking and attacks her. The blonde boy comes in and saves her and takes her back to the Institute - a sort of home base for what the boy and his friends are."}

I feel like there were a lot of things that didn't sound like JKR, and therefore don't fit with canon. The fact that Voldemort and Bellatrix had a daughter just doesn't sit well with me. I feel like the playwrights took some liberties with the story and what I really want is just the story Jo wrote, not the play it was based off of. I'm a bit disappointed honestly."}
{"text": "Pratchett continues his descent into writing pure drivel. It's sad. \n The story itself is horribly predictable and stale, and the writing is just cringeworthy. Someone, somewhere, has a checklist of all inventions humanity has ever made, and that person is slowly going through and writing a dull, embarrassing mess for each one of them. I don't know who that person is, but it's not the Terry Pratchett that I grew up with."}

{"text": "I have not read a great epic fantasy in such a long time, this was honestly very refreshing. Thank you for a copy of this story for a review, Dean! \n The tone of this novel was exceptionally well written. It's a poetic, dark, and adventurous tale told in the eyes of a man named Ifferon who is the last of his bloodline of the God, Telm. Telm had banished a beast name Agon to the underworld and on Telm's death-bed, he requested that Ifferon carries the duty to ensure the imprisonment of Agon. But this task and its journey which leads to the outer world will be far from simple. \n Here we see a tremendous transformation of Ifferon, brilliant character development. In the beginning, he was weak, but through his endeavors, he meets great friends, enemies, and becomes the stuff made of heroes. \n Like all epic adventures, there are many places, many characters of different races and abilities. We are by far not left short on a true mythical expedition. \n Wilson obtains an outstanding talent to keep the reader captivated by painting with the power of words a world entirely unique, dark, dangerous and all so exciting. There were moments I felt as if I were there in on his journey, had to blink a few times and think to myself, \"Wow, where did time go?\" \n I hear this is just the first book in a series? I cannot wait to see what happens next on this exhilarating adventure! \n (Did I mention this was his debut novel? Seriously, it's written as if by a man of decades of experience. Pure genius, and that my friends, is not exaggerated. This guy knows what he loves!)"}

{"text": "A volte solo la morte puo ridare la vita... e salvare un amore che sembrava impossibile. \n Prima di leggere Lost Grace mi sono concessa il piacere di rileggere il primo capitolo di questa saga, ovvero Dark Divine. \n Un po perche oramai era trascorso un anno intero dalla mia ultima lettura e anche perche adoro dare un senso di continuita a cio che ho amato leggere! \n Le 4 stelle che diedi al primo vi possono lasciar intendere quanto abbia atteso questo secondo capitolo della trilogia di Bree Despain... ma a quanto pare la maledizione del lupo o del sequel non hanno risparmiato questa saga! \n Ritroviamo Grace e Daniel 10 mesi dopo ill fatidico giorno nel quale lei salvo il suo fidanzato dalla maledizione del lupo, poco prima di essere morsa e infettata a sua volta dal fratello Jude. \n Nell'estate che sta volgendo al termine Grace viene addestrata da Daniel per riuscire a sviluppare e controllare i suoi nuovi poteri, cercando di perfezionare una sorta di equilibrio interiore che le permettera di tenere a bada il lupo che reclama di prendere il sopravvento della sua mente! \n L'anima di Daniel e salva e per Grace non c'e nulla di piu importante ma adesso e la sua a essere tentata! \n Jude abbandona la sua famiglia a causa del grande senso di colpa nei confronti della sorella e questo avvenimento distrugge la serenita della famiglia Divine. La madre di Grace alterna fasi da maniaca del controllo ad uno stato quasi catatonico nel quale ascolta di continuo i notiziari in cerca del volto del figlio scomparso. Il reverendo Divine oramai trascorre la maggior parte del suo tempo fuori casa nella continua ricerca del figlio e Grace riesce a stento a mantenere la sua media scolastica e a seguire gli allenamenti con Daniel, che vorrebbe cercare una cura per lei... e sogna il Trenton college per entrambi. \n Il tutto viene peggiorato da una serie di crimini, atti vandalici e rapine che si susseguono a ritmo sempre piu frequente nella tranquilla cittadina di Rose Crest. \n Da questo momento in poi Grace, poco alla volta, vede vacillare tutte le sue certezze: la sua famiglia sgretolata dal dolore, Daniel diventa sempre piu freddo e distante nei suoi confronti, April la sua migliore amica la evita da quando ha scoperto il suo segreto. Jude il fratello che non vede da mesi, si fa vivo con una telefonata nella quale la avverte di non fidarsi di nessuno e che qualcuno sta arrivando in citta a prenderla! \n Grace e sempre piu sola, sembra che proprio le persone che hanno promesso di amarla e proteggerla adesso abbiano creato un muro intorno a lei fatto di bugie, silenzi e liti. \n Ecco che proprio nel momento di maggiore vulnerabilita di Grace arriva il famigerato \"buon samaritano\" un ragazzo di nome Talbot che con la sua aria da ragazzo di campagna sostiene, incoraggia e copre Grace di tante attenzioni, la fa sentire utile e importante! \n Ma Grace cedera alle sue lusinghe? \n Daniel continua ad amarla nonostante lei adesso sia un'altra Grace? \n Le bugie creano una voragine sempre piu profonda e allontanano Grace dalla verita... ad un passo dal perdere se stessa e le persone che ama per sempre! \n L'azione dell'intero libro risiede proprio negli ultimi capitoli che svelano parte dei segreti e fanno chiarezza sui dubbi che ancora non avevano avuto una risposta... ma adesso altre incognite attendono l'ultimo capitolo di questa saga! \n Solo un sacrificio fatto per amore puo modificare il corso degli eventi! \n I personaggi \n Grace cambia radialmente il suo carattere sia per via del lupo che porta in se, che la tenta con pensieri volenti e la sprona a metterli in atto contro la sua volonta. Ma anche perche Daniel e i suoi genitori cambiano drasticamente il loro atteggiamento lasciandola sola con la maledizione che porta in se! \n Daniel che avevo amato per il fascino del suo carattere misterioso e per i suoi trascorsi da bad boy, adesso mi fa provare solo una tremenda antipatia per lui... e assurdo il modo nel quale intende proteggere Grace ricoprendo la di bugie e mezze verita! \n I genitori di Grace poco coerenti, impongono coprifuochi assurdi alla figlia e poi la madre vegeta davanti alla tv e il padre scompare per settimane?????? \n Su Talbot manterro un po di riserbo... a parte che detesto le camicie di flanella a scacchi, aldila di cio credo che per lui ci saranno dei risvolti interessati nel terzo capitolo! \n Mi risulta alquanto impossibile non fare dei parallelismi con il primo libro, in Dark Divine il mistero e il fascino dell'amore impossibile hanno catalizzato immediatamente la mia attenzione gia dai primissimi capitoli... ma in questo sequel sembra che la trama gia da subito segua un percorso prestabilito e inevitabile. Ho la certezza di sapere dove la Despain voglia andare a parare quando, capitolo dopo capitolo, i protagonisti hanno un cambio repentino di personalita. \n Grace vede andare in pezzi la sua famiglia \"perfetta\", il suo amore per Daniel si veste di bugie e segreti e ogni giorno che passa e sempre piu sola... esatto, sembra fatto apposta, quando lei ha bisogno di sostegno e chiarezza, tutti diventano di colpo misteriosi ed enigmatici... le persone che ama si allontanano di colpo.. \n Insomma non le resta che perdersi e sbagliare... inevitabilmente! \n Ed eccolo li a far capolino il tanto atteso terzo incomodo o triangolo o buon samaritano, qualsiasi appellativo vogliate dare alla new entry di fatto e questo il suo obbiettivo: creare un presunto diversivo alla trama, che aimhe stava cadendo nell'ovvio piu totale! \n Al nostro Talbot ragazzotto aitante di campagna viene affidata la veste di cavalier servente e per la nostra Gracie diventa la via d'uscita e il sostegno in questo periodo difficile della sua vita! \n Sorvolero sul fatto che in Lost Grace l'azione non faccia tanto capolino nella trama, se non fosse per qualche (tafferuglio) vero o presunto tale... il ritmo dell'intero libro sembra un tantino lento... solo negli ultimi tre capitoli ho la sensazione che alla trama sia stata iniettata una dose di adrenalina che ha reso il ritmo piu veloce e interessate! \n Ho apprezzato lo stile narrativo del primo libro,c osa che non posso affermare anche di questo sequel. \n Il mio punto di vista e che il secondo capitolo di una trilogia deve consacrare il successo di una saga, deve sviluppare la trama e catturare il lettore con novita e nuove incognite... non dare qualche briciola di emozioni per poi scemare nello scontato con il solito triangolino! \n Dopo aver terminato questo libro ho solo una flebile curiosita per l'ultimo capitolo ,spero proprio che l'autrice riesca a dare un bel finale a questa storia che mi era rimasta nella mente per diversi giorni! \n Pretendevo di piu da questo sequel... o forse sto diventando meno intransigente in fatto di trame, dalle quali pretendo originalita a tutti i costi ;) \n VOTO: 3 stelle Goodreads"}

{"text": "I'm just amazed! I'm not the type to love books like these: Gadarene had lots of dark themes but that adds to its appeal. Reading fanfiction is becoming a hobby of mine and I'm pleasantly surprised that most people who write fanfiction are usually better than the authors who are published. Nobody gives them the credit they deserve. \n Gadarene is an M-M romance with King Arthur and Merlin as the main characters. Arthur is powerless, unable to change anything about anything and is basically frustrated with his helplessness. The main reason is that Arthur is known to unexpectedly slip into bouts of madness which gives him his nickname: The Mad Prince. Because of this 'condition', Camelot is currently under the regency of Agravaine, Arthur's uncle. \n Enter Merlin. Merlin, while protecting Ealdor, his village, get captured by Agravaine's lackeys and is forced into slavery. Along the way to Camelot, he is forced to endure the violation of his body. As if that wasn't enough, the raiders had his magic, which is illegal in Camelot, bound by iron manacles. \n When they meet, Arthur finds an immediate need to protect Merlin and to do that, he buys Merlin as a sex slave. And thus Merlin and Arthur grow together and learn to rely on eachother. As the dragon said, they're two sides of the same coin. \n This is a chillingly, beautiful story which I fell in love with. The characters were in depth, the storyline was original and real and the growth between Merlin and Arthur were endearingly sweet and cripplingly dark at the same time. 5 stars well deserved."}
{"text": "I couldn't finish this book. I may try it again in the future because its not a long book, but I just couldn't connect with the characters.

{"text": "4.5 Stars for this paranormal M/M shifter romance. It's the second book in a series and should probably be read in order. \n Dylan and Avery have been together for a few months. Avery has moved into Dylan's home and they are building a life together, but it's not easy. Avery is working long hours in his training as a private investigator. He comes home late and doesn't see Dylan a lot. Dylan's very protective, and often shadows Avery when he's out on a case--it's caused friction in the past, but I think Avery is appreciating it more now. It's almost a comfort. Well, it can be. \n Avery's still working on a side case, finding a trafficked shifter girl from Dylan's pack, Lacey. It's hard work as the main players in the case keep turning up dead. Plus, there's issue with Avery's family not liking Dylan--out of prejudice. Avery's \"invited\" home for his brother's wedding, and it's not a pretty scene, but I loved their growing bond, and the real maturity Avery displayed in such a rough environment. \n This book is not about the romance. There are a few sexytimes, which are nice and sexy, but that's not the focus. Dylan and Avery have to build their relationship, which struggles due to conflicting schedules. Avery's obsession with finding Lacey definitely puts him in trouble with his mate, and Dylan's as understanding a wolf as one will find. There were times both Dylan and I wanted to shake Avery, not because he was deliberately mean or obtuse, but because he sacrificed so much of himself and the fruit of his labor was...nothing. The end of the book wraps so quickly, with a break in the case that leads to a seriously dramatic rescue. I felt like that was really well done, with all the proper foreshadowing in place. I loved how the resolution left us in little doubt that Avery and Dylan were going to make it in the long-term. There are some other sub-plots out there that concern secondary characters from this book finding their mates, so I expect to read more about those as the series progresses."}
{"text": "This book is what happens when the Harry Potter kids grow up, join the cast of Girls, and whine about it for 300 plus pages. These self-indulgent hipsters somehow manage to take the magic out of Magic by drowning it in a deluge of tepid red wine and poor life choices. The supposed emotional complexity of these kids reads a lot like overly precious, after school special on the dangers of being rich and bored. This book is chock full of smarmy, pseudo-intellect angst. If you've already started and wonder if it suddenly picks up...spoiler alert it doesn't."}

And other items. \n I cannot wait to continue this series. Really one of my favorite fantasy series :)"}
{"text": "Damien is finally in love -- he's a wicked, lethal character in the previous books so getting to know more about him was something to look forward to..

Compared to Elena, Honor seems like a novice when it comes to being a hunter.. It's normal to draw comparisons with Elena in couple of scenes because Elena is damn great at her job & frankly, Honor seems to try too hard & plainly sucks! She is a victim of a disgusting gang rape that keeps on popping up in every chapter, that apparently scarred her but she also seems to completely be at ease when it comes to having sex with Damien! Obviously, there isn't anything wrong with that though the transition psychologically has too many loopholes.. & really, her character was written too hurriedly or something & whatever didn't make sense was included in her -- also, kudos to the car sex scene between Damien & Honor (LOL, had to include that).. & please please, write a book on ashwini & janvier!

He's looking for a miracle, but what he gets instead isn't exactly what he has in mind. He goes digging one night after stealing a porcelain cat from his job (you'll see how they're connected in a second) and digs a very big hole. Endless really. What comes out of it, is no angel. In fact, it's Satan - or one of six hundred and sixty-six Satans - this one goes by the name of Burg and as Satan goes, he's pretty laid back. \n All he wants is to stay on earth for a little while, to do that, he asks Max to find him a house - preferably with a hot tub - and if he does this he'll heal his mom. Max is pretty sure that he's going insane, but the other option is letting Burg kill his mom. Enlisting the help of a classmate - Lore - he sets out to find Burg a house. But can he really trust a devil?"}

{"text": "Read my complete review on The Bookshelf Intruder \n I have a confession to make. I don't like sci-fi. I don't hate it but I don't like it either. Out of all the book and film genres, science fiction is my least favorite. That is slowly changing though. \n I surprised myself by signing up for \n Sci-Fi November \n . I remember thinking, this should be fun! After all, I've read a few sci-fi books here and there that I really liked, so I thought, why not? I'm glad I did that because now, I've read more sci-fi books and watched more sci-fi movies. Which was fun, but also mind-boggling. \n One of the sci-fi books I've read recently is \n Reader \n by Erec Stebbins, which is the first book in the \n Daughter of Time \n trilogy. I was actually asked to review the second book, \n Writer \n , which came out last April 26. But of course, I had to read book 1 first so I did exactly that. \n Ambra Dawn is unlike any seventeen year-old girl. She is special, not because she's beautiful or smart or talented but because of cosmic reasons. She is a 'reader', someone who can see what others cannot. You can think of it as 'third eye' or 'sixth sense' but it's not really like that because she can see through time and space. Her power is a blessing and a curse, for it is because of this gift that she was sold as a slave, deformed as a lab rat, and transported to other worlds serve alien creatures. Her power is the reason she lost everything... but it's also the one thing that can save her and the universe from the super villainous Dram. \n Ambra Dawn is a great narrator, a compelling one. I could feel her pain, her sorrow, through her words. Yes, she is powerful but she has lost everything and everyone that is important to her. So I couldn't help but feel for her and be awed at her strength, grace, and resilience. She's probably the most resilient character I've ever come across. \n While Reader is highly character-driven, its world-building (or universe building?) is just as well done. This book is very imaginative and unique in this sense. It really made me think about the possibility of other worlds. Truth is, this book is so well-written that a lot of times, the line between Ambra's world and mine blurred and I kept thinking, is this still fiction? \n Reader is a really engrossing read, with parts that just kept me excited and twists and turns that were mind-blowing. My only criticism is that there were parts that felt overwhelming for me because of the info-dump. But other than that, I can truly say that Reader is one of the best sci-fi novels I've read. I can't wait to read Writer, and more of Erec Stebbins' works."}

{"text": "The Dark Kings continue with Passion Ignites. After seeing some of Thorn in Soul Scorched, I was looking forward to his story and it did not disappoint. Drawn into the story instantly, the storyline flows through each scene with the right amount of pace and action. \n Lexi's an American girl who is having a fun-filled trip, traveling with college roomies...that is until tragedy strikes. Lexi witnesses her friend murder, by a guy with red eyes. Convinced she is going to find the killer, Lexi remains in Edinburgh, while the others return home. Unbeknownst to her, while seeking out the red eyed killer, she has stumbled upon a war to protect humankind. Drawing the attention of the Dark Fae is the last thing Lexi should be doing, yet she falls right in the bull's-eye. \n Thorn, along with Darius, is in Edinburgh to remove the treat of the Dark Fae. Drawn to Lexi, despite not wanting a mate, he feels the need to protect. Despite Lexi's feistiness and instance on stabbing Thorn in each of their meetings, Thorn keeps coming back to protect her...all the while fighting his growing attraction. \n There is a glimpse of Rhi and Balladyn, as well as a mysterious blimp concerning the Reapers. And Ulrik is still a puzzle that remains. Passion Ignites can be read as a standalone; however it is part of an ongoing series. Passion Ignites was provided by Netgalley for an honest review."}

Is fast paced, and fun to read. It was the perfect way to introduce us to the city after Steelheart, and I can't wait to read Firefight!"}

{"text": "Celeste is a psychic who sees too much and what she sees, might just get her in trouble. Four women have died in the local area and Celeste has had visions of their deaths. The local sheriff believes her but John who belongs to a private investigative company who has been called in to help, does not. He wants hard evidence and facts. He refuses to believe her... at least until the evidence starts showing that there may be something to what she is seeing and saying. There is an instant attraction between John and Celeste. Celeste knows that it probably won't go anywhere as John lives a long ways away. John is not about to get involved with a witness. He is still trying to get over the last relationship he had which was with his crooked partner who died by his gun. \n But some things are meant to be overcome. The romance between John and Celeste is hot and heavy and like any new relationship there are misunderstandings. Will they be able to overcome their differences to solve the murders? Will they be able to overcome their mistrust? And will they do it in time? Note: there are some pretty graphic sex scenes. \n Shadow of Danger is a good read. If you are into romance, romantic suspense, thriller, murder, mystery stories, then this is the book for you. You get a bit of all of it here. It's an interesting novel that will keep you guessing as to who is behind the murders and will they discover the person in time."}

Some children/YA authors believe they need to force humor into their books. This forced humor only makes the reader feel talked down to and stupid. Dashner really does a great job using humor that doesn't talk down to readers, but keeps them laughing. \n I cannot speak enough of this book. I LOVED IT!"}

{"text": "I began reading this book about a year ago when I graduated from college. I brought the book with me while I travelled during the summer. I got about half way through the book (I'm a slow reader) when my one year graduate program started and I had to set the book aside. \n About two weeks ago, having basked in the freedom of being done with school [forever] long enough, I picked up the book again and started over. The past year, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I remembered from the book. Even rereading the first half was wonderful; I picked up on so many things that my mind just glazed over the first time through. \n I don't have words strong enough to describe this book, but I truly appreciate it. It's one of those books where you never know what's gonna happen. Everything is so random yet easy to follow. Nothing makes sense and yet you still understand everything completely. You never know what comes next, how things will end, what things could mean - and I think this is something that is difficult to achieve in storytelling, yet Neil does it eloquently. \n As unlikely as everything in this book is, it really gives you the sense that these things could happen, quite possibly are actually happening. \n His writing is so smooth. He gives just enough detail for each character that you really feel like you've met them before. This book is unique. And this book is a real trip. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to step outside the norms of writing and ease into the pleasantness of bewilderment and awe."}

{"text": "First of all, Im in love with these books since I was 12 years old, and I got my first book for Christmas. I was hooked then, and I am still now, several years, books, movies and theme parks later. Once piece of me will always dream about this magical world, and Hogwarts will always be my home. \n Having said that, this is my least favorite book. I enjoyed learning about Voldemort's past, but it took way too much of the book and the school year and it wasn't that much worth it. The other characters, Ron and Hermione, are flat and lack of any flavor; they just leave Harry alone and submerge themselves in a teen world filled of hormones. I really didn't like how they suddenly, form one book to another, are so superficial and blind, and cant care less about Harry and Voldemort. To me it just doesn't make any sense. \n I cried a lot at the end of this book. I know this had to happen, but it still huts when I think about it. But I knew the true from the beginning, I knew it couldn't be as Rowling was showing us and who was actually an allied in disguise. \n If you are expecting a book full of action, this is definitively not it. But this need to happen in order to give room to the final book, the one that changes everything. I just hoped it could have been more fun to read."}

{"text": "Note: I free copy via Xpresso Book Tours in exchange for an honest review. \n Shadow, Shadow by V. B. Marlowe is the first instalment in The Shadow Pines trilogy and an amazing multi-faceted becoming-of-age novel about four school students given four Shadow Boxes on their sixteenth birthday. They, Harley, Teaghan, Gianna and Brock, are told that they have the power to remove one person from their lives by giving them to the shadows, which need to feed. However, they are later told that they must use the Shadow Boxes or someone close to them will be killed/taken by the shadows. \n The novel opens in the middle of an action, giving immediate rise in tension from the first page and marking a strong opening as we see Brock Ethan being arrested. \n \"Everyone was used to me being in trouble, but Brock Ethan? He never did anything wrong.\" \n Shortly after, Brock tells Harley to run and she takes off. We are then transported back to events that happened nine months earlier, when they first received the Shadow Boxes. \n Narrated from the first person perspectives of Harley and Teaghan, Marlowe contrasts the girls' lives and choices. The author also sheds light on the Brock's and Gianna's choices and struggles through these two characters. \n Harley is a rebellious character, often in trouble, grounded and into watching and writing horror movies. Her name reminds me of a Harley Davidson bike, which I often feel she is like in terms of making a statement. However, Harley has several problems and we see from the first chapter that she lacks fatherly affection. \n Her mother disappeared and her father remarried Amy, a cruel and unfair stepmother, from Harley's perspective at least. Harley also has a trouble-making boyfriend, Nash, whom the reader immediately dislikes and deems the perfect candidate to be given to the shadows. \n \"I hadn't heard from Nash all week. That was typical with him. He called when he felt like it, and most of the time when I called him, he didn't answer his phone.\" \n From the first chapters, we see how, despite her misfortunes and familial problems, Harley has more heart than any of the other characters. She has a hard time deciding who she should trade to the shadows, even though several options arise. She even cares for those who have hurt her and takes her time to think of the consequences of \"trading lives\". \n Meanwhile, Teaghan is a geeky, lonely character. She is an introvert and would rather spend her life reading in her room; however, she is often picked on in school. Teaghan is the first to use her Shadow Box, and bit by bit her character changes. \n \"Happiness was a mythical creature that visited other people. I'd never seen it. Sometimes, I felt as if I was the only one who hadn't.\" \n Marlowe does a stellar job in contrasting characters, especially Harley and Teaghan and later Gianna. I think she's done a splendid job with the \"show don't tell\" in her novel. I couldn't help but constantly compare and contrast the characters. \n Another character, a sort of background character is Ava-kaya. She doesn't appear often but she has a major role to play as she is the one who first gives the students the Shadow Boxes. We also never learn how she got all four boxes at the same time. She is also the one with all the info about the shadows and Shadow Boxes, which she reluctantly gives out to Harley bit by bit. \n \"The four of you have been blessed with a great gift. Well, it's a gift for you, but a curse for someone else.\" \n I liked how the Shadow Boxes show the true nature of the characters. Teaghan, for example, begins to appear in a new light to herself and to others. \n Connected by the boxes, each character is tested differently throughout the novel and given different motives and motivations to use their Shadow Boxes. Brock and Gianna's struggles appear towards the end but also shed light on their different characters. \n \"The greatest gift in the world. Trading is what keeps the shadows appeased. It keeps the shadows in their place.\" \n My only problem with the novel is that the prologue or first chapter does not connect with the last, where we see a new character called Michael that we've never encountered before. I don't feel a thirteen-year-old would feel the depth of the characters but that could just be me. (Blurb says for Ages 13 and up). \n Both the narration and language are easy to navigate and light, helping the novel's quick pace, along with short chapters. The imagery, mostly similes, is well placed throughout the novel. Harley is a sarcastic character and her sarcasm adds to the occasional comic relief. \n Overall: 4.75/5 stars - only because the first and last chapters didn't meet for me, but overall, I loved the novel and couldn't put it down. I look forward to the remaining instalments in the trilogy. \n I also liked the cover, which was cute but mysterious at the same time. \n (I would also like to mention that I bookmarked nearly half the novel and wrote tons of notes but to rewrite/copy all that here would spoil the novel and would be too long - just though you should know)."}

{"text": "The Good Wolf was surprisingly unique. Definitely not the standard shifter story. I don't read a huge amount of paranormal stories, so maybe there are more out there, but I haven't read a story that provides such a brutal look at the world of werewolves. \n This story isn't about gorgeous alphas with their band of devoted followers. It isn't about insta-love and werewolf bonding. It shows the horror and violence of the wolf. \n Mason hates every moment of being a werewolf and has spent years trying to find a 'cure'. He is alone, living in isolation, hiding from the man who created him and despising what he has become. \n I didn't feel this was a romance in the traditional sense but Niall and Mason develop a relationship as they deal with the horrific three days each month when the wolf takes over. \n I am now looking forward to reading about the Bad Wolf. \n 3.5 stars \n Visit my blog if you want to see all my m/m reviews in one place!

{"text": "Meyer's strength is creating interesting characters. Sadly, most of them flit in and out of the books without letting us spend much time with them. I love the Cullens as much as anyone else, but I want to know more about Jane. And Marcus. And Caius. And especially, Aro - the seriously twisted, exuberant, downright psychotic \"leader\" of the Volturi. I can't figure out if he's actually nuts, if he's really sincere in everything he says and does, or if he's just playing a part. That is what makes him interesting. Alas, the author must not agree, because rather than show us his story through writing a book about him, she tells it to us in an entry on him in her encyclopedia. Boo. \n That, primarily, is the flaw in Meyer's writing: more telling than showing, and not enough initiative in taking this world she's created and running wild with it. The potential for sequels, prequels, spin-offs, historical fantasy, books about the Volturi and other ancient vampires, etc., are all there and she has chosen to walk away from it. I get it, one could get tired of writing about vampires all the time, but that ache is lessened considerably with being able to play with any character, in any time period. One note characters? Write books about them. I'd love to go into battle with Emmett. Or meet the woman Aro chose for his wife. What is her story? Were there any vampires in Marie Antoinette's court? You don't just invent a certifiable nut case like Aro, and leave him as an afterthought in a Bella novel. The same goes for Jane. Burned alive as a witch, then rescued by Aro and turned into a vampire? I would pay good money to read that book, maybe even the $7.99 I wasted on this novella. (Do I regret reading it? No. But it's not worth $8. It takes 2 hours to read on Kindle.) \n Bree Tanner is the vampire girl who surrendered to Carlisle in \"Eclipse\" and was sentenced to die by Jane just for the hell of it. (Jane says \"rules, rules,\" but I say, \"awesome, fabulous, evil Jane, just having fun,\" and I'm right. Bitch does things for the hell of it.) The concept is great. We already know the end of Bree's story - death. The clock is ticking, as the hourglass on the front cover so ominously reminds us. This is the chance to see things from someone other than Bella's perspective. In some regards, it works, at least with Jane. Bree's insights into her are a bit more concise than Bella's. It's a sweet little story but suffers a lot from what bugs me most about the other \"Twilight\" books - too much internal pondering (telling), not enough action (showing). Bree lives mostly in her head. She reasons things out, she figures them out, and she's fairly smart (... but also oblivious, which is remarkable). \n The writing peruses some things in depth and skims over others. The violence is sometimes graphic but never truly emotional on a level that would be wonderfully disturbing. And, for me, it opens too late in Bree's un-life. I wanted to read about Bree's \"changing\" experience, since we never really got that from Bella. I wanted the venom rushing through her veins, the awakening with unbearable thirst, the pure bloodlust. I wanted to feel her die - the first time and the second. I wanted some actual battle scenes instead of Bree coming in just late enough to see the debris. The lackluster approach to climaxes is a pattern in these books. \"Twilight\" - a decent climax, a good fight scene. \"New Moon\" - the climax is seeing the Volturi, which is fascinating but hardly action-packed, considering all they do is stand around and talk. \"Eclipse\" - most of the action we hear about second-hand. \"Breaking Dawn\" has 40 pages of dialogue and Bella flexing her \"shield\" but no big knock-down, tear-up fight with the Volturi like I hoped for. (Why are people afraid of the Volturi? What do they do, TALK people to death? Other than set a couple of vampires on fire, I've never seen them DO anything.) And here, Bree comes in after it's mostly over. Great ideas, good storytelling, but not a lot of delivery at the end. \n I love revisiting this world from a different perspective (yet another reason I wish the author hadn't shelved writing the books from Edward's point of view...) but I wish it had been a little bit... more. More what? Just more. More in depth. More brutal. More honest. More emotionally gripping. Something."}

{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n As with Eragon, this is a by the numbers Hero's Journey (specifically Star Wars) that is so faithful and predictable that it feels like a different type of story. This is Empire Strikes Back, but with dragons and sailing ships. But the author takes that skeleton and creates an interesting, consistent, and enjoyable world on top of it. \n One thing I enjoyed about this book, that's not usually in other fantasy books, is the inclusion of modern topics. The Varden's financial problems and solution provide some economic realism not usually in this sort of book. Also, King Orrin as gentleman chemist makes perfect sense, given how Alagaesia is similar to the early Industrialization era, but with magic in place of technology. \n I enjoy reading these books and what they lack in story structure originality, they make up for in descriptive writing and world building."}

{"text": "This volume brings together of Pierce's short stories, some new and some older, into a single collection. Her usual themes of teenage and pre-teen girls kicking butt, friendships across cultural divides, and menageries of fantastical beasts are here in plenty. Many of the stories take place in the familiar world of her Tortall books, and include several beloved characters (Daine, Numair and Kitten make an appearance, as do Aly and Nawat Crow). Most of the stories are simple and straight-forward, though many are moving. I especially liked the semi-autobiographical tale of the new house-mother at a girls' home. Overall, it was a pleasant read, but I don't think I would actively recommend it to any but teens and die-hard Pierce fans. \n A review of the short story \"Elder Brother\", which appears in this volume: \n In one of Tammy's books (Wolf Speaker), there is a scene wherein a mage turns an enemy into a tree, with the repercussion that somewhere in the world, a tree became a man. Set against the backdrop of a culture resembling radical Islam, this is the story of Qoim, an innocent apple tree, and what became of him. Because it is only a short story, there isn't the time for Qoim to gradually learn a lot of things, so Tammy takes the shortcut of having the mage magically plant knowledge in his brain, by way of apology. Unable to truly understand humans, Qoim resolves to die, until he meets Fadal, who is not all he seems either. I enjoyed this story, and would love to see Qoim and Fadal show up in Tammy's other books, as the story hints they might. Definitely a good story for ages 12 and up."}

{"text": "This is a sweet and different M/M shifter romance. \n Lon and Corey are newly coupled--just moved in together--and are working out all the kinks. As is normal for a new couple they need to figure out who's gonna do the household chores, and how they're going to manage car use and date night activities--but these \"usual\" issues are complicated by one simple fact: Lon is an otter shifter. \n Every week he needs to spend some time in his otter form, 1-5 hours generally scratches that itch, while longer than 12 hours of otter fun has Lon lost in a haze between both worlds where the water is his best friend and all he wants to do is play. See, when he's an otter, Lon's really an otter--lost in his otterness. He hunts and behaves like and otter--even if it means eating the decorative koi he and Corey put into the pond out back, or shredding all the toilet paper rolls in the house. \n In his human form, Lon's a loan officer for a Boulder bank, and he's not happy when a trio of werewolves appear at his desk for a loan to fund building the Full Moon Conservancy on forestry land. Lon knows that the property is part of the protected habitat of the silverscale dace, an endangered indigenous fish, and that's part of why he declines to approve the loan--approval can only come after the environmental impact studies. \n Some problems? Werewolves don't like to be told no. Also, the alpha of the pack, Melvin, is Corey's department chair at U-Colorado. He recognizes Lon's scent on Corey, and that's a whole new dimension of TMI. Lon fears that the werewolves will eradicate the dace from their property, or kill Corey, or himself, and takes some bold strokes to prevent that--little does he know the werewolves have a dastardly plan to get rid of the dace \"naturally\" with the help of a few hungry otters... \n What I really enjoyed about this story is the in-depth characterization of Lon, and Corey. They both have to deal with the otterness of Lon, and Corey's doing his darnedest without knowing truly how to help Lon. Because Lon's pretty protective about the ins and outs of shifting. In some ways it seems that Lon doesn't actually KNOW the answers to the questions Corey poses, because he's a whole different being as an otter and this is not translatable. Like, there aren't words much when he's an otter. And, if he's an otter for several hours Lon loses his ability to speak when he pulls his fur back. \n As Lon deals with the werewolves, Corey tries his best, though it's not good enough. Lingering effects of shifting threaten to pull Lon into otterness forever, and it's all Corey can do to keep him on this side of the pelt. It was a great psychological story, and I loved the development of the relationship between them. Poor Lon, who loves the tasty koi! Poor Corey, who doesn't know how to deal with a truly wild mate! \n They are a great pair. The pace of the story, and the switching POV both hit the mark for me. I liked the sexytimes, and the emotional context for this couple felt right. They are still getting acquainted--they've only dated a couple of months, and the growing pains of coupledom had authenticity."}
{"text": "This is a good story. I really liked the premise of it - an ordinary guy, Nathan, finds himself in a position of having superhero powers. With his powers he is able to save people just in the nick of time however he is not always successful. Simple things put him in the place of not being able to use his powers to save others. He flounders as he has no rules and no direction, so he has to figure it out pretty much as he goes. It makes you wonder who you'd save if you had those superpowers? Nathan is put to the ultimate test of having to choose one thing over another (sorry no spoilers). Somewhere, however I got disconnected from the characters, especially Nathan. I'm not sure why but I think that he was somewhat detached from what he was doing, the emotional journey didn't seem to be there. This is a first in a series, so it will be interesting to see where the author takes the story."}

This, and the wildfires that are threatening the kingdom, may give Daja the chance she longs for to earn her place as a Trader again. But only if she is willing to leave behind her new friends. \n I've enjoyed this book best so far of this quartet. Daja's story is touching, and her character seems slightly more three-dimensional than some of the others."}

When her friend Chubs was shot, she called in the people that she'd been running from since she broke out of her 'rehabilitation' camp - the Children's League. They agreed to help her, but with a price. She had to come and work for them and she made one more condition. They had to let Liam - her boyfriend - go. And she did one other hard thing. She wiped Liam's memory of anything that had to deal with her and sent him on his way. Now, six months later, she is deep into the Children's League, but even they are not safe. Psi Kids are getting killed in action and its being written off as an accident. Ruby and her team - including Cate - are trying to figure out what is going on when Cole Stewart - Liam's brother - comes to Ruby with a new mission for her. \n The reason he got picked up was because Liam made contact with him to try and find their parents. It got called in and Cole got picked up instead of his brother. But Liam when he ran took vital intel that could help the League go back to its old ways. Now, Ruby has to find the one person she thought that she was never going to see again. But she quickly learns that even though she has control over other people's minds, sometimes things never fade... \n I'm always worried about sequels to books that I really liked, because a good chunk of the time, the next one doesn't live up to its predecessor. As I started Never Fade, it looked like that was going to be the case."}

{"text": "Oh annoying and selfish Bella, why did I ever liked you? I really don't get why, to make things more complicated in the love department, Meyer makes of the main character the more selfish, disgusting and insufferable person of all times. You may wonder, why did I read this saga, if I don'r like it? I don't want to offend anyone by this critique, I respect anyone who enjoyed this book. But to me, a true heroine is one that fights and sacrifice herself for the ones she loves, that would do anything to see her friends and family happy, and that speaks her mind and wants to take actions to change the things that are wrong. But here, all I find is everyone protecting her, as she only thinks of what she wants and cant care about anyone else at all. Well, she says she cares, but can't do anything to stop making Edward and Jacob suffer, or help her new family fighting vampires. I do like other characters, so I finished this saga to see what happens with them, but its really sad for me that Meyer's opinion of love is so passionate yet lacking of any real care for one another."}

Meanwhile, brutal and monstrous forces are gathering on the horizon, intent on enslaving her world.

Unfortunately, that paragraph does NOT do this book justice. Heir of Fire is by far one of my favorites of the series.

{"text": "I neither loved nor hated this book and I was surprised about that since it tends to bring out very strong emotions in people. \n I'm going to be doing a full review on this book, but wanted to touch on a few things here since it is such a controversial read. \n Firstly, I've always planned on reading this entire series regardless of if I hated the first book. Especially because this series should honestly just be one book. All of the books are short enough to combine. \n Secondly, yes OBVIOUSLY trigger warnings for rape, abuse, pedophilia, etc. Most people know that going in by now. And maybe I was over prepared, but this book isn't nearly as brutal as I was prepared for it to be. If you don't have those warnings before going in, maybe it is. But not as bad as I was expecting. Yes, the world is very different than ours. All of the countries have slaves. All of the countries have pleasure slaves. Rape is a prominent thing. But there is definitely more grey area and room for discussion of consent in this world than one might think going in, and that's probably why opinions on this series are so black and white. \n Lastly, THIS BOOK IS NOT A ROMANCE. Now that all books are out, we know that's the direction it goes. But there is no romance in this book at all. I'm actually really interested to see how this series goes about its redemption arcs and how so many people come to love Laurent. Because yeah, he's an asshole. So what is done to possibly redeem him?!? I'm intrigued to see how that is attempted and if it is successful in my eyes, because I'm super skeptical. \n The writing in this is nothing to write home about. It's definitely over the top at times and stumbles into \"fanfiction AU\" territory with some of its tropes. But it is very easy to read because of that. \n That was a lot more than I planned on writing but oh well. I'm committed to the rest of this series so we'll see which side I land on in the end."}
{"text": "2.5 stelle goodreads \n Ho appena finito Opal ed il mio commento a caldo e: Aridaje Armentrout! \n Per quanto mi riguarda la serie Lux e stata un escalation in negativo, dato che soltanto il primo capitolo (Obsidian) mi era piaciuto. Con Onyx avevo avuto qualche problemino... \n Piu che altro per colpa del personaggio di Kat: insignificante ed irritante sotto tutti i punti di vista. Infatti ho chiuso un occhio sulle sfacciate similitudini con la saga della Meyer, non ho prestato attenzione al modo dell'autrice di spiegare, in maniera poco chiara, alcuni passaggi... ed ho glissato sulla mancanza di incisivita degli antagonisti; soltanto perche non mi piace lasciare una saga in asso. \n Armata di una esigua dose di aspettative e speranzosa che la Armentrout potesse stupirmi in bene, ho intrapreso la lettura di Opal. \n Aspettative deluse e trama ancora piu sconclusionata della precedente! \n Le \"prime\" 150 pagine hanno come tema predominante i litigi, le smancerie, gli sbaciucchiamenti ed i tira e molla tra Daemon e Katy; resi ancora piu snervanti dalla presenza dei due clockblocker Andrew e Dee. \n Una serie di insignificanti paturnie di Katy, compensate un po' dalla dolce gelosia di Daemon, che pero hanno reso noiosa e lentissima piu della meta del libro. \n L'azione e convogliata nelle ultime 80 pagine, nelle quali i nostri protagonisti si lanciano in un'impresa, palesemente suicida e che puzza di trappola. \n Trama scontata, personaggi poco credibili e resi talvolta ridicoli da situazioni assurde, stile scialbo e lento... Un cliffangher talmente prevedibile che non ha suscitato in me alcuna reazione. \n Daemon e veramente dolcissimo, il suo personaggio ha subito una serie di radicali cambiamenti, che lo hanno reso piu \"umano\" e adorabile! \n Concludendo Opal non e riuscito ad intrigarmi, anzi mi ha decisamente annoiata!"}

{"text": "3.5 stars actually \n It was not up to the standards of Sweet Evil in my opinion. Mainly because there were huge breaks in time within the writing which made it hard for me to follow. It dragged on on for a long time and when the action came, it was unexpected. Did anybody else notice that all the action came whenever Kaidan was with Anna??? When she was alone, nothing ever happened to her. But I love Kaidan. The ending was came out of the blue. I kept on expecting more to happen. But I think this is just all a matter of preference and I wasn't suited to reading this writing style. \n The story follows Anna, who recently discovered she was the daughter of Belial (Duke/Demon) and also of a guardian angel. She's also discovered that her life is endangered if she, as a nephilim, refuses to corrupt other people through alcohol and drugs. So Anna decides to embrace her inner party girl to save her own life (You have to admit, that is a little bit fun.) \n Now if this bad luck wasn't enough for Anna, she broke up with Kaidan Rowe, her true love, her soul mate, the light of her life etc. Devastated, Anna's doing all she can to get him back even though this can possibly endanger her life. \n And then a prophecy arrives because, as everybody knows, a novel which involves the doing of heaven and hell, demons and guardian angels needs a bloody prophecy. This prophecy states that Anna is the one to take down the demon hierarchy and free all nephilim etc. Is it just me, or is this starting to sound like Harry Potter?? Maybe I should start calling her Harriet. \n So pretty much all Anna can do, is raise an BLOODY ARMY OF NEPHILIM to fulfil this prophecy, because that's easy. Everyone can do that. At the end of the novel, Anna officially has six members in her army. Six members to take down every single Duke. Who says that logic isn't faulty? \n And the worst thing I can say about this novel is that Kaidan, the hottest YA nephilim ever, isn't even around for half the novel. Half the novel He was the best thing about this trilogy. But I forgive him, because, hell, who can't forgive him when he says these adorably sweet things like- \n \"I was more myself with you during those three days than I've ever been with anyone in my life. It'd be easier if I could be fake with you, but you bring out everything in me, little Ann. All of it.\" \n \"I love you,\" I whispered. \n \"I've loved you longer,\" he said.\" \n I wish that Wendy Higgins didn't make him a drummer but a singer. Imagine that gorgeous voice just singing to you on your iPod. Yum. For all that Kaidan goes on about him not being worthy enough for Anna, it's the other way around. Kaidan is clearly too good for Anna (even though she is apparently a virginal heroine who despises swear words and never thinks a bad thing in her entire life). \n He does all this romantically wonderful stuff for her that it's impossibly hard to believe that Kaidan has been indulging in \"sin\" for all the years of his life. \n This is a good book, but I'll only be reading the next book if it has more of Kaidan in it."}
{"text": "Darnn. I would've given this 2 stars but I'm so into all the characters that I feel bad doing so. \n Anyway, the ending evoked a silent 'are you kidding me' from me but tbh, I already kind of expected it. Haha."}
{"text": "The characters are predictable to a T, and I found some of the topics in the book written for younger readers but over their head to a point. \n I was more then halfway through the book when I realized the book wasn't going to go anywhere and I'd have to read the second one. I didn't like that if left off in such an obvious cliffhanger. \n A lot of potential maybe the author grows. But I don't think this book has the crossover appeal to adults like it's looking for."}
{"text": "This is the second book in a series, and should be read after KICK AT THE DARKNESS. Some mild spoilers for KICK AT THE DARKNESS included below. \n It's contemporary times, but it's also the end of times. The world was infected with a virus that has decimated the population and turned the infected into mindless zombies. Adam and Parker were students at Stanford, Adam a 23 y/o films studies grad student, and Parker an 18 y/o freshman in Adam's class when everything went bananas. They escaped California on Adam's motorcycle and headed east, to see if Parker's family survived the carnage. Along the way they were attacked, fell for each other, confessed some startling secrets, got over themselves, were held hostage, escaped from real and present dangers--many times--and hit the coast. Only to discover Parker's family long gone. \n They bundled up and took off for safety in a yacht, and that's where Fight the Tide picks up. Parker and Adam are making their way south along the east coast. Parker is a trained sailor; his family owned a yacht and he sailed regularly in his childhood. That said, he's never made such a long trip without more skilled partners--his father and elder brother--and he knows going into the open ocean is a very dangerous prospect. Staying close to shore isn't easy either. It's nearing the end of hurricane season, but storms could disable their boat, or send it crashing to the shore. Being near the coast allows them to drop into port now and again to scavenge supplies. Adam, who is a werewolf, always makes these trips as he's immune to the virus, and his heightened strength and senses allow him to avoid or overcome any zombies that attack. That doesn't help Parker, alone on the boat, when pirates board. \n Despite Parker's general wariness, he helps rescue a boat in a storm, picking up two adults and their kids. This companionship is mostly welcome, especially by Adam, who is a drifter and grateful for any pack he can cobble together. Adam and the other adults want to make sail for Salvation Island, a place not on any of Parker's maps, yet whose beacons come across the radio frequencies every evening. Parker's sure it's another trap, and is adamantly against, but circumstances force even his will--when he needs to get help for one of his passengers. \n There is constant action in this book. It's a rollicking ride, with danger lurking from page-to-page. Parker isn't good with people, and his suspicious nature is bolstered with each new tragedy. He's also haunted by the pirate attack, and he's ashamed that he can't move past it. Adam's a bulwark, but he can't be everything for Parker. Plus, the calls of Salvation Island prove to be a siren song he has trouble resisting. I think if Adam had the ability to sail that far, he'd have forced Parker's hand much sooner. \n Despite the harrowing plot, there is still a strong romance here. Parker and Adam are two men in love, and they take great pleasure exploring their relationship in ways that were soopa-hawt. Serious. I had to stop and fan myself at times. As the book drew near it's end, I was glad to watch Parker and Adam make it to safety, even as the seeds for a third book were clearly sown. Safety shouldn't be the only goal, in Adam's mind, not when there are so many humans struggling. I foresee a werewolf invasion, one that liberates humans and hopefully helps eradicate the virus--but that's my own hope! Also, the author has mentioned a fourth, related, book, and I expect it will involve one of Parker's rescues--Jacob--who will *fingers crossed* find a safe haven and partner down the road. \n For paranormal/post-apocalyptic stories, this one's really on the contemporary-realistic side of those genres. There's little shifting, and the zombie menace is easy to imagine. I liked the elements of sailing included here, and thought it reflected a wealth of carefully-collected and sparingly delivered knowledge of actual sailing. I never felt overwhelmed by it; and I grasped how dangerous it was--in a way I had never really expected. In short, it felt so real, I could nearly taste the salty ocean spray on my face. I'm so in on this series, I might need to take drastic measures to get book 3 as soon as possible. Highly recommend!"}
{"text": "Branna and Fin had been young lovers, until the curse mark came onto Fin's skin permanently, denoting him as a descendant from Cabhan. Seeing this mark, Branna feels betrayed from there on out, so she kept her distance. Though her heart had other ideas. Fin is her first and only love so it was a struggle to accept that he's part of the circle to defeat Cabhan. \n I liked Fin's character. He is who he is and doesn't pretend otherwise. Although he's marked by a demon, he's good through and through. He also fought hard staying away from Branna, but no matter how far he runs, she haunts him. \n As for the story, there seems to be a theme going on in this book. \n The characters have a run in with Cahban, they all meet to debrief, and Branna cooks and clean. Rinse and repeat. That in itself made the book quite repetitive and predictable. \n Things got a little interesting towards the end with a transfer of power, but overall, still a quick and tidy ending. \n What I think lacked in this book compared to her other paranormal trilogies is that the villain didn't seem overly evil. So it lacked that impact each time he attacks the group. We get a tiny glimpse into his history but not enough to make him standout. \n As a whole, not my favorite trilogy but still an okay read."}

I didn't know if this would be a smash hit like the first book or if it'd be an 'ok' book like the second. What I experienced was a little of both. \n The snippy, sassy Alexia is back in this book, which is something readers didn't really see a lot of in the second book. \n The plot moved extremely fast and there were a few exciting moments involved (flying ladybugs anyone?). \n I did speed through this book. I read it in about 2 days and quickly wanted to know what would happen next. There were a few unexpected plot twists, which helped keep my attention. \n I did find the Templars to be a bit frustrating, and a large majority of the book is spent talking about how a child could be possible (which honestly should have been obvious to everyone)."}
{"text": "Just OK. The book didn't need to be nearly as long as it was - there's just not a lot of story here. The first solid third of the book was Fitz being visited by various people and chatting with them. It gets old. It really does. \n [minor spoilers] \n So, a few issues. First, like I said above, the actual story of the book is restricted to less than half of it. I get that we need to catch up with the protagonist, but man does it drag. \n Also, the majority of the characters in the book are just unlikeable. I've never loved The Fool but he just seemed obnoxious in this one. Aside from Fitz and one new character (Jinna) I couldn't really stand anyone. \n That said, it had it's moments and the end left me at least mildly interested in the next book, though I think I'll be taking a break from the series."}

{"text": "Rowling really hits it out of the park with the characters and story in this volume. It is not bogged down by scenes involving Voldemort.

{"text": "I don't think I can even describe the strange high pitched squealing noises that came out of me when I got my hands on this book. I just knew it was going to be amazing. Epic. Entertaining. \n It was all of those things, but it was so, so much more. \n Mariko is the daughter of a prominent Samurai and has been groomed all her life for a political marriage that would elevate her father's status. A marriage is arranged between Mariko and Minamato Raiden, the son of the Emperor and his favorite consort. On her way to the city of Inako, the imperial city, her entire party is ambushed and killed by the Black Clan. Except Mariko. While escaping the ambush, she learns that someone hired the Black Clan to kill her before she could reach the palace in Inako. Knowing that if she returns home, she would lose her opportunity to learn who wants her dead, Mariko devises a plan. First step? Infiltrate the Black Clan. Before she can put her plan into motion, she is taken prisoner by the Black Clan. To survive, Mariko relies on her keen intelligence and is forced to live beyond the well protected existence she had before. The more time she spends with the Black Clan, the more she questions everything she thought she knew, including who is in the right, who is in the wrong, and the many shades in between. \n In the meantime, Mariko's brother Kenshin, known as the Dragon of Kai, searches for her in the Juaki Forest, where he finds reason to believe that Mariko did not die with the rest of her party. He begins his own search for answers. \n The book shifts POVs and we see the web of deception that connects each of the characters and the consequences of their actions. This book is about power in all its forms. Each character, whether it's Mariko, Kenshin, the various members of the Black Clan, the Emperor, or even the Emperor's wife, struggle for power of some kind. Political power, the power to protect, power over their own destiny, power over one's body, or power over another. Each person has to decide what they are willing to sacrifice to gain said power. \n Mariko's character is multifaceted, vivid, and flawed. Her strength lies in her wits and intelligence. Like a gifted chess player, she is always a few steps ahead of everyone around her and easily sees through the machinations of others. She quickly learns that while that might have been enough to thrive in her sheltered noble life, it takes more than that to survive with the Black Clan. Her growth as a person is natural and necessary, and she blossoms into this brilliant bad ass. Braver. Stronger. I loved it. \n \"Mariko was not afraid anymore. As her time with the Black Clan had taught her, avoiding fear made her weak. Embracing it made her strong.\" \n I want to get into the Black Clan and dissect each character but I feel that a large part of the joy of this book was going in pretty blind. I'm the kind of person that tends to read way too many reviews before reading a book, so this was really nice for a change. That and the fact going into everything I want to say would probably lengthen this review by an entire page. I feel like it's pretty long already, so I'm not even going to try. \n The writing was just...stunning. There was a beautiful balance between sparse, direct sentences and entire passages of breathtaking imagery. Everything was written with a simple elegance that allowed so much to be said with so little. And what was said, was just beautiful. \n \"Its petal pink waters were a painted stroke separating the tiled roofs on either shoreline-a swell of blue-grey clay, rising like the sea, bandied about by a storm.\" \n There were surprising moments of wisdom that I found myself reading over and over again, trying to commit them to memory. Good thing I finally realized there is this awesome thing called paper. You know, so you don't have to memorize things. There is everything here. Romance. Magic. Mystery. Heart-pounding action. \n The plot obviously bears a great resemblance to Mulan, which is fantastic. I'm less familiar with Mulan than other Disney movies, not because I didn't like it as much (I loved it) but because I didn't own it. So I've only seen it a few times. Everything I loved about it is here, but there is so much more. There is quite literally nothing I didn't love about this book. All the stars! \n *I received an ARC in exchange for a fair and honest review. Any quotes above are subject to change."}

I just finished it minutes ago and I want to review about what I thought about the book. \n First of all, the story is about Jacob Portman who grew up listening to his grandfather's stories, but then several years later as he grew up her began to not believe his \"fairy tales\" and treated him like everybody else. Though one day, his grandfather gets attacked by \"monsters\" and he tells Jacob to go to a woman named Miss Peregrine. He discovers the secrets his grandfather never told him before he died, and that the fairy tales are real -- and they are alive. \n The story was a mixed of the ordinary life and the strange life. For me, it was a bit dragging. The author just didn't go straight to the point. Jacob's character was not expressed well. I love all of the characters of this book, their talents and the fact that they are really peculiar. The book is rather dark and fun at the same time. The book only has 11 chapters and because of that I was getting bored. All in all, the book was splendid written, and peculiar. I suggest everyone to read this book \n OK, 11 months later, I can say that this book was not my cup of tea. The only interesting features about this book are the pictures, probably because there are a lot of YA books without pictures. As I said 11 months ago, it was \"dragging\" and I was \"getting bored.\""}

{"text": "See full review for Demonglass at: http://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.w... \n Life has been difficult for Sophie Mercer the last year. She found out that she was a witch, a dark witch, and then ultimately a demon. The guy she had a crush on turned out to be a member of The Eye - a group of people who hunt and kill Prodigium. It's been six months since she killed her psycho demon grandmother Alice, and decided to go through the process of Removal. Now, she's just waiting on her dad, the head of the Council to come and whisk her away to London so that she can go through this process. \n But he gives her an ultimatum instead. Spend the summer with him and after that if she still wants to get rid of her powers he'll approve her decision. She agrees if she can bring her vampire friend Jenna along with her. In London, she discovers that things outside of Hecate aren't as peachy as the headmistress has made it out to be. Other than her father and herself, there are two other demon children - Daisy and Nick - and they're staying at the Council's new headquarters because The Eye burned the old one down months ago. And the Eye has teamed up again with one of the Brannicks so a war between them and the Prodigium is inevitable. Then there's also the unresolved issue of Archer Cross that she has to face when he saves her life one night. What's a girl to do?"}
{"text": "They should really put a moritorium on the convention known as time travel. I think when writers use it, it's a McGuffin-esque crutch, that when wielded poorly, makes for a predictable and mediocre story. ASTP was okay, but would have greatly benefited from a family tree, as the story basically revolves around two bloodlines, with similar, if not identical names between generational characters. It became a chore to keep track of who was who, and detracted from the overall book."}

{"text": "Highly recommended \n Umm WHAT?! That was such an awesome ending and a cliffhanger! This series has pretty much consumed my entire reading time. I said I was going to take it slowly so that I can just keep going till book 6 comes out, but from how it looks like, I will be done with the 5th book and impatiently waiting. No regrets though. I am thoroughly enjoying reading about Leeds's adventures with her friends."}
{"text": "This book was sheer fun and was so imaginative that I couldn't put it down. I liked the map at the beginning of the book, the time table at the end, the twist on the origanl Alice in Wonderland story, and all the other very nice visual details that made this book fun to read."}
{"text": "This is the second book in a series, but I read it out of order and had no problems with the storyline. \n This book is set in the fantastical realm of Cloudburst Falls, West Virginia in a contemporary time period with the addition of magic, mobs and mayhem. Okay, so really it's only magic that's a game changer. In this bookscape, there are people who possess magical Talents, like super speed, strengths, divination etc. There are also magical creatures--which are highly concentrated in the mountainous area of Clouburst Falls, or so says the tourism board. Still, lochnesses, tree trolls and copper crushers are part of the fauna, and one must know how to deal with these creatures in order to get on. \n Lila Merriweather is not who she claims to be, and there are few who know the secret of her identity. She was born Lila Sterling, child of Serena Sterling, a powerful woman who fled Cloudburst Falls after Lila's father was murdered by his benefactor, Victor Draconi--head of the Draconi Family and the same dude who later murdered Serena, stealing her magical Talents. \n Lila wants to avenge her parents, but she's only 17 and still honing her magic, plus she knows it would be a suicide mission to take out the head of the most powerful Family in Cloudburst Falls. Instead, she's the personal bodyguard of Devon Sinclair--son of Claudia Sinclair and second-in-command of the Sinclair Family. Lila recently saved Devon from certain death and is just getting used to her new position in the Family, as she's been living on her own and stealing for a living since her mother's murder four years ago. Also, she's totally gaga for Devon, and he for her, but she holds off on making anything physical because she has lost too many people close to her to let Devon get in close. \n This book is the set-up before the major clash between the Sinclair and Draconi families. We learn, intimately, just how underhanded the Draconis can be--and how ruthless some of these people in this world are. \n The set-up is a tournament, which is meant to showcase all the Talents of the Families to themselves and the tourists. It's a major attraction and has been won by Deah Draconi for the past two years. Deah's not the biggest or strongest, but her mimic magic is a distinct edge. Devon and Lila are part of the competition this year, as is Katia Volkov--an outsider who comes down from New York to compete. She lost to Deah the past two years and is angling to win it all. \n I really liked the bit of mystery that was woven into the story. Lila and Devon notice that the magical monsters are moving around, coming out from their normal habitats into areas that are more highly populated. This seems to be a defensive move because they also find many carcasses strewn about the woods, with suspicious markings and clearly malicious stab wounds. I had the culprit and motive pinpointed early on, but that didn't mean I wasn't happy with the reveal. Also, it made for some good suspense. \n Lila has a lot to learn about the Family life, but she embraces the affection and support given so freely by the Sinclairs. Her mother and Claudia had been best friends in their girlhood, and Claudia is happy to have Lila with her. Of course, there are lots of secrets about Lila's mother, and who best to relate them than Serena's sister--not that Lila knew she had an aunt. Or a cousin, one who is poised to become her enemy and her ally. That twist was really excellent, and also sets up the next book stunningly. \n Lila is a dark horse to win the tournament, but she performs exceedingly well, and it's hers to lose. I won't reveal any of that, but the depth of empathy Lila exhibits in the course of competition made her truly likable as a character. I liked that the love story between Lila and Devon is a side issue, one that Lila continues to set to the side, because her duty lies elsewhere. She has the right mindset, and I was glad that she behaved like a woman with a brain, and also a heart. I'm looking forward the next book. \n I received a review copy of this book via NetGalley."}
{"text": "I received this book in exhange for an honest review. \n Rating: 2.5 stars. \n Pain and Jane are two sisters working for an organization, patroling New York city and doing missions for payment. But they're not normal teenagers: they are ghosts. They have extraordinary abilities, enhanced senses and they can fly. \n One night, they hear a scream and see ghosts that work for an evil organization, with two humans, discussing if they should kill them or kidnap them. So, they decide to save them and take them to their organization, and protect them until they can figure out why the leader of this evil organization, Eugene, want them. \n Dave and Chester have no idea wich one of them is the target, and why. But now they are in dangers, and only the ghosts can protect them. \n My favorite characters were Jane and Skull. Pain was... horrible. Let me just quote this: \n \"He tried to imagine what she was like before that relationship, then; could she be attentive and kind, more like Jane? Patient, gentle, romantic? He quickly shook his head, as if trying to shake off all of those ideas. It just wouldn't be her\" \n If by \"her\" you mean rude, bad tempered, selfish, arrogant, inmatture, brute and selfcentered. \n I could list all the things that bothered me about this book, but I think it just wasn't my cup of tea. 3 of the 4 main characters annoyed me to no ends, and I found them selfish and inmature. The plot was ok, but I felt \n most of the time it didn't really make any sense to me."}
{"text": "Justice Calling (The Twenty-Sided Sorceress #1) by Annie Bellet \n Justice Calling is the first in The Twenty-Sided Sorcerer series featuring sorcerer/gamer/nerd Jade Crow. I love nerd fantasy. (The technical genre is 'litRPG'.) That said, while I loved the jokes and Jade as a character, there were some elements that I wanted in Justice Calling that just weren't there. \n First, and this is a big one for me, Jade and her friends are nerds but they never do anything nerdy in this story. Jade paints some orc figurines, but this story could've used a scene where Jade and her friends nerded out. They needed to go Full Nerd, and I would've believed this entire world and story more. They could've watched a movie. Or had a LAN party or cos-played or anything. There were lots of nerd jokes and deftly laid references, and Jade's first person POV convinced me she was a nerd, but the plot never slows quite enough to establish Jade's friends (Levi, Ezee, and Harper) as actual characters. The villains were just as thin, but whatever, they were clearly the starter pack villains for this series. The overall 'meh' towards everyone else Jade interacted with made it difficult to feel invested in anyone Jade talked to. \n I liked Jade a lot. I didn't believe her romance with Alek at all (ah, the character problems continue). I was more interested in her failed (and probably creepy and definitely abusive) relationship with her ex, the sorcerer Samir, than anything she did with Alek. Alek is a Justice, a shape-shifter Super Cop, and he has a vision that Jade is going to be the catalyst for the death of many shape-shifters. This is the Plot Kick-off, and that's all that really happens on that front. Alek shows up and says 'hey, there's a prophecy about you and now I have to stalk you' and somehow Jade is completely okay with this. Sure. Whatever. A sorcerer (probably connected to Samir) targets shape-shifters, freezing them in their animal form and stealing their powers. Jade's past as a sorcerer becomes relevant--she has the power to stop them but that would come at a gross price (eating hearts). \n This story reminds me a lot of how The Dresden Files started--not particularly strong on the plot front and with some woefully or weirdly underdeveloped side characters--but with a strong main character personality. If book two gets better, I think I could like this series quite a bit, but there needs to be another character I care about besides Jade for me to stick with this series. Still, this book is worth the read as the starter pack for a hopefully more interesting story that revolves around Jade and the shifter world. \n Rating: 3 stars. I liked the main character and world building ground work, but I didn't love the other characters or really get a sense of who they were. That ruined a lot of moments for me."}
{"text": "I would probably rate this book 3 stars. Okay, so let's start this review; first off, I loved how the author was able to have several different sub-plots going on at once with all the different characters and not have it all end up in confusion. She pulled it off, which is probably a hard thing to do, but she did it. That's not to say that I didn't have any issues with this book, because there were a lot. First off, it was pretty inconsistent now that I think about it. It's just the little things, like for example Simon and Isabelle's relationship. Honestly, I thought they were already dating by the time this book started but no, they were still in the confusion zone of almost boyfriend and girlfriend, but not quite there yet. Really? Like, even at the end of the book, after all the intimate moments they shared, they're STILL not dating? And neither of them is apparently bright enough to figure out that they both love each other? Did the stuff that happened in the previous books not matter either? That's not to say that their relationship was probably the saving grace of this book for me... . \n Also, the author uses the same adjectives/phrases for probably every character. Honestly, how many times do you need to tell us Jace is golden, or Sebastian has Valentine's hair and it suits him better than when he dyed it black? \n And Clary and Jace. Just,...really? REALLY? They were beyond annoying for most of this book, although there WERE some moments in which they were tolerable. Clary was SO selfish and their romance just resembles Edward's and Bella's from Twilight so much. \n Jace: I hurt you, I can't be with you anymore now, even though I love \n you and want to be with you! It's all my fault that you got hurt! (Mind you that I had this annoyance since the start of the series, surprisingly Jace wasn't the culprit in this book though!) \n Clary: I don't care if you want to die! I love you too much and i'm so selfish that i'm going to make everything worse! I'm going to ignore what everyone tells me to do because I can't lose you; I love you so much that I can't live without you! (Really Clary? *sarcasm* How did you possibly survive before Jace came into your life? Clary was fine throughout the series but recently she's starting to annoy the crap out of me.) \n I have mixed feelings about how the author wrote about one couple or some group of characters and their adventure and then end the chapter on a cliffhanger. And then the next chapter...SURPRISE! starts right off with a different group of characters...like how she wrote about Simon and Isabelle and then suddenly alternates back to Jace and Clary...Although, at first I was incredibly annoyed, eventually I would warm up and start to get sucked into an adventure only to have the whole process repeat itself. \n But honestly, Isabelle and Simon...DAWWWW THEY'RE SO CUTE! Favorite couple (are they even an official couple?) from the series!"}

{"text": "A friend gave me a bunch of her epub files and this was one of the books. I had never heard of Sheri Tepper and so came to the book with little or no expectations. This book had a really slow start but something in it kept me reading, despite not really being engaged for the first few chapters. Eventually though it started to really interest me. Tepper's development of the idea of how a society develops, how ideals become corrupted and a few wrestle power was well portrayed. The language used and the story told by Queen Stephanie seemed to be a Maori story and the language Maori. I wondered, given that Tepper is American if the Hawaiian language is similar to Maori but didn't think it resembled so closely. Love the metaphor of a planet having a song. \n Haven't finished yet - just up to the part where Genevieve has been kidnapped by Zeb in the caverns. But spent a few minutes this morning educating myself of Sheri Tepper who was more famous than my ignorance warranted. \n The mystery kept me going well after I felt the soporific effects of a too long book! The main characters kind of lost focus after the mystery was revealed and I did have to slog to the end but there were aspects of brilliance that saw me through. It was a well conceived story and I'm looking forward to reading more of her books."}
{"text": "I loved Farwalker's Quest so my expectations for this book were really really high. I am very proud to say that this book is just as good if not better then FQ. There are new characters that are introduced which allow for a fresh voice to the story, yet the older characters are still there and growing which is great. \n Another great thing about this book is that all the questions that came up in FQ are answered. The people's callings are explored further and readers get to learn more about what being a Farwalker means which is great. \n There is also a bit more about the whole concept of things going missing. Which was really enjoyable. I liked the new city they visit. \n There is a little romance for Ariel which was fun but just what you would expect a 13 year old to experience. \n There is plenty of room for more Farwalking and I hope to read more about Ariel and her friends!"}
{"text": "3.5 About Time Stars! \n Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Author \n As usual with Cardeno C. we get a sweet story about love filled with tons of heart. \n In Places in time its like a modern day 'a Christmas carol' without being actually christmas. \n Ethan finds himself freshly dumped again, which causes him to go to where he always goes when he needs comfort. On his way to his best friend \n Jude's house, he encounters a bit of an escape of reality with him being brought back in time to find out what he keeps missing but was glaringly obvious. \n Even though Ethan's a bit vain and full of \n himself he didn't realize that he's always had love. It just wasn't the kind he thought he would have, but quickly realizes that it's the kind of love that he deeply needs. \n Jude has always loved Ethan but never knew how do truly show him, when it seemed Ethan only wanted to be friends. So when he's finally given the gift of something he's always wanted, at first he's a bit skeptical but once he dives in, he goes all the way in. \n This was such a cute friends to lovers / straight to gay story.

{"text": "Facebook.com/TheBooknatics \n http://thebooknatic.wordpress.com/ \n ^my blogs \n --Advanced Copy-- \n Take a dash of Shakespeare, pour in a teaspoon of fantasy, and add a gallon of comedy, put it on the fryer and there you have it, a sizzling and joyous novel of adventure and fantasy! \n This was one of those books I couldn't put down once, the constant bickering between the trolls, the ludicrous battle plans, and one very confused elf. I got wrapped up in the outrageous troll scenes, twisted plots, running my imagination wild! All your favorite Shakespeare characters are portrayed as Dwarves, Elves, Trolls, in this witty, comical, and adventurous tale of a whole other world called Gundarland. I think this could well be another great Shakespeare-tragedy spoof. \n I love how the author takes famous quotes and turn them slightly to another meaning, for example, Hamlet and the, \"To bee, or not to bee,\" in regards of his beekeeping business that he is trying to pursue and establish, even though in spite of his mothers and the new king's wishes. Hamlet is to revenge his father's death while Othello has been set up by the grand Godmother. This is one you will have to read for yourself with no spoils! \n I will most definitely be recommending this book to everyone I know, and especially the people I game with online who are very much into Lord of the Rings, Everquest 2, and World of Warcraft. Mostly because this is how I envisioned the book. It made the book an even more fun read imagining that the characters were people I have gamed with over the years who played as these certain races."}

{"text": "So, I gather from the overall ratings that most other people liked this book. I didn't. It usually takes me one night to read a book. I had to spread the reading of this one out over five nights because it was too torturous to do in one sitting. I certainly haven't read the four preceding books in the series, and after this one - I won't be. \n It was character soup with too much talk about other characters I'd never even heard of. There were tracts of dialogue that left me wondering who the heck was actually speaking - and after rereading those sections three or four times, I gave up and moved on - still in the dark. For me, there wasn't sufficient focus on the development of the emotional connection between the hero and heroine; and there was no explanation at all as to how Acheron actually saved the day at the end. Had the story been better, I might have been curious about Acheron - curious enough to try another book in the series, but I was too dissatisfied to feel curious. \n My biggest regret is that I bought this book. I'm one of those people who like to help fiction authors by buying their book rather than borrowing it from a library. I use libraries as research centres - a place where I can go and use their reference materials for research. My local library has several books by this author, one of them titled Acheron. They're always sitting on the shelf - every time I go to the library. Obviously not moving. I can understand why. And I won't be touching them. Out of curiosity, I browsed their fiction shelves this morning to see if they had books by other authors I like - they do, but not on their shelves. When I enquired at the lending services counter, I was told that I would need to reserve those titles because they always turn around and head right out the doors again as soon as they are returned by a borrower. It made me feel much better - knowing that I wasn't alone in my reaction to this author's work."}

{"text": "Hmm 3 stars. This book started off pretty good. Sadly, it had to go down that certain path surprise! the guy is an extremely irresistible hundred of years old vampire who is anti-social (for the greater good of course)and is immediately, mysteriously drawn to the main character, who then turns into a stuttering, constantly horny and blushing fool whenever she is around him. *sigh* And even if he's dangerous and warns her away she is still attracted to him and blah blah blah love, complication, breakup and make up repeat.

{"text": "Aldric is a former soldier. His Alliance compatriots destroyed the Earth with nuclear weaponry and then departed to spaceships to wait while the radioactivity dissipates. Left behind to wait out the recovery--tantamount to a death sentence--are millions of people who didn't make the cut. Orphans, Anarchist soldiers, the old, infirm, infertile...and people like Aldric. Because he's fertile but unlikely to procreate--being a homosexual. \n Aldric has roamed the land for five years now. He enters a populated area and encounters Daniel, a historian. It's Daniel's mission to record the memories of Earth's forgotten to upload it for the colonists to view when they return in a century. He's also a target of the Forest Boys--marauders who will kill to obtain what supplies the desire. \n Daniel recognizes Aldric's strength and hires him to be a bodyguard, which is great--except Aldric strives to keep his past secret, and it's hard to do when he's in close quarters. See, Aldric's got some replacement parts courtesy of the military following a mortar attack. Daniel discovers this after Aldric is injured saving him from an ambush. Oddly, Daniel isn't repulsed, and doesn't send Aldric away. \n In fact, things seem to get good between them, on account of Daniel also being into men. This is short-lived however. And Aldric's back on the road. At least, until Daniel's ex attacks. \n This story is both somber and uplifting. Throughout all, there is this pervasive inevitability of death. People know they aren't going to survive, yet they attempt to live the best they can. This fatalistic approach allows for people to not only do heinous things (the Forest Boys) it also allows for people strive for better, and to build lasting bonds (Aldric and Daniel). I really enjoyed the story and felt the world building was excellent. The complex relationship between Aldric and Daniel felt so real. I wanted very much for them to find some peace in their desolate world, and that hope was met. \n This novella is a prequel to a two book series, but stands alone quite nicely.

{"text": "There might be spoilers here. Perhaps it is because I have just discovered Katie's dragon books and so all of the characters are very real in my mind, this was exactly the way I expected Kosta to behave when he finally discovered his mate. The dragon men have more pride than they need and it's delightful when the run head long into their mates who have a unique way of balancing them out. Kosta was \"broken\" in a way even before Aoife finds him; his pride was at least. He feels the need to constantly remind Aoife that he doesn't have a mate but then his actions tell a different story. I can hardly wait for the next installment to see how the relationship spins and twists. Speaking of twists only Katie could reinvent a beloved character and still make him one you love instantly. Jim is the very best of demons and I'm certain I'm not the only one who would love to have a demon dog just like him.

The action is even better in this book, and Gregor comes into his own. Collins has written created a sympathetic boy who is a do-gooder but not a goody-two-shoes. \n I really appreciate, too, Gregor's family. Although the Underland world is rich and fantastic, the real world of a lower class family struggling to make ends meet is realistic and relatable. \n And I've got to add something that I forgot to mention in my GTO review: because of this series, I've never before hated cockroaches less than I do now.

I honestly don't really remember what the main character looks like because those aspects in the book were so brief. The second half of the book was better but the first half was a bit slow. The fact that this book is so popular right now and Red Rising isn't as popular amazes me. I feel that maybe it's more popular because it's a female character which I understand. I personally tend to read female points of view more then male. But Red Rising is totally worth reading. Anyway, Red Queen was a not my favorite book but I'll probably read the next book just to see how it turns out."}

{"text": "My second book from Ajvaz was even more complex than the first one. While Tyrkysovy orel (Turquoise Eagle) was \"just\" a story inside a story inside a story... on 160 pages, Prazdne ulice (Empty Streets) are incredibly many serial as well as parallel stories, this time on 530 pages. The imagination of Ajvaz is amazing and I loved to read all the stories, no matter how much they were important for the main plot. The only thing I missed was any difference in style among all the stories told by so many different characters. I admit that this my demand could be caused by my recent reading of David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas where every story is in completely different genre and style. This is however what I've lacked in Prazdne ulice and why I don't rate it better. \n PS: I put it into fantasy category but it's actually more magic realism."}
{"text": "The Summoning can be viewed in one of two ways, as the author intended it, and as something else. It is intended to read as the coming of age story of an adolescent necromancer, in a decidedly non-magic world, full of mystery and intrigue. It can also be viewed as the teenage struggle to accept mental illness. Possible triggers for dissociative identity disorder and other illnesses present. Kelley Armstrong spins a brilliant yarn either way you choose to take it."}
{"text": "Miriam Black is a most unusual heroine. Like a gypsy, she drifts from town to town. And she is afflicted with a gypsy sort of a curse. If Miriam touches a person, she knows how and when (but not where) they will die. An early unfortunate experience has convinced our heroine that she is unable to change a person's fate. So, she follows people that she knows will die shortly and relieves them of their excess cash and other possessions. It's pretty much how she supports herself. That is, until the fateful day when good samaritan Louis Darling picks Miriam up while she is hitchhiking. She finds that she genuinely likes this large, gentle truck driver. But when their hands brush, Miriam receives a terrible vision. Louis is murdered with her name on his lips. At first, Miriam tries to avoid Louis in the hopes that she can avert his future. But that nasty bitch fate keeps throwing them back together. And now Miriam has some bad baggage. A con artist, Ashley, has solved the mystery of why she keeps showing up around dead bodies and he wants in on the action. Miriam needs to shake Ashley and save Louis. And it turns out that, thanks to Ashley, Miriam's life is now in danger too. This is a good fast read that I devoured in one sitting."}

I love the idea of 'mostly' and how the author reiterated this throughout the book- things were 'mostly' true, people were 'mostly' good. \n Unfortunately, this book was only 'mostly' okay."}
{"text": "I love this series, but this installment is a bit weaker to me, personally. \n Part of it is Eustace and Jill. While Eustace experiences tremendous growth during his first adventure in Narnia, he wasn't a favorite and without the Pevensie's to support him, he is flat. Lewis tried to do more with Jill, but her character still seems stilted and it is unclear HOW Lewis envisions her maturation. In the end, I miss the lovely Pevensie's, clearly drawn, dearly remembered, fondly embraced. \n Secondly, the setting of the Underworld is dreary. Sure, it's fantasy and the witch's world is to be undesirable. But Lewis' treatment here is heavy handed. It lacks the simple, mysterious poetry of \"always winter and never Christmas\" so much so that the claim that Narnian's explore the underworld in future times seems abrupt, strange and incongruous. \n Aslan makes several appearances, and the resolution of Eustance and Jill's problem is simply and somewhat cleverly done. The adorable MarshWiggle, Puddleglum and the Owl, Glimfeather are strong Narnian characters, full of unique personality, otherworldly gifts, and adventurous spirit. The plotting of the adventure itself is engaging (though somehow more predictable than other titles in the series), and this isn't a \"bad\" book, it's simply not as brilliant as some of the others. Additionally, love of Narnia compels true citizens to discover all her stories - even medals of silver found among medals of gold."}

{"text": "This is the first book in a cozy paranormal mystery series and the author has done everything right! The lead character is appealing with a secret past, the manor house has a quirky ghost for a landlady and the shifter and vampire roomies provide comic relief. The small town setting is filled well described with interesting secondary characters. And then the murder happens and the pace picks up while you and the amateur sleuth-who also happens to be a witch- try to figure out whodunit and why. This is an enjoyable read with magic nicely woven around the mystery's twists and turns. The author kindly provides a free prequel with the heroine's backstory on her website, which I found equally satisfying so I just bought Book 2 and can't wait to read it!"}
{"text": "Clever idea and beautiful writing. The author's characters are fanciful and likable, but in two areas doesn't suit my personal taste -- sometimes her dialogue flow is interrupted with too much description or internal musing (meaning on occasion when someone answers a question, I've forgot what it was in the first place)... and it's a bit too crassly sexual for my taste, in ways I'd rather not mention. So much so, in fact, that I won't read the rest of the books."}

{"text": "Ah such a fun read. I bought this on impulse, read it on impulse, and devoured it. This novel could be extremely boring, but Andy Weir infuses it with terrific humor, suspense, and variety that it keeps the repetitiveness at bay. It could just be \"here's a challenge, it's overcome, here's another challenge, it's overcome.\" But that stakes keep raising as the accidents escalate. Personally, I feel like it might be a bit more dull on a reread (maybe warranting a 4.5 star rating instead). It does fall victim to some survival narrative tropes and is not as concerned with the themes below the surface (see Life of Pi), but this novel is surprisingly profound. Amidst all the excitement and danger, moments of loneliness, bravery, and supportiveness shine through. It can be pretty emotional for a story whose chief concern is suspense. It just makes the journey all the more worthwhile."}

{"text": "Ghost Talkers by Mary Robinette Kowal \n Ginger is a medium working in the top-secret Spirit Corps during WWI. Ghost Talkers is a blend of historical fiction, paranormal, and alternate history. The spirit corps has used magic--which is real but takes a paranormal bend--to bind soldiers' ID tags so that they report in after death and act as Ally spies. This means the Spirit Corps has allowed the Allies to gain an important advantage in WWI. \n I've not read Kowal before, but she blends historical fiction with light paranormal elements to create a unique story. The main characters--Helen, Ginger, and Ben--have a lot of charm, which helps, but the real star is the tone of this novel. If you're a historical fiction fan, you'll probably love this book. I loved this book. It had everything good about historical fiction combined neatly with unique paranormal plot elements. It's rather light on fantasy elements (sans ghosts), but Ginger's powers as a medium are used deftly and often enough that they don't feel forced or like an unnecessary side note. Magical realism can rub me the wrong way sometimes because it's often 'oh yeah, and magic', and it's super obvious when an author wants to be 'more literary' and not play up the fantasy elements of their work. This book never short-changes or apologizes for being fantasy, and the historical details are added flourishes. \n Oh, did I say I loved this? I did. \n It was obvious to me that, at some point, Ben was going to die. I thought that he and Ginger would go on a secret mission first, and then he'd die in the course of action. While that did happen, Ben's death happened way earlier in the story than I expected. If Ben's death would've been the first event in the novel, though, it wouldn't have worked well, either. Kowel tricks you with the slow build-up, which made me think Ben would live longer than he did. Instead, his death kicks off a murder mystery and spy mission. The only nitpick I have is that I thought the main, tantalizing question--who killed Ben and why--wraps up too soon. But it's a great pay-off, and I was totally tricked into THAT SPOILER I'M NOT MENTIONING HERE BECAUSE IT'S A REAL SPOILER. :) Suffice to say, the plot works to keep you guessing. \n There are plenty of twists and turns in this story, too. The initial mystery is who killed a British gunner. The ghost claimed it was a British officer--a spy. Ben tracks down this lead, and he's murdered. Then, the mystery transfer to the more personal 'who killed Ben', which creates plenty of tragic and beautiful moments of Ginger interacting with ghost Ben. If you like light romance (sweet romance), this is a book for you, too. I loved the relationship between Ben and Ginger, and Ben's slippage into ghostly insanity tugged at my heartstrings every scene. Ben doesn't pass on immediately, but he's emotionally falling apart, and Ginger has the man she loves but is inevitably going to loose him. It's subtly and sometimes beat-you-over-the-head tragic, but always amazing. \n Rating: 5 stars. Loved it. This book blends historical fiction and fantasy superbly."}

{"text": "Bentwhistle the Dragon, A Threat from the Past by Paul Cude is the first instalment in the Bentwhistle the Dragon Series. The first chapter opens in the middle of a chase in Egypt, with an unnamed woman, whom we learn is a dragon in human form. \n After that the reader gets long alternating chapters narrated in the third person for two characters: Flash and Peter. Other chapters include a number of prisoners, where the reader gets a different from view point from the characters. \n The chapters with Flash are action-packed, exciting and fly by. The same cannot be said for the chapters with Peter, which are mostly mundane and boring, not to mention very slow. Some of Peter's chapters also involved sports, which I were not enjoyable for me and felt could be cut out. Others might find them fun, but I thought they were too long and not needed. At some point, I thought one of the games was going to affect the dragons in the long run, but it just turned out the dragons in human form were too tired, so I felt it was wasting time (for me). \n \"It was something all of his years of training had never prepared him for...fear, deep down, genuine fear, with a capital F.\" \n \"He knew now that his life hung in the balance, dependent on whether he could choose exactly the right window of opportunity, show one even exist.\" \n There was a lot of unnecessary descriptions and scenes for me, again in the chapters with Peter in them. At some point, I got the impression that every writer wants to include everything they've thought of in the book, but some of it just extended the length of the novel, which is an already long one. At some point, I felt I wouldn't be able to finish the book but I wanted to get to the end, so it spurred me forward. However, there were some points where I started skimming and skipping bits just to finish. \n There were some parts that I felt were not logic, like in the beginning with the pyramid, and later with Flash having a dislocated shoulder but miraculously undressing. There was also a significant amount of repetition in some parts that I felt could be trimmed. \n The novel would have moved a lot faster if the chapters were shorter, especially since there were breaks within the same chapter to alternate scenes and character perspectives. \n One of the things I truly disliked about Bentwhistle the Dragon was how the narrator addressed the reader in some parts, like saying \"Something quite literally magical happened.\" And \"I don't mean no energy to run, jump or swim. I mean he simply wanted to give up.\" \n When emotions and events are repeated over the course of the novel, they are often repeated using the same description or terminology. There were also bits between brackets, like the author was explaining to the reader what was happening. I preferred if that were integrated in the text itself. These bits bothered me. \n The problem that kept nagging at me was that Peter Bentwhistle is too ordinary. There is nothing special about him that would promote him to hero, as opposed to Flash who is likeable, practical and brave, and who has all the qualities that make him a hero. \n \"Risk and thrill seeking were simple part of his nature, as much as a twenty-foot tail, brown shiny scales, and teeth that a crocodile would die for, were part of his body.\" \n On the other hands, I loved the Lavapool game. It reminded me of Quidditch from the Harry Potter series, only played by dragons. I would have preferred I was given an idea how it was played rather falling right into it and having to figure it out for myself. \n There were however many interesting images and similes. \n \"Richie, normally cooler than a cucumber in a Siberian fridge, flinched just a little uncomfortably in her seat.\" \n \"Huge icebergs the size of houses littered the landscape like popcorn on a cinema floor.\" \n I also couldn't find the threat from the past. I think the novel needed some tuning in terms of redundant parts, so as not to lose the reader, and in some cases not to bore the reader as well. \n Overall rating: It took me a long time to write this review because I felt the novel didn't meet my expectations when I finally finished it. On closer inspection of my notes and while rereading bits for the review, I think a fair overall rating would be: 2 stars. \n Note: I got a request from the author for an honest review. \n The book is free via Smashwords here: \n https://www.smashwords.com/books/view..."}
{"text": "I'm not sure how I felt about all these stories as stories, but I just love the way Elizabeth Hand writes. Her voice seems so restrained, but you can always sense all the passion hidden underneath. Still, this wasn't really the kind of collection I expected to find under the subtitle \"Strange Stories.\" I've read quite a few books with that subtitle, which always seems to be added as a warning by the publisher. (\"We told you these stories would be strange!\") Usually \"strange stories\" fit into the genres of horror or magic realism. Some of these stories seemed like the first, some seemed like the second, and some seemed like neither. (These latter ones are the stories that I suspect come directly from the author's own life history. Sometimes this made me a little uncomfortable.) \n My favorite story by far was \"The Least Trumps.\" This was the most magic realist of the stories, and unlike any others in the collection, it actually has a hopeful, even joyous, ending. My runner-up was \"Cleopatra Brimstone,\" a somewhat sardonic tale of an entomology student who travels to London and encounters some most unusual insects there. \n If you want to read beautiful writing and aren't afraid of a little bit of literary suffering, then this might be the collection for you. But if you're the kind of person who likes short stories wrapped up neatly with a bow, you should probably move along."}

It got a little sluggish for my taste and I really started to dislike Q and the rest of the characters, but I think maybe that was intentional, too. I'm on the hook for the 2nd book."}
{"text": "Full review on The Bookshelf Intruder \n I liked a lot of things about this book. It wasn't perfect, it had its flaws... but not enough to stop me from enjoying the book. \n Dangerous Reflections was a pleasant surprise. It was unexpectedly exciting. The first few chapters kept me on the edge of my seat as Alexis realizes that she has a special power. I'm a history enthusiast like Alexis so her trips back in time were really fun for me. The book was equal parts historical fiction and contemporary, with a little bit of sci-fi (time travel, but the book doesn't explain the dynamics of this), and in combinations like this, one genre usually overpowers the other. In this case, I'm glad that it didn't. Both parts of Alex's life were given enough space. \n Alexis (who has the same birthday as mine) is a good daughter and a good student -- someone who actually enjoys studying and learning. I love that Shay West came up with a protagonist who's not the usual angsty, rebel teenager because not every teenager is like that, right? \n But Alexis isn't perfect either. Her teenage hormones drives her to like Beau, this jock at school. Cute, has beautiful eyes, and plays baseball, and is a major jerk. So I couldn't understand why Alexis likes this guy. Yes, I'm judging. I can't help it. I hate guys (and girls) who think they can get away with everything just because they look good. So I was silently cheering her on during the few times that she stood up for herself. \n Speaking of standing up for herself, Dangerous Reflections also talked about bullying, and showcased a simple but effective way to fight bullies. \n I only have a bit of an issue with the ending. It was a cliff-hanger but some cliff-hangers are okay, right? I mean, they don't leave you hopelessly hanging. This book felt like that for me for a bit, because there were things that weren't resolved yet. I feel like it could have seemed more \"wrapped up\" than it was. Of course, now that I have a copy of the sequel, I have no worries because I can go on reading Alex's adventures. \n Dangerous Reflections is a great choice for readers who are looking for an exciting and somehow educational YA fantasy. It's a great read and I think YOU should check it out. \n Thanks to Pam Labbe of Booktrope Publishing for the free digital copy of Dangerous Reflections and Twisted Reflections."}

They had previously been in NYC, but a botched kidnapping/ransom attempt two dirty cops made on Michelle left both cops dead and our two vamps on the road for quieter nightlife. \n Aaron's been winning a ton of money playing poker--his telepathy has earned him High Roller status, and a serious enemy--gangster Demarco. This dude doesn't like to lose, and he REALLY wants to get a piece of Michelle--steal her away from Aaron by any means necessary. He enlists security chief Kramer in his quest to kidnap and enslave Michelle. \n Aaron and Michelle are oblivious to the gangster's plan. They work the nightlife, taking small bites of multiple victims a night so that they don't get anyone addicted to their venom. Until Aaron meets Anastasia. \n This lost soul just wants to be loved. And, Aaron wants to love her. He is still only a month out from his transition and can't get past his need for companionship. He takes Ana as a bloodslave, against Michelle's wishes and orders. \n Surprisingly, Aaron, Michelle and Ana make a secure threesome. In fact, Ana's quite the helper lining up victims for Aaron and Michelle's nightly feeds. Then, Kramer and Demarco attack. \n Their attempt to kill Aaron isn't as successful as they'd like.

Way more trouble than they expected. \n Let's just say that when Aaron and Michelle leave Las Vegas, it's with broken hearts, and a bloody trail of dead gangsters. Oh, and a shadow. Yep. It seems Kramer had hired a PI to find out what happened to Demarco. Mike Jamison is hot on their trail with his own agenda. \n It's a steamy sexy adventure.

{"text": "Ala last time, I'll talk about my (spoiler) least favorite book first. Into the Green is classical Charles de Lint high fantasy. If you like Eyes Like Leaves, Into the Green is a similar (if slightly inferior) book. Angharad is Summerborn, and the story begins in tragedy when her tinker family (including father, mentor, and husband) all die of the plague. Angharad is the sole survivor, and the fae folk gave her a magic harp, which she names after her dead husband.Angharad is a thrice magical person: tinker, harper, witch. There are several lovely yet unconnected vignettes of Angharad traveling around the country finding and recruiting other Summerborn. The story picks up about half-way through when a the glascow, a box that releases wizard magic that kills the green, is brought to what is effectively fantasy world Dublin, where rich lords take witch fingers for their powers. The story fell apart for me here because two side characters, Tom and Lammond, steal the story completely from Angharad. This happens sometimes with de Lint--the side characters can (and do) end up with the more compelling story lines, which can sap the story of its strength. That's what happens in this book, which deflated the ending for me. Lammond was an especially unnecessary character, and I never quite got how he fit into everything. And no, not logically fit, but he didn't seem to be part of this story in the way the other characters did. Also, Tom's story is tragic, and I wish more of the story would've been Tom and Angharad working together and helping mend each other's lives. Alas, not quite what this story was."}

{"text": "First off, when a book is suggested to be like Game of Thrones I automatically think that everyone is going to die but I don't know why they related it to Game of Thrones. Just a side note. The first third of The Witch Hunter seemed well laid out and at a steady pace but after a while of reading everything sped up, and I almost feel that there were a lot of ideas thrown in the second half of the book so in other words the second half seemed quite sped up. I can't deny that this book kept my interest and reminded me of the movie Hansel and Gretel the Witch Hunters and Throne of Glass. The writing style reminded me of high school which was a disappointment but it didn't lack action which was a plus. I honestly wish that the book was more geared and written for older young adult but that's my own opinion. Overall, the book was alright and I can't deny that I'm interested in seeing what happens in the next book."}

Jes was a Fives contender until she met Lord Gargaron (or as I like to call him Lord G) who basically forces her to run the races for him or else bad things will happen to her mother and the rest of her family. Which they did, but Jes was able to rescue them. And then there was some twisted plot to put someone else on the throne?"}
{"text": "I really hate to be critical, but in this case I just can't help it. That ending was absurd and awful and infuriating. \n I can accept cliffhangers, but this goes beyond cliffhanger. For a good cliffhanger, I need to feel some hope, or satisfaction or resolution. \n I would have sworn I was missing pages or something. \n The relationship developments between Daemon and Katy did make me happy overall. Getting to know Dawson was also enjoyable. \n Katy's choice to not tell Daemon about Blake also ticked me off, because it undermined their new, trusting, mature relationship. \n Several consistency problems also really annoyed me. Daemon put the opal on a necklace, but then it was in her pocket, then it was around her neck. This was a key detail, and it didn't flow consistently. \n Also, the black sweats she borrowed from Daemon were destroyed, but then she wore them again for the second attempt."}

{"text": "The Witch's Boy by Kelly Barnhill. Published September 16, 2014 by Algonquin Young Readers. 5 Stars. I got this ebook from the library. Engaging from the very start. Brilliantly written about a couple of teens (one a twin) and their soulful and magical relationships with the earth, the forest, the stones, their dreams of the sea, and even death. An involved plot that is deeply simple at its core--how do the intentions and choices people make about love affect the future--theirs and everyone else's? An intriguing and fun YA read. Highly recommend!"}
{"text": "Written in a style that is very similar to Lemony Snicket, The Goblin's Puzzle tells the tale of a slave with no name who has been inadvertently finds himself in a bit of a mess. The young slave has always been a good slave, but now he is faced with the difficult task of having to decide what to do after the son of his master is brutally murdered - a murder which could be pinned on the young slave. \n While deciding what to do with his life, the young slave meets a tricky goblin. The goblin may hold the answers to who the young slave boy is and he even hints that the young slave may have a destiny far greater than he could ever imagine. \n In addition to the tale of the young slave boy and the goblin, The Goblin's Puzzle also follows the story of a young village girl who is faced with a case of mistaken identity and Princess Alice who is the target of a potential kidnapping plot. Somehow the two girls' story intertwines with the young slave boy's story and it makes for an adventurous fantasy novel. \n The Goblin's Puzzle: Being the Adventures of a Boy with No Name and Two Girls Called Alice is a fun, witty children's adventure fantasy novel that will certainly appeal to the older, more mature audience (the adults who have a heart of a child). It isn't laugh out loud funny, but there is a slight humor to the novel that makes it exciting and something that adults will certainly enjoy. \n While the story has a fairly run-of-the-mill fantasy plot, it is the way it is told that makes it fun and exciting. Each and every character is developed, which is amazing because the novel isn't really that long. Readers are given a sense that they have known the characters for a while and are extremely familiar to them. \n There are some twists and turns and puzzle-like themes throughout the novel, but all play a role in the plot. They aren't thrown out there to make the book more confusing or 'fun'. It fits in nicely with the flow of the novel. \n That being said there are some aspects of Goblin's Puzzle that should be noted. First, the murder of the master's son. It was a bit graphic, which could be difficult for younger readers who may be sensitive to such things. The book is middle grade and while death/murder isn't anything new, the description of the murder was fairly detailed which might be unexpected to some readers. \n The second aspect that should be noted is the focus on politics and religion. These aspects don't play a huge role in the story, but the book spends a lot of time on them. A younger reader or someone looking for action and adventure will find this information tedious and boring. On the other hand, the older reader will certainly appreciate the hat tip and some of the side remarks about religion and politics. \n The focus on politics and religion isn't bad, but it does slow the story down a bit. It is information that the adult audience would like, but that I'm not 100% certain the younger target audience would really even care about. \n Overall, Goblin's Puzzle was a fun, quick middle grade novel that has solid writing and is stand alone! There are some aspects that should be considered if you are considering it for a younger middle grade audience, but I think older MG audiences and adults will certainly like the story, especially if you are craving something that is a little more than your average 'fluff' fantasy quest novel."}
{"text": "I read this via a veersion emailed to me from Shut Up & Read. I really liked the concept of the book, I thought the storyline had a lot of potential. \n I'm not sure if it was just me but I didn't really feel any sympathy to the characters - there seemed to be no character building, no history of the character and their emotional intelligence and this made their reactions to events a lottery. \n I would have loved to have found out why Six had been thrown out of heaven and why she wanted to leave. To me the hell created in the book seemed pretty much ok and when compared with the world that Six experiences - of human and demon violence, I'm wondering why she's thinking she wants to stay on earth at all - but that might be the point of the story. \n Why for example does she feel she can trust some people and not others - we're told that there was a viewing room but why was this used? Did she have acquaintances in hell other than Alden? If not, then why not? Why was it so easy for her to escape hell? The revelations at the end of the book begin to answer these questions but I wonder if some sort of rivalary could have been set nearer the beginning. \n The drawings are amazing and a nice surprise in the book. As I said, I really love the concept and will definitely read the rest of the series to find out what happens as it is very intriguing. I feel bad giving it two stars as I mean two and a half really but I just like my character building slightly more robust."}
{"text": "Well. I'm pretty stunned.Of all the hundreds of reviews of this book everyone gives it a 4 or a 5. I must be missing something pretty major here. \n I could say that maybe this trio of paranormal romance wasn't my thing. That said, I do adore paranormal romance. What I don't adore is sloppy writing and even though these were short stories, that is what came across. Two of the stories involved women being kidnapped and then throwing their clothes off for their respective kidnappers. the second story I wasn't sure what the point of was at all. I would have given it a 0/5 if possible save for the fact that the final story actually was bordering on vaguely interesting. \n The women in this story are all anti-feminists. What I like about the paranormal romance genre on the whole is that most of the leading ladies kick ass, they aren't victims. But in two of the stories, even they they claim not to be these girls are victims. Who like standing around in their bras and knickers. And checking out how hot people are. \n At times I was actually cringing and must have looked a site on the train where I was reading the book where I actually shook my head in disbelief at some of the conversation. \n Not my thing at all. I only finished it because I had it down for my Summer spell challenge. \n I'm sure that there is a place for such stories in the world - as the average rating of this book shows - but I must live in a totally different galaxy as it didn't speak to me at all. Sorry."}

{"text": "Anche se la storia complessiva e piuttosto tradizionale, poiche presenta tutti gli elementi tipici della fiaba, le autrici sono riuscite a spezzare quegli stessi schemi creando una trama originale raccontata in modo alquanto peculiare. Ogni capitolo infatti e scritto dal punto di vista di un personaggio diverso, a volte dalle protagoniste, altre dai malvagi della Corte delle Tenebre, raramente dalla Regina, una volta interviene persino il fruttivendolo. I capitoli sono scritti tutti in prima persona, tranne quelli riguardanti la Regina e altri pochi personaggi. Questa tecnica narrativa e originale, ma ammetto di aver fatto un po' di fatica ad entrare nelle pagine del libro e ad immedesimarmi nei diversi personaggi. Una volta preso il via il romanzo, mi e risultato piu facile comprendere i diversi ragionamenti, ma nonostante tutto ho faticato parecchio a inquadrare bene i personaggi di Serana e Meteora, che per tutta la durata del libro il lettore tende a scambiare dimenticando chi e l'una e chi l'altra. Questo secondo me perche le autrici avrebbero dovuto caratterizzarle di piu, dando sfumature del carattere diverse alle due protagoniste. \n Per quanto riguarda la storia in se, sinceramente non mi ha appassionata, se non nelle ultime cento pagine, ed e un vero peccato perche questo libro aveva tutte le potenzialita per essere un buon libro, ma purtroppo la lentezza della narrazione mi ha fatto perdere un po' fra le pagine. \n Ho trovato molto belli ed interessanti gli spunti di riflessione che sono stati offerti dalle autrici: l'indifferenza nei confronti della donna anziana, la conoscenza delle erbe e dei rimedi naturali per curare l'anima e il fisico, l'aggressivita linguistica con cui ci esprimiamo noi esseri umani, la redenzione, la fiducia... sono temi che vengono affrontati in tutto il romanzo con semplicita, ma che danno modo al lettore di fare ragionamenti piu profondi di quelli che ci sono alla superficie. \n E' una lettura leggera, insomma, adatta a chi desidera abbandonarsi tra le pagine di un libro non impegnativo e a chi vuole leggere una fiaba letta in chiave moderna."}
{"text": "Crosspost: mytokyoblues.wordpress.com \n Commentary I was beyond excited when I read the synopsis, it was unique, it had Hispanic protagonists and dealt the Aztecs and Mayans! The cover is absolutely gorgeous! The story is told in two perspectives, Lucas (Mulac) and Zara. Like I mentioned before, I was excited to read it, until I actually started reading it. I wasn't a fan of Luca's perspective, I found him to a be a tad too possessive over Zara. He reminded me of Edward Cullen. He's immortal and about 500ish years old, and he has been waiting for Zara since the prophecy has been told. He and his family are watchers. Every 52 years, sacrifices are chosen, but once he meets Zara, he cannot let her die. Lucas vows to protect her despite going against the Gods. Honestly, I wanted to skip his parts, and move on, but I didn't...ughs. On the other hand, Zara's perspective was better than Lucas, but not by a lot. I did feel that the book was dragged out a bit too much. I didn't like the relationship between both protagonists either. Zara would get too angry at him and he would smirk a lot. Also, I didn't like how Lucas kept calling Zara weak, and instead of Zara telling him otherwise, she also kept saying that she was weak herself. Luckily there was no love triangle in this book. I looked forward mostly to the actions scenes, but they were a tad too boring. I kept wanting to drop this book. I really thought it had an interesting concept, but it was too descriptive for me. Another problem that I had is that there will be more books in this series...it would have been better as a stand alone book rather than a series to be honest. I thought she was going to become an immortal like Lucas, but that didn't happen. The ending was a disappointing. It ends with a kiss on a New Years party. In addition, the book really felt dragged out longer than it should have. Will I read the next book in the series when it comes out? No. Do I recommend this book? Not really. \n Final Rating 2.5"}

Qhuinn knows this, but he is unwilling to accept that love--feeling mostly unworthy, but also harboring a desire to conform, in any small way that he can--particularly as his family has always hated him for being imperfect. \n In previous books this dynamic has been well fleshed out, but in Lover At Last, Qhuinn's story, we see a new vulnerability. His family is dead and he's on his own. A willingness to chase Blay to find a REAL connection now consumes Qhuinn, but that's not so easy for a few reasons. \n 1. Blay's dating Qhuinn's cousin Saxton \n 2. Blay's very hurt that Qhuinn has repeatedly spurned his affection. \n 3. Qhuinn's going to be a daddy--now that he knocked up one of the Chosen. \n Still, the attraction is fierce. And once Saxton steps aside, Blay allows himself to sample a bit of Qhuinn, never believing that Qhuinn is capable of a real relationship. \n Boy, was he wrong. \n And, man, I did love me this book. \n It's a full-on M/M romance with sex scenes as wet and brutal as a hurricane. And, yet, the tender moments are equally fulfilling and thoroughly captivating. I long ago fell in love with Qhuinn falling in love with Blay. To see them finally connect? Rapture."}

{"text": "Don't let my three-star rating fool you, this is a good vampire story. In fact if it came out before Twilight I think it might have given the genre real credibility and no one would've paid attention to Twilight. The vampire world is fleshed out well although sometimes slightly too complicated. I liked the main character Tana as the human on the run and Gabriel as the cold and beautiful vampire is also a very interesting character. After an exciting beginning, the book did slow down for me and it took a while to start caring about these and other characters. However once they get into Coldtown I was on board I read rapidly to the end. I wonder if there will be a sequel? There might as well be I think there's more story to tell. I feel like there was quite a bit of characters which the author introduces but just didn't have enough time or the story couldn't flesh them all out well enough. \n Overall a good addition to the YA catalog, particularly for the vampire lovers."}
{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n I have now completed my re-read of this series. \n I want this book to be so much better than it is. It's not as weak as The Dark Is Rising was, but it's not much better. Susan Cooper describes things and people and scenery endlessly, and continues to drop chunks of convenient exposition all over the place that haven't even been hinted at in the foregoing series, but there is minimal character development of the protagonists, and sometimes minimal interaction. \n It is almost as if Cooper suddenly realized she had too many characters in her primary cast and didn't know how to write scenes where they all contributed. in some places, she handles this by splitting them up, bringing Merriman into the story late, and sending Will and Bran on a quest to the Lost Land, separating them from the Drews for several chapters. \n While I liked the character Gwion, the Lost Land chapters bored me so much that I kept falling asleep. The dreamlike quality and endless descriptions of the place did not help. Do we really need a description of Bran every time Will looks at him? I get it. He's very pale. He has unusual eyes. I hadn't forgotten in the last 2 pages. All the descriptions are probably meant to build tension, but all they do is stall the forward momentum of the story. \n There were things I enjoyed. It was good to have the Drews back, especially Jane. It was nice to revisit Wales and some of the characters there. And everything having to do with John and Blodwyn Rowlands was great. But it wasn't enough to hold my interest in the story. \n There were several scenes that seemed only tangentially related to the main plot, including the first few chapters where Will is at home with his family. There is a scene where Will and his brothers rescue a young Asian boy from a racist attack, but it has no greater significance than for Cooper to say \"racism is bad and of the Dark,\" which felt a little uncomfortable, considering her use of a Roma character in Greenwitch, and the fact that the boy in this scene never appears again nor is he ever mentioned. \n I got very tired of things happening just because that's how it is due to some ancient law that is never adequately explained. I'm tired of characters just knowing what to do at the right time because the knowledge comes to them, without them having to be clever or resourceful or draw on past knowledge they have gained. I'm tired of new major plot elements being dropped into the middle of the story without any sort of buildup, previous mention, or foreshadowing. And I am really tired of Old Ones wiping people's memories all over the place \"for their own good\". Wasn't there supposed to be an important message of free will in here somewhere? How can people have free will if they are not permitted to benefit and grow from their knowledge and experience? So at the end of it all, 4 of the 6 primary characters will remember nothing of their adventures in these books, will learn nothing from their experiences, and any growth or character development they gained is permanently erased as if it never happened. Screw that. \n But I think the thing I disliked most was the way the climax and the ending were handled. All the characters are finally together in one place and its like Cooper has no clue what to do with them. It's easy to forget some of them are there for pages at a time, especially the Drews, who hardly do or say anything during the climax. None of the primary characters interact much with each other during this crucial scene, and we are only reminded of their presence when Will occasionally notices their facial expressions. It is very frustrating. \n I'm glad to be done with this series. I liked the idea of it. I liked some of the characters. I liked books 1, 3, and 4 (Greenwitch especially was very good, with a tightly paced plot). I liked the pagan/historical/legendary elements and how they were important parts of the world Cooper built. But I have seen the Epic Battle Between Light And Dark with child and adolescent heroes done so much better."}
{"text": "I didn't like this book at all!!!"}
{"text": "I was a bit unsure about this series after the first book was so slow it almost put me to sleep, yet here I am book 2 and still reading. Overall, I think this series is very slowly inching to become a better series but it's not quite there yet. \n Pros of this book: \n -It moves a lot faster than the first book. There are huge sections of dialogue and it just seemed parts of the book moved faster. \n -There is less traveling and more plot movement which moves the series forward. \n -New situations and less mental debte made this a better read than the first book. \n Cons of this book: \n -While it moved faster than the first book it still is so very slow. Three chapters outline a meal between main character and subcharcter. \n -The main chacter is still frustratingly wishy-washy. He wants to be this wonderful middle man that is SO smart, yet acts before he thinks and then complains that no one will follow. \n Overall, I enjoyed this book but the main character still annoys me beyond belief. He is supposed to be SO smart yet is probably the stupidest person in this book. He does things and then goes \"oh... yeah I didn't think of that\" or... \"Oh.. I didn't know what I wanted\". Which makes me the reader wonder if you were so smart, why didn't you think beyond your initial thought? \n So even though I complained I thought it was an okay book and would probably read the third just because it wasn't a terrible experience."}

{"text": "9th&up \n This ARC was obtained at BEA14, in exchange for an honest review. \n Westerfeld's newest blockbuster seamlessly weaves two alternating stories in an intricate dance that will have readers holding their breath for a happy ending for both protagonists. \n Darcy is a young woman on the brink, ready to break all the rules and embrace an independent life that fulfills all her dreams. The high school graduate moves away from her loving small town family and their expectations for college and a traditional career, and instead takes a chance on life in New York City as an almost-published author. With a world of \"firsts\" before her, Darcy takes on her first time living solo, her first girlfriend, her first time being taken seriously as an author, and more. \n Lizzy- our other protagonist- is Darcy's literary creation, and she is destined for an anything-but-average life as well. When Lizzy is caught in the middle of a terrorist attack, everyone is being killed around her and there is no one there to help. With no other options, she plays dead- a tactic that she is a little too good at, as she ends up falling into the Afterworld and discovering that she can navigate between the human world and the world of the dead. The Afterworld is no place for a novice, however, and even with the help of the attractive Yama (spirit guide and lord of the dead), she is bound to make mistakes and come across darkness and evil that threatens her hold on the world of the living. \n Despite the massive size of this book (just over 600 pages), this is a charming and fast paced novel that masterfully weaves the two storylines together and provides many insights into the world of publishing and writing. (Personally, I loved the shout-out to BEA, the Printz award and all the other insider comments). \n Note- Due to the swearing, and some of the dark elements of the crimes in Lizzy's story, I would recommend this for 9th grade and above. Sexual content is not an issue (Lizzy's romantic relationship does not progress far, and Darcy's romantic relationship is serious but sweet and not explicit)."}

{"text": "Feeling a bit let down after reading the first book in this series, I am enough of a paranormal romance junkie that I decided to give book two a try. \n Though still a 3 star rating in my opinion, this novel is an improvement on the first book- I formed a stronger connection with the main characters and got more involved in the plot. The back stories for both Kerry and Dante were well developed, their chemistry heated up the pages, and the plot hummed along nicely as well. \n Since I have yet again been seduced by the teaser for the next book in the series, it looks like more Amoveos are in my future."}
{"text": "See full review for Evertrue at: http://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.w... \n I'll admit that I didn't really like book 1, it took me ages to finish reading it. But after the ending, I had to read book 2, and it was so much better than the first one that I was really excited for book 3. There were so many options for Ashton to go in with Cole turning Nikki into an Everliving and taking her heart. She could have had Cole be a total dick and control Nikki's actions, force her to go down to the Everliving and fight the queen. She could have made Cole disappear completely. Like I said the possibilities were endless. \n So that's why I was completely disappointed with the direction that Ashton did take with book 3."}
{"text": "I wanted to give this four stars, but honestly it feels too similar in formula and characters to Archer's Ministry of Peculiar Occurrences (MPO) series. I will say that this series feels a bit lighter, less gothic than MPO and the magic that Archer is describing is intriguing, but it's even really discussed/explained until almost the end, and then the ending itself is quite abrupt. Such endings are typical of Archer, but this one even more so since not a single main plot point was resolved. \n I plan to read the next installment, but have hopes that this series will be able to better distinguish itself from Archer's previous works."}
{"text": "As usual with Pratchett, some of his jokes wear a little thin, but this has the bonus of involving both Susan and Death -- two of my favorite Discworld characters. When Music With Rocks In comes to Discworld, it disrupts everything! It's quite a rolicking adventure, complete with one line that had me laughing until I cried -- \"Thank you,\" said the grateful Death. And yes, there are lyrical gags, clever arm-twists of famous band names, and a good deal of sarcasm meant to go around. Still. Susan. Her discovery of who she is, her reintroduction to Binky (Death's horse), and her interaction with \"nonsensical things\" is terrific. Plus, it has flaming wheels rolling out of debris and a rather disastrous incident in which Death has a wee accident on a bicycle (not named as such). I loved it."}

She's sent a few ghosts packing, she's still dealing with the ghost - Jesse - who lives in her bedroom, and she is even somewhat popular. Her adjustment is just in time too, because her best friend from New York - Gina - is visiting for the week and she is so excited. Hanging out with her best friend by lying on the beach and soaking up some rays, while occasionally going to school? Sounds like a good time to Suze. But, of course, Suze isn't that lucky. While picking up some drinks at the local mart at one of the beaches, she sees something completely odd. Four teenagers dressed in formal wear trying to pinch a case of beer. Suze knows that there's no way the store owner is going to let them get away with that, so why are they even bothering? \n That's when she notices the truth. They're not alive. They're ghosts. They're the spirits of the four teens who died in a horrific car accident the other night. Should be a breeze, because she has handled worse cases, right? Wrong. It starts when Jesse mentions that the four spirits are angry and he's concerned for Suze's wellfare. Then when she actually sees the ghosts again their sending down a plaster Mardi Gras head onto a fellow classmate of hers. The classmate who was in the other car and walked away unscathed. Now, she knows that it's a matter of revenge...but who's? \n I've said it in my other reviews for this series, and I don't mind saying it again. I love these books a lot. And even though it's been over a decade since I first read them, they are still great."}
{"text": "This book pulled me in fast, and it'll probably pull you in too if you're enough like me that you're reading my book reviews -- that is, a fan, a geek, or at the very least some variety of nerd. It slows a little in the middle as we begin branching out to follow other, stranger characters, but it pulls together and starts rushing forward again soon enough. Every section is written in first person, but we follow a variety of people, some of them mercifully briefly when they narrate in heavy dialogue (it was saved from being awful by the sheer chutzpah of oh yes, he's going to take this to its horrifyingly logical conclusion, really and truly); many of the sections are preceded by mock-RPG character sheets (fear not any roll-the-numbers scenario with stats like \"wisdom: fortune cookie +8, experiential -2\" or \"shit points, give/take: +3000/0\"). All of the characters had a certain something that made them interesting and memorable, including the bad guys, but I was definitely with Hamza and his fanpair Yehat the whole way down, rejoicing to see characters so much like me leading in an adventure story -- which might seem odd on the face of it, as I'm neither Black, male, Canadian, underemployed, single, nor heterosexual, but was instead quite straightforward as it felt like Hamza and Yehat and I approached these identity points with the same attitudes and that is how the identification actually happened, even beyond the huge common point of fannish geekiness -- and also to see characters who are so close and yet so very far from me (these would be the Fanboys) get...well, I won't spoil it, but I think you know what I mean. \n This isn't a particularly easy book to put down and pick up, but once I settled down with it it wasn't a hard book, although I had to pause for contemplation of the sheer awesome occasionally. I won't give away the ending except to say that it was not what I expected but it was what I wanted. Oh, it absolutely was, in all sorts of fantastic ways."}

{"text": "10th&up. A different and really well-constructed work. \n Werlin starts her novel with interesting but not unbelievable themes. Lucy's life quickly goes from ordinary to mind-altering, when she is date raped at the junior prom and finds out that this act was no accident and is actually connected to her insane absent mother, an evil elphin lord and a curse involving three impossible tasks set out in a version of the folk song Scarsborough Fair that has been passed down through generations in Lucy's family. \n With the help of the loving parents who adopted her, and the slightly older boy next door who could become so much more, can a pregnant Lucy beat the curse and save herself and her soon-to-be-born daughter from the bleak future fortold in the ballad? \n The rape scene was nicely crafted- subtle, yet not trivialized, and the mentions of abortion, the right to choose, teenage marriage and marital sex are merely touched upon. They are fitting with the story and not at all explicit or preachy. \n I though it was a really unique and powerful book."}
{"text": "I wanted to like this more than I did. I struggled with the writing. The odd change of perspective, a couple of phrases used way too much and descriptions like \"I then went further into the city\" when the fact that he was in a city wasn't even established drove me nuts. The main character is pompous and arrogant if there was a gold medal for bragging, well, he would have won it for every country because his skills know no bounds. He wasn't hard hearted though and his sweet friends Willom and Simmons (forgive me if I misspelled them- I listened to the audio and never saw the names in print) helped me to stick with the story. I actually gave up on it twice before somebody convinced me to stick with it. I'm not sure if I'm really happy they did since I didn't love the book but I guess there are worse story lines out there.

{"text": "This may be a revelation to my Santa Claus who gifted me with it: I am not a certified fan of HP series. I could have been when it was initially released in 1997 or adapted for a movie in 2001. I could have been one of those fanatics burgeoned around the world mimicking covens of wizards , waving our replicas of magic wands while enchanting the magic spells we memorize by heart, ostentatiously displaying our black garbs riding our brooms, or puzzled by how we should use the other magical objects. But I never am! Perhaps I was mesmerized by my best friend 's bewitching addiction to it. Whenever she grumbled about it and shrieked in disappointment or excitement without any ideas of her idiosyncrasy, a sparkle of curiosity would linger in my mind. Whenever she was a spoiler since I was not interested in it at all, I would not brush off the idea that it could be a good read. I made it!!! I read book 1, 2, and 3 even their movie series. As a matter of fact, I just borrowed them from her given that I was almost so kleptomaniac to claim them as mine. Thereafter, I quit keeping up with all the series; my urge to be part of the covens of wizards in Hogwarts caved in. I let myself be part of the \"Muggle\", denied of the right to be wriggled under the Sorting Hat. \n When was released last year, I was one of those bookworms who pretended to be interested in it. I was, but I threw doubt on it ;I was aware of the fact that I was a \"Muggle \" . In fact, I even broke the news pell-mell to my friends on Facebook with my screenshot from as if I were such a certified HP fanatic. Well, I was still excited I could hardly contain myself. \n Since I could not afford its price, I accidentally searched its free pdf on VK, one of the largest European online social networking services based in Russia. \n The first questions that had bothered me before reading it were: \n Can I understand the whole story although I have not read nor watched all the series yet? \n Is it a sequel or prequel for the first Harry Potter series? \n How does it differ from novelization since it is a screenplay? \n Surprisingly speaking, I could totally relate to the whole story because I happened to read the first series and watch Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. I swear that from the beginning to the ending, I committed the scenes and acts to my memory. I can even recite it in a nutshell now if you ask me what the dickens this book is all about! But don't expect me to do so with a photographic memory. I was not born to be a precocious child. (laughs) I did so when I ate lunch with my friend who is also a big fan of HP. I could not believe my ears what I was telling him about. Voila! The most interesting is that even the magical objects namedropped are still fresh in my memory despite that I searched them on Google to beef up their imaginary pictures. Now, the question is : Would you still understand it if you have not read Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire yet? \n The first comment that had instilled in me when it was such a fever in the market was it was the prequel for the first Harry Potter series. I had been conditioned with this idea before I finally gave it a hand. The revelation? It is a big NAH! I was fooled! I was made believed! I was disappointed! I was spoon-fed! What a shame! As the story went deeper, the feeling was like knocking the living daylights out of my gullibility. So, I dreaded reading the next stories to happen. I worried that I might not be able to understand it since I have not read all the series yet. But good grief! Thanks graciousness! The Harry Potter and The Goblin of Fire was my savior! Now, the next question is: Which one is supposed to be better, it were a prequel or sequel? \n When The Harry Potter fanatics found out that the book turned out to be a screenplay, they miffed.They may have not been used to reading Harry Potter series in a screenplay. They may have thought that they would not enjoy it; novelizing a story has a kaleidoscope of literary elements. Well, count me in them! Nevertheless, it is not that bad. Reading it is so light! You could finish it for one day. Believe you me! Alas, I read it for a week because my job steals my valuable reading time. Now my verdict: It could be more exciting if it had been novelized. \n As far as I remember, I quit reading fantasy books when I started studying psychology. My major taught me that everything in the world happens for a logic . Then, I no longer believed in magic. For me then, fantasy could be contrary to the Natural Laws of the Universe. Rather, the only books I read were based on scientific and philosophical discussions. However, when I was tempted to read the first Harry Potter series, I slid back to my childhood , fascinated with all the mysteries in the universe. Such reaction must be the initial effect when anybody, regardless of age and religion, tends to get hooked on it. My co-teacher left behind The Harry Potter can bear witness to this ; recently, he has watched its movie series and now he is playing like a child imitating the wizards of the Hogwarts , casting a spell ,whatever comes to his mind, on whomever he meets by chance , just for fun! ^_^ \n Now I wish to read all the series in 2017.( crossing fingers) \n Thanks to my Santa Claus again!!! ^__^"}

But unlike what the website states, this camp isn't for teenage delinquents, it's for teenagers with unique abilities. Like being a vampire, witch, werewolf, fairy, or shape shifter. But even amongst the supernatural, Kylie is still labeled weird. She can see ghosts and her brain - which should show her unique signature - is shut off to the other supernaturals around her. But as Awake at Dawn begins, things are getting really strange when at a vampire ceremony, Kylie takes a sip of blood and likes it. \n The weirdness doesn't stop there when she's also being followed around by a wolf, her strength and hearing are heightened, her mood swings go over the top, and she has a huge growth spurt. The questions about what Kylie really is continue to grow in number and even she is confused and doesn't know where to find the answers. She decides to start with Daniel - her real dad - adoptive parents, hoping that maybe they can fill in the blanks. But even as she struggles with who she is, she also has to decide which boy she likes. Derek - the always there for her - fairy who can manipulate her emotions? Or Lucas - the mysterious guy from her past - wolf who left camp with his ex-hookup? Let the drama commence. \n Do you ever read bad fanfiction? But for some reason, despite how bad it is you can't stop reading it because you want to know how things end? That was me with Awake at Dawn and right now with the Shadow Falls series."}

{"text": "I'm so glad I stuck with this book. About fifty pages in, I was ready to give it up; Angie W., who recommended it and lent me her copy, felt I should stick with it.

But once Moon's case started (or, rather, once he was interested enough to start trying to solve it), that didn't much matter--in fact, it actually enhanced the overall odd feel of the book. I'm still unsure whether or not I understood the book in its entirety, and I'm still thinking about it. It's a fun, fantastical \"mystery\" full of oddball characters: a bearded lady, a time-traveling ugly man who may or may not have founded London, two assassins dressed like overgrown prep-school drop-outs, a human fly, and, of course, the titular side kick, the Somnambulist.

There isn't too much aliens/sci-fi and it really is only gleamed over. But I cannot WAIT to read more aliens in the next few books. \n Another element that I liked was the bit of history/take on history that was given. I think it fit nicely in the book and really added a nice element to it. \n If I could change anything I guess I would have put a few more aliens in the book. This first book was very heavy on the corporate conspiracy and light on the aliens but do not fear there WILL be aliens in other books. \n So if you are looking for shape-shifting, cool teenagers and a corporation that is trying to brainwash people this is the book for you!"}

Fairies used to enslave humans and kill them, but after a war they signed a treaty to live in peace and separate from each other. With her cripple father and her two ingrate sisters, she hunts everyday, desperate to find some food to feed them in the winter. One day she spots a wolf about to a deer, and she sensing it may be fae, she decides to kill it with her iron wood arrow. She did it because she needed the deer and the wolf's skin for money, but she also hated the fairies for their cruelty and abuse of humans. \n A day later a giant beast appears at her door and demands to know who killed the wolf. Since it was a fae, he decides to spare, but she has to go to live with him for the rest of her life. She accepts to save her family. \n Once in his territory, she learns that Tamlin he is a High Fae, and High Lord of Spring, one of the seven areas of his land. She initially hates his kind, but eventually gets to know them and finds herself caring for Tamlin in a way she never imagined. She also starts to build a friendship with Lucian, who at first hated her. \n But there is something that the whole court is afraid of, something that is killing fae, making them sick, taking their powers, and that could soon expand to human lands. \n I loved this story. I didn't realize it was a retelling of beauty and the beast until almost the very end, when it hit me. But that made it even better, because it kept me guessing. \n I liked Feyre, she was a great main character. I liked Tamlin, considering he couldn't tell Feyre what was going on. Lucian was a nice character too. But I hated the sisters so much. Nessa at the end was ok, but the other one was the Hunger Games little sister stereotype and it was areally annoying. The father was also kind pointless. \n The ending of the book was dark but predictable. I liked that the story changed, that it didn't stay as a fairytale. And I loved Rhysand.

{"text": "In this contemporary YA paranormal romance Ariana and Logan Ragsdale are orphaned siblings who happen to have mind-control powers. Logan is 18 and Ariana is 16, both born on All Saints Day, two years apart. Their parents died in an house fire 8 years ago, and their aunt and uncle, who had been guardians, were killed in an auto wreck two years ago. After bouncing to a couple foster homes and finding those caregivers being strangely injured, Logan convinces the Illinois State Foster system to let them live alone... \n When we begin the story, Logan and Ariana are staying under the radar of the authorities. Ariana has a BFF, Becca, but they mostly keep to themselves--out of fear that any people close to them are targets for the tragedy that seems to follow them. \n Of course, they are teens, so it's impossible not to notice the two new students in their small high school. Ben is in Ariana's art class, and interested in dating her. Strangely, he is immune to Ariana's mind-control. Likewise, Logan meets Kira in Foods class. The attraction simmers, and yes, she can resist Logan's mind powers. \n Starting fledgeling relationships is foreign, but exciting. Still, they are wary due to the lack of effect of their powers on their potential beaux. Especially so when Kira begins to reveal more of her history to Logan. She's been 16--for a real long time...and most of that was spent in agony. Seducing Logan to her purpose will satisfy the requirements of her boss, but could mean the end of civilization. \n Not as though these kids didn't suspect foul play in the deaths of their caregivers, but who's really ready to accept celestial explanations? Surely not Logan. He thinks Kira's off her nut, and rightly so. A little physical demonstration promptly makes him a believer, however. \n And Ben? He's on the other side of this equation. He's anxious to get Ariana to join his team, even if doing so condemns Logan to a fiery fate. \n With new knowledge behind the sinister plot that isolated Ariana and Logan from anyone who could help them, they must choose who to trust. According to a prophesy, a war is coming between the Blessed and the Fallen, and the winner will be decided when Ariana, or Logan, chooses a side to assist. \n In either case, accepting their destinies means they will lose each other. Or, not. See, Ariana and Logan are determined to beat the Blessed and Fallen at their own games--and set themselves free of this cataclysmic prophesy. \n Not that they go about it right. Outsmarting beings that can read your mind is pretty tough, after all. Escape Plan A soon devolves into Survival Plan C.2 when one of their guides changes teams mid-game and the casualties are dear. \n It's a wild chase with pretty steady tension throughout as Ariana and Logan search for the answers that will divert their fate. The end is tied up, but leaves room for a sequel. It's an innocent read and suitable for lovers of paranormal YA fiction."}

Turns out it IS the story of two sisters, but not in the way I imagined, at all. Overall, I found it very weird. \n The beginning of the book had me very confused. Things are happening and you're not sure why - Ruby can get anyone to do anything she wants, Chloe finds a dead girl while swimming but the events directly before and after are a bit muddy, Chloe moves to live with her dad for several years and has no contact with Ruby though they were so close before. \n Then there is even more mystery when Chloe comes back - so so so many questionable things. Some things were properly eerie, but some just didn't make sense to me. I felt like I couldn't read fast enough to catch up to where my mind was supposed to be in the story. \n I did love Nova Ren Suma's writing. She flows the words together beautifully. The plot just really did not resonate with me. The cover is also very fitting, certainly more after you finish the book. \n There are many five star reviews of Imaginary Girls on Goodreads, so perhaps going into it with different expectations will help - it is definitely more psychological than contemporary. Many of the actions and scenes are spooky. It was just not a very good fit for me."}
{"text": "This is one of the worst books I've ever read. I feel swindled that I paid money for it. Then I read that it is going to be made into a film by the directors of Harry Potter. I'm beyond stunned. What did I miss? The characterisation made no sense - the main character changed personality from paragraph to paragraph as did the other characters. She went from uncertain to certain. Uncaring to caring. Worried about her body to not worrying about her body. \n There was a theme of women being oppressed and an indication that this was a bad thing yet in the very next breath the main character is lamenting that she is too overweight to fight or that she is not pretty enough. \n The book seems to be set in the future but it reads like it was set on the past. There is no explanation as to why we went from technology to a neo-medieval world with magic. The Library has Harry Potter books which was just cringeworthy. \n I actually wanted someone to succeed in killing the Queen of the Tearling. In fact, I'm rewriting the end of the book in my mind to ensure this happens. I could go on and on but I've already spent way too much time on this book."}
{"text": "'You really ought to read this book,' she said, and shewed it to me. \n I cast a discerning gaze upon it and said, 'Perhaps.' \n Taking it home to my sweet little house in the midst of the country, with thick rose bushes curling about it and robins occasioning to bathe in the little furrows of water created by the sinking paving stones about the front walk, I sat it upon a shelf and occasionally glanced upon it. Somewhat intimidated by the sheer size of it, for it could scarcely be called a 'quick read,' I did not cast my eye upon it greatly until thoughts of Faerie intruded upon my dreams. (Or rather, my television screen.) Eager that it might unearth some deeper secrets than the superficial treatment of the serie--err, dream, I delved into it readily. \n Great specters loomed in my mind and over my shoulders, visions of Faeie realms and their grim servants, of the presence of the Raven King and occasional whimsical thoughts as deep as the lay-pond, forming about me as surely as the great darkness enveloped Strange; I was lost, maddened, perplexed, caught up, torn asunder, forced to read until my eyes ached, with occasional outcries of \"No! Surely not!\" that disturbed the pretty kitty on her perch. Two days I thus labored, pausing only to eat cake and lament that any book should have quite so many words, before I reached the end. \n Whereupon I concluded that it was quite a lot charming, and a little bit dull in unforeseen places, that I should dearly have liked to see more of Faerie and its notorious 'gentleman' but was quite unprepared for the grotesque turn it took in the last fifty odd pages and that, oh dear, I now have nothing to read."}
{"text": "This book felt like one wild ride. I couldn't put it down because the book's pacing never let me take a breath. I loved it.

I'm not sure any kid over the age of 10 would find this book intresting. 100 pages into the book I was finding myself hoping that the children would be harmed just so that something would happen. \n The idea of the book was great but the writing just plain sucked. Every sentence started with \"Kendra .....\" \"Seth....\" \"He.....\" \"She.....\". When some action did come into the book it was over in two pages. \n The ending was the worst, with 60 pages to go I just had to groan. The ideas would stray so that you almost forgot what was going on. \n The characters in this book were all one sided. Girl who doesn't break rules, boy who does. Grandpa and Grandma kept saying, well we'll explain later. It felt as though it was written just to cash in on more books. Harry Potter I think not"}
{"text": "This book was intriguing and I loved the Russian Magic History aspect of the whole thing. It left us on one heck of a cliff hanger which is frustrating but awesome at the same time.

There are a lot of questions I still have so I want the second book, like now."}

This is the fantastic story of how Meg, her little brother, and their friend--with the help of three eccentric \"ladies\" go out getting Meg's father back. \n Identify at least 2 characteristics of this genre and subgenre and discuss how they appear in your book: \n This novel shows the characteristics of science fiction for the middle grades. It first deals with issues (in a futuristic way) that are important to middle school children today. This book speaks directly to the idea that who people are as individuals is important. Only Meg could save Charles Wallace. With all of her \"flaws\", she was still the one he loved, and it was this love she had that could destroy IT. Middle school kids are all trying to figure out who they are, and this book tells them that any form of what they are is not only okay, but is perfect. \n This novel also helps kids to develop their imagination. They have never experienced other worlds or a tesseract, but they can read about it and imagine it to be. They can imagine what Mrs. Whatsit looks like when she is no longer a person but instead a mythical-looking animal. And Aunt Beast's tentacles are something to imagine caressing you. \n In what ways and how well does the book as a whole serve its intended audience?: \n This novel does a wonderful job bringing middle school aged kids into an alternative world.

I literally squealed near the end *no spoilers allowed*) \n Basically, I was NEVER bored while reading this. It was action packed right from the beginning. The urban setting and world building behind the vampires versus the lesser society was intriguing. The love scenes were steamy. The dialogue was quick and great. \n What I didn't like about this book: \n Officially hooked."}

{"text": "Fallen was an interesting read. It wasn't riveting but it's one of those YA books you just have to read. I liked it very much, including the cover. The cover is just gorgeous. It's amazing. I'm in love with it. It's actually the first thing that prompted me into reading it in the first place. It suits the story line as well. \n The characters were okay. I did feel Luce was just another Mary-Sue. She doesn't have any real quirks that give her some real depth. Daniel was the same. Sure, Lauren Kate has described him perfectly, looks-wise, but I know nothing of his personality other than the really obvious characteristics. I felt the minor characters were really cool though- Arriane was easy to connect with, Gabbe was not very difficult to understand and Penn is that nice friend that everybody has. Cam was lovely; I was rooting for him throughout the novel even though I was 99.9% sure Luce was going to end up with Daniel . Those Mary-Sues always do. But I love betting for the underdog. \n One thing that annoyed me was the love triangle; it was completely unnecessary. If Luce and Daniel were meant to be true loves, and meant to be like what he said when he revealed that he was an angel, what's Cam there for? To add in spice and temptation? . Love triangles are popping up in every book I read lately with an alarming rate. Some work out fine and some not so much. \n Other than that, it was all great. I'm looking forward to reading the next book."}
{"text": "4.25 stars \n Really like the way Sabaa write the story. Each plots are the twists. All twists make me have intense passion to keep reading on it. And it's kind of torture to put down the book. I can also hear the sound of being brokenhearted while letting it go. \n The reason why I didn't rate in 5 is that there are some parts annoying me a little bit much. Just don't feel right while getting into those dialogues, words, and the characters' minds. So it's not that perfect as I first to think. \n However, as a dystopian novel, An Ember in the Ashes has a very unique and powerful storyline, making lots of unanticipated turns and surprise. Also, the characters remind us to figure out who we are and what we really want to be. Teach us how to be more formidable and unbreakable."}
{"text": "This review was written fro Joyfully Jay Reviews and can be accessed here: http://joyfullyjay.com/2016/04/review... \n 5 Stars! \n Colm Weathercliff lives in a world built on magic, superstition and fear. His mountainous village of Anneslea is no longer a safe haven, now that his father has died. The clerics will soon press him in to farming and marriage, although he has no inclination toward either. Colm has a \"knack\"--don't call it magic!--for locating fish, and has been a steady fisherman at his home lake since his childhood. Fearing for Colm's well-being now that his charismatic father has passed, his stepmother encourages Colm to take his father's ashes to the ocean for burial. She has an aunt in the capital city of Caithmor who will take Colm in, but the trip is long and Colm has little resources. \n He joins a trader's caravan, with the agreement that he gather fish for Fergus, the head trader, each night, a small issue for a man of Colm's nature. He and Fergus bond, sharing the adventure and a few secrets, and a month later Colm is finally in Caithmor. There he meets his stepmother's relations, Aunt Megg and cousin Nichol, who take him in readily. They know all of Colm's talent from years of family correspondence, and help him to find a job as a fisher's mate. Unfortunately the fisher is a drunk, and his big mouth and bigger catches raise the ire of the other fishermen. They alert the clergy, the only legal practitioners of magic. Colm is subjected to torturous questioning and his livelihood ruined, but he's not without resources. He works in Megg's inn and enjoys spending time with Nichol. Nichol is a young man, like Colm, who finds attraction to other men. He is besotted with his childhood friend, and they are a tight pair until Colm's disgrace causes a rift. Soon Nichol is on the outs, and Colm must help him get over his heartache. And the love is strong between them. I liked how they had been friends first and became close as the weeks and months wore on. \n It looks as if life is picking up for both Colm and Nichol when the unthinkable happens and Colm is transfigured. This isn't the worst part, though. Nope. Nichol is gravely injured, Colm is distraught and bereft, and then kidnapped and tortured, and well, it does better. A lot better, actually. But first, Nichol and Colm must endure a big upheaval in their lives, and risk everything to escape and find safe harbor. \n I really loved how this book tied all the plot lines tight. Characters that seemed inconsequential became indispensible. There is actually more to the plot than I've outlined, but I can't reveal more of the tapestry without taking all the joy from it. This is a fantasy and adventure with a romance that grows naturally. I was so intrigued throughout, because the world building is excellent. The elements of magic are considerable, with selkies and mer and curses and priestly charms. I think everyone will know the secret of Colm's magic from the blurb, but the reveal is so different from my expectations that I was completely blindsided by the next several plot turns. I found the juxtaposition of religion and magic to be unique, with the priests and royalty full practitioners of magic, while even innate magic was forbidden to the regular folk. \n The end is squarely in the HEA category, but it's a hard won ending. Like Colm, readers will be on the edge of despair until the last chapter, or two. I was captivated, and pleased both with the story and it's pacing, especially given the length. The book is nearly 500 pages, and I honestly didn't feel as if any of them were wasted. If you like fantasy, magic, and are willing to suffer the amazing turns of Colm's fortune, I really think you'll like this one. \n I also suspect there might be another book in this world, as there were a few characters I could \"see\" getting their own stories--quotes here because one of them is an intriguing blind soothsayer."}

It became more fantastical than the first as well."}
{"text": "An absolutely astonishing modern urban fantasy that blows away what most American authors are doing at the moment. While it helps to be passingly familiar with what's going on in modern Russia, and you'll miss some of the meta-commentary on their modern society, there's plenty of romance, action, and adventure in the book without being overly steeped in Russian politics. \n At the end of the day it's about human beings and emotion, and about the grey areas in the fight between good and evil, and how good can do evil and evil can do good, with the exception being that those who do evil usually don't care about the morality of their actions. \n Hauntingly beautiful in places and razor smart in others, it's at times a meditation on the forces that are beyond our understanding in society as well as an entertaining romp. Highly recommended."}
{"text": "The second book of the Covenant series began with a spirited jog and quickly escalated to a wild sprint. It is so full of action and emotions,but not overly dramatic. I didn't find any moments lagging to flesh out storyline or lacking in content or forward motion. \n I have to admit that I found my heart breaking over and over again for Alex and she came through it all--what a strong, and extremely flawed, character. I love that she is never perfect, but always finds her way through to the end."}
{"text": "This was my second time reading Harry Potter and The Order Of The Phoenix (first time in English), and I'm very surprised at how much I forgot. Not just details, but complete scenes. It's safe to say that the parts I did remember, were not coincidentally the parts that also appear in the movie. But me forgetting so much, made this book that much more fun to read. Before rereading The Order of the Phoenix, I thought The Goblet of Fire (HP #4) was my favorite Harry Potter book, but now, immediately after reading The Order of the Phoenix, I feel like it's a tie between these two. I might just need to give it some more thinking. \n This is the first book in which the story gets a lot darker. Harry is no longer the famous Boy-Who-Lived, but rather the infamous Boy-Who-Lied. After the Triwizard Tournament he confessed to the world that Lord Voldemort had returned and even though Dumbledore stands by Harry, not a lot of wizards seem to believe him. Minister of Magic Fudge seems determined in bringing discredit to both Harry as headmaster Albus Dumbledore. Fudge sends Secretary Umbridge of the Ministry of Magic to Hogwarts to make sure the School for Witchcraft and Wizardry is to his standards: the students must be indoctrinated that Voldemort has not returned. Umbridge takes her job very seriously and tries to gain more and more power over the school. \n On the other hand, a group of people have assembled in secret to prepare for the fight against Voldemort: the Order of the Phoenix. The Order contains members like Sirius Black, Mad-Eye Moody, Remus Lupin, Tonks and Mr. And Mrs. Weasley. \n What I really loved about this book were all the revenge scenes, especially regarding Umbridge and Fudge. Umbridge turns out to be an extremely malicious and annoying person and later-on in the book, she definitely needs to pay for that. The scene in which the Weasley-brothers Fred and George fly out while creating a huge swamp in the castle and setting off dragon-like firework, is genius. Even more genius, is the awesomeness of all the teachers (especially McGonagoll) while deliberately contradicting Umbridge even though she has the power. And most genius of all: Dumbledore. The coolness he has while he very obvious is more powerful than anyone, is very satisfactory. \n The end was heartbreaking, of course, yet I really loved it. It just seemed fitting. I have loads of quotes from this book in my updates regarding this book, so if your curious, definitely check them out."}

{"text": "Blade Dance is the fourth book in the Cold Iron Series by DL McDermott. I have been reading the series right along and thoroughly enjoy the storylines. Blade Dance focuses on Finn MacUmhaill, leader of the Fianna, and Ann Phillips, schoolteacher. Blade Dance takes a different spin, and instead on focusing on Fae sorcerer Miach MacCecht's family and associates, the storyline shifts to the other local Fae leader, Finn. \n Finn, vicious until the end, has been faced with many issues and run-ins with the MacCecht's, especially where his son Garret is concerned. \n Ann, determined to save a child in her class, isn't afraid to confront the cruel Finn MacUmhaill. \n Finn set on wooing Ann, will not let anything get in his way, even the Prince Consort and keeping trying to keep the walls in place to prevent the Fae Queen and her court from returning. \n The characters are well developed with their strengths and weaknesses; we get to see characters from the previous stories as well. Blade Dance is steady-paced and an easy read with a good blend of paranormal romance and suspense. Looking forward to reading more of the Cold Iron Series. I received a copy of Blade Dance via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review."}

{"text": "This was an exciting adventure read! I was well engrossed in it for a couple days. There for a little bit in the middle, I started to think that maybe it was too predictable, but then that abruptly changed and there was surprise after surprise hurtling the story along. \n The grammar and editing need some help, but I'm not one to let that get in the way of a good story. There's some adult content in there too, but nothing pointless or over-the-top. I appreciate a good, gritty read. Some of the scenes are a little fantastic, and stretch the imagination further than mine is used to stretching, but it's an un-apologetically Christian book, and some stories in the Scripture stretch me like that, too! \n The scene with the big battle in it is well thought out and reminded me of some of my dad's real time strategy games. The only part I liked better than that scene was when the hero and the heroine were fighting for the first time. That was comical and lots of fun. \n All in all, I'm looking forward to reading more of this author's work! And I'll be referring some adventure-loving friends in his direction. \n Oh!

{"text": "I received a review copy of this book via Goodreads' Don't Buy My Love program in exchange for an honest review. \n 3.5/4 stars for this M/M steampunk fantasy. \n I'm a bit torn as to my rating because the book was eloquently written, but I struggled with (slow) pacing. As delivered, this is three novellas packed together--and I kinda wanted the story to move...faster. \n Alasdaire is a bastard half-human/half-elf. He is the eldest grandchild to the ailing ruler of the Elven nation in this world. Due to his tainted bloodline, Alasdaire has never been to the Elven lands. In fact, after attempting to murder his derelict father (A Serpent Nation noble) he has been condemned to wear a lethal collar restraint and serve as a sex slave on the estate of the Serpent King's cousin. \n Prince Linden, brother to King Edward, is world weary. He's been battling to protect the fringes of Edward's realm, though he believes Edward to be insane--and over-interested in hastening Linden's mortality. Linden seeks respite and comfort in his cousin Keith's country estate--and he finds both in Alasdaire. \n Elves are detested throughout the Serpent Kingdom--reduced to slavery and unable to perform their magic due to Edward's decrees--but Linden finds Alasdaire entrancing. They strike up a companionship that is respectful and intimate. Over a period of weeks they become more than master/slave, and Alasdaire is distraught when Linden is summond to settle a new conflict afraid for Linden's life. With good reason. \n There are some soft twists, that mainly involve magic, Alasdaire's illegal practice of magic, and Linden's survival as a result of magic--Also, Linden's ascendance to the throne. Can their fledgling love survive the court intrigues and prejudice surrounding Elves? Also, Alasdaire's family rejects his love of a Serpent-Man--Linden. At first. \n I liked the world. The steampunk elements were interesting and handled with humor--ie \"Farting\" steam carriages that were so detested. Alasdaire was rather sympathetic, having been orphaned and abandoned--then later attacked by his deranged dad. Linden is a compassionate prince/king devoted to improving his lands with technology and egalitarian goals which is admirable. While the language is fun and flirty and in keeping with the \"steampunk\" milieu, I simply struggled with how ga-ga in-love Linden and Alasdaire were. The whole \"Our Love Conquers All\" theme kinda felt over-the-top for me, considering the characters in question were a battle-hardened, warrior-general prince, and a tormented sex toy. Also, despite all the assassination attempts, there seemed so little actual conflict--considering the length of the book. \n The sex was understated, and mostly negligible...sadly. I did enjoy that a M/M romance was accepted as the King's union. Even for fantasy, their relationship was open and unchallenged--with a plan to establish a distant cousin as Linden's eventual heir. This was refreshing. \n Unfortunately, I felt the story bogged too often and left me turning pages wondering \"Um, when are we going to get somewhere, here?\" which explains the lower rating."}
{"text": "So much potential so little follow through. The story was so slow and boring I kept wandering and the characters were flat and boring. \n I couldn't figure out why the gay friend (yes you're reading this right) accepted that this girl was reincarnated so easily. I'm sorry if my best friend said that I wouldn't just be like \"Okay lets help\" I'd think they were nuts. \n I can't tell about the writing of this author because the plot was so dull that it didn't show me what she could do. \n So Sad to see this story be so bad."}

There's definitely some surprisingly disgusting and perverse characters, but that's the way bad people work.

{"text": "See full review for Fracture at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n Delaney Maxwell is your typical teenager. She has a group of friends who's she's known all of her life. Her best friend is the guy next door and maybe there might be something more there that she's just too afraid to explore. She gets straight A's and might be valedictorian. She's normal, until she walks across the ice with her best friend Decker to play a game with their friends. The ice cracks and she falls in. By the time her friends get her out, she's been dead for eleven minutes. \n She wakes up in the hospital six days later with tubes in her mouth and shocked doctors looking at her. They thought she was brain dead. She's been in a coma for six days. But everything seems to be fine. That is until she sees someone later on that night come into her room and cuts her deep, and then the shakes start in her hands and her brain feels like it's itching. Shockingly, it has something to do with the fact that she was dead for eleven minutes, now she can sense when other people are about to die. She doesn't know what to do with that fact and tries to tell other people, but they think she's insane. Then she meets Troy, who has the same gift she does, only he's a little bit more bitter about it. He tries to help the people die quicker to ease their suffering. But Delaney isn't completely on board with that. \n I won't say that I hated Fracture, because there were some moments that were okay and the story line was kind of interesting. However, the relationships in this book - whether it was Delaney/Troy or Delaney/Decker - were just not healthy."}

{"text": "Empire State \n Written by Adam Christopher \n Read by Phil Gigante \n Empire State is a novel that sounds really great in concept but comes off a bit confusing in execution. This novel has it all - superheroes, detective noir, gangsters, prohibition, robots, alternate dimensions, you name it. If any or all of that sounds cool to you, this may be a book for you. \n The story generally takes the form of a detective noir once you get into it except that the story's perspective does not only stick with the detective all the time. As with detective noir stories, you don't know who is on which side all the time and things are slowly revealed as the story unfolds. Unfortunately, the story became confusing as things developed and the loyalties and motivations of characters seemed constantly in flux. The characters didn't have a whole lot of depth past being exactly what you'd expect from their role in the story (detective, gangster, old-timey adventurer, reporter, etc). \n Despite the confusion, I really liked the ideas and world that Christopher created in this novel. The world of the Empire State is a dark, foggy equivalent of New York that had me picturing scenes from Dick Tracy. I'm looking forward to seeing what else Christopher does in this world. \n Phil Gigante did a great job narrating Empire State. Voices for different characters were distinct and gave a great vocal aspect to the nature of the character being done. \n That said, I don't know if I would actually recommend this as an audio book. There were quite a few times I wanted to rewind a bit because I had no idea what just happened (I actually did rewind a few times which is rare for me). I think the ability to easily look back a page or two in a book would probably have helped with the confusion."}

{"text": "I will start with an admission I lurve a bit of vampire erotica/romance, and I lurve a bad boy !! Zane was introduced to us readers in Amaury's Hellion, and as soon as I read about him I wanted to know more and get into his character and back story, this book doesn't disappoint on these fronts as it gives you plenty of both!! It's hard to write this review as there are a few surprises along the way that I wouldn't want to give away and spoil anyone's reading pleasure, so I have given a brief outline of the story and my thoughts. I will also give a guarantee, if you have read the other Scanguards books you are about to become a member of team Zane, and you will not be disappointed lol :o) \n The book gets straight into the action with Zane being a vigilante and brutally killing a rapist. When Samson hears of his actions Zane has his class A authorization revoked and is given a baby sitting job looking after 20yr old Portia, while the Scanguard boss decides what further action to take. \n Portia is a hybrid vamp with a problem, once she turns 21 her body will set in it's final vampire form and she will be forever a virgin. This is something she doesn't want as every time she has sex as a vampire it will be a painful experience. With her father leaving town on business Scanguards are called in by her overbearing father to protect her virginity, whilst Portia is determined to loose it. There is an instant attraction between Zane and Portia and the chemistry is HOT, they have a will they won't they thing going on !! There are lots of twists and turns for the coupe and when Portia goes missing the full Scanguard cast is there to help. I love how the rest of the cast of Scanguards are always included and still developing in each book we are also introduced to Zane's oldest friend Quinn and his new buddy little Z ;O) \n I was very nervous before reading this book, the similarities between Zane and Zsadist from the Black Dagger Brotherhood series are very strong and Lover Awakened is one of my all time favorite books, I was worried this would be to similar to that and I would be disappointed...... well I need not have worried !!! \n I absolutely loved this character, he is the bad boy of the pack and the other guys always jump to conclusions regarding his actions and his character and think the worst of him. He has kept his past a secret from his colleagues and he isn't really close to any of them. His back story was heart wrenching and so well written, you could totally understand how and why he has become the cold calculating killer he is now and even feel his loss and sympathize. \n My only criticism would be that I wanted more, I could have read double what was written I wanted to know more about Zane's back story. I would have like more time for the build up of the Zane and Portia relationship and then I wanted to spend more time with the couple!! This is more a compliment to the writer for creating such good characters that I want to spend more time with. \n Overall another great book in the series, I cannot praise this series enough and it always gets my 5* rating. Now looking forward to the next book which I believe is Quinn's story :O)"}

Trust me...if I did not have to get up each day and go to work...I would have kept reading it in one sitting!!! \n OMG...this book makes you become like Tessa...and fall in love with two men at the same time... \n I am definitely going to read it again!!!"}

{"text": "Archangel's Enigma is undoubtedly the best in this series (however, Archangel's Storm is still my top favorite). I love how Nalini Singh went in details explaining a lot of different bonds -- Illium and Aodhan, Jason & Naasir, Elena & Izak (guest appearance by Janvier & Ashwini), Jessamy & Naasir, Andromeda & Charisemnon, Caliene's memories with Alexander & last but not the least, Raphael & Alexander. I'm a loyal fan of this series for a very long time and I look forward to new installments not just for the in-depth romance between one of the seven or their beloved but absolutely enjoy reading the intricate details of friendship, loyalty, love among family that is not bonded through blood. This is a near-perfect fictional world with grotesque evil, usual tragedy etc but it is also an inspirational world if analyzing the tightly-knit group of Seven, their mates and Archangel & his beloved consort. \n Now back to the two wonderful protagonists -- Naasir & Andromeda. Their chemistry, playfulness with each other, their wildness and loyalty was a delight to read. Naasir's origins being explained was one of my favorite parts and I also enjoyed reading about the debauched background Andromeda hails from. \"Andi\" is perfect for Naasir and their first \"rut\" scene is as raw and passionate as I would have imagined. Naasir is so carefree yet honorable to the deep core and it was such a delight to explore his character as the book progressed. There are a lot of beautifully written scenes in this book & i can't simply pinpoint one or two favorites since I have so many that I have bookmarked & will keep on re-reading! \n Thank you so very much Nalini Singh for Archangel's Enigma. The long, arduous, anticipated thirst has been satiated way above my expectations. I love you so much & look forward to your next installment in Guild Hunter series."}

{"text": "4 hazy stars \n I can still see through the haze of red smoke! \n For me, the romance in the book between Phury and Cormia didn't take the forefront attention. It held my interest only because I felt really bad for Cormia and I wanted to see her happy. At first, I thought she was weak and timid, but she definitely proved me wrong with the change in her once she came out of her shell. I love the friendship she developed with Bella and John Matthew. As a Chosen, Cormia knew of nothing outside the whiteness of the environment where her, her Chosen sisters and the Scribe Virgin lived. Once mated to Phury, she was brought over to the human/vampire side. There she discovered the magic of colors and vividness of life. Anyone would be scared and feel out of their element in a new and strange world, but Cormia had courage as big and bold as the strength of the Brothers. \n Phury... I liked Phury up to V's book because at that point, he was making me feel really depressed with his yearning for Bella. He was on a self-destructive path, fighting his inner demons and addictions. Phury has always been the most noble, the most loyal Brother. He would put others' needs before his own as proven by his sacrifice to rescue his twin Zsadist and also taking V's place as the Primale. That I admired in him. His inability to see what was in front of him, however, frustrated me to no end! I wanted to shake and smack some sense into him. His addictions had the better of him and it took a serious life altering spiral to make him turn things around. I hated to see him so tormented and not knowing what to do. He redeemed himself once he figured his true feelings and the fact that he was going to lose Cormia. \n I wouldn't really categorize this as paranormal romance as the romance part was only seen in the last couple of chapters of the book. It read more as paranormal/suspense for me. I really enjoyed the other plots with John, Blay and Qhuinn. As well as Rehvenge and the new development of the Omega and his son. The secondary plots really drove the story forward for me, which is what the 4 stars rating is for. \n I'm not an experienced M/M reader by any means. As a matter of fact, the only M/M romance I've ever read is from Suzanne Brockmann's Troubleshooters series. After this book, Blay and Qhuinn certainly piqued my interest. \n I must read on to eventually get to their story. I guess you can call me a self confessed addict of this series too!"}
{"text": "I just finished reading Released in preparation for Chaos to come out!! (in one day!!!)Released had me hooked from the beginning to the end. \n I loved the characters in the book, especially Abby. Abby had all of the characteristics that I like. She was a bad ass, but still maintained her femininity. Her brother Carter and their friend Max were a great team. Later Taya was added into the mix. At first I didn't care for Taya's character, but she grew on me as the book went along. \n I was a little sad that a couple of the characters were killed off, such as Norah, I liked Norah and the potential I felt she could've brought out in the plot. I'm sure there will be more characters to love to come in the next book. \n Now that I'm finished with Released....I'm ready for some Chaos!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text": "Source: eARC for Honest Review from Simon & Schuster via Edelweiss \n So this is not my normal genre but Jamie wrote it so I had to read it and I'm so glad I did. \n In the beginning with multiple POV's I thought it was a bit redundant but slowly it all came together and had me hooked. \n There were many tears shed and holy shit moments. Which I can't get into without ruining the book. \n But what I can say is it is a book about hope and starting new when you literally have nothing. It's about love when you least expect it. It's about so much loss and trying to survive from it. It's about never giving up. This book is both beautiful and profound. \n You get to see the events through here different characters and how they handle the end of world. \n Scarlet the tough as nails mom who never gives up and is strong not only physically but emotionally and mentally as well. She is put through so many scenarios that I have no idea how I would have handled them. \n Nathan the devoted and loving father who only wants to save his daughter but is calm and level headed when shit hits the fan. \n Miranda the daughter with a grudge because she's forced to be the strong one when she also needs to be taken care of which gets her in trouble when she starts to wander away from safe and secure. \n Even though the book is through these three besides Scarlett and Nathan I think Skeeter and cooper may have been my faves. \n If the end of the world zombie apocalypse book is not your normal thing give this a go I think it's worth the risk. \n For more reviews, visit Live Read and Breathe \n Like us on Facebook Live Read and Breathe Facebook \n Follow along with Twitter Live Read and Breathe Twitter"}
{"text": "I received a free copy of this book through a Goodreads giveaway! \n 4.5/5 stars \n This book was extremely good. I haven't seen a lot of hype around its release, but it deserves some. It is so much more than what the summary makes it sound like, and it definitely surpassed my expectations! It went from lighthearted and fun moments to darker, way more sad moments with ease and kept me hooked the entire time. Kiera does a great job of telling love stories that keep the the main character central to the plot, rather than only her relationship with her love interest, and that continued through this book. Although the summary implies that this book is a romantic story, which it partially is, it is more so about Kahlen as a person and her journey as a siren, and her relationships not only with Akinli but also with the Ocean and her \"sisters.\" I really enjoyed this book and I feel so lucky that I got to read it in advance!"}

{"text": "Once every ten years, the Dragon, a magician living in a tower nearby comes to the villages and chooses a 17 year old girl to bring with him and release her until the next choosing. Most of the girls come back changed, and leave to live in the city. In exchange, he uses his magic to fight the forest, a horrible and dark place that turns everyone mad and has monsters that kill or kidnap people. And when the forest takes you, is better to die than to live. Agnieszka was born on a year that would make her eligible to the Dragon, but her best friend and neighbor Kasia was born the same year and everyone knows she'll be chosen, because he always chooses a pretty or talented girl, and Kasia is both. When the day finally arrives, the Dragon chooses Agnieszka. The not pretty, messy, wild Agnieszka, that spends her time looking for berries and climbing trees. She eventually discovers that she was chosen because she's a witch, and the King wants every magician trained. But soon she learns that the magic that every other magician uses, including the Dragon, may be a different kind of magic than her own and that she can do things that others consider impossible. She may be the key to fight back the forest and save the kingdom. \n This is a wonderful and enchanting story. At times I couldn't even begin to imagine how things could turn out ok, but it has a wonderful ending. I loved Agnieszka. She is strong, insightful, smart and brave. She annoyed me at times because she was too shy and I wanted her to speak out and show her strength, but she was still strong in her own way. I loved the way she did magic, from the earth and not from words. She may be too powerful, but she's not a Mary Sue (at least most of the time). I loved Kasia even more, and I loved their friendship. They did envy each other but loved the other dearly, and they were strong because they were together. Dragon was my least favorite character. Even the prince was more interesting for me. He was just grumpy but sweet inside I guess, but I just didn't grow to like him. He just felt flat. But most of all I loved the magic, the small villages fighting against evil, and the forest. Oh, how I loved that evil forest, full of magic and hatred and a mind of its own. It was terrifying but magical at the same time. I loved the ending how everything originated from humans afraid of the tree queen and tried to kill her, but she couldn't die so she became a tree full of hate and consumed everything. I loved that all she wanted was to rejoin her sister, but forgot how. And that Agnieszka is healing the forest and destroying the trees so they can rest in peace. It also made so much sense that the people from the villages were bound to the forest, and the Dragon used the girls as a way to fight the forest. Once they were free from the its pull, they would leave and never come back. I also loved that Dragon tries to keep hiding from living, but at the end can't help to go back to Agnieszka."}
{"text": "Immortal by Nicole Conway \n I've been high on the Dragon Riders series since Avian, which took the characters and standard-but-well-done premise introduced in Fledgling and turned it into something darker and special. This series started off as Harry Potter meets How to Train Your Dragon, and the characters of Becca, Jaevid, Felix, Sile, and Jace were my favorite and carried the story well. Traitor deepened the story by taking Jaevid and Jace into Luntharda, the forest home of the hated gray elves. In the forest, Jaevid learns of mysterious parentage, his nature powers, and about Horvid's treachery. Jaevid emerges from the forest alone (Jace stays behind with the Elfen princess) with the knowledge that the king is an impostor. Que the beginning of Immortal. \n Felix featured very little in Traitor because Jaevid disappears to the forest early in the novel, but Immortal starts with Felix's temper destroying his career as a dragon rider. It's bad enough that Felix flees back to his childhood home. Felix is Duke now, and he promptly begins to drink himself stupid until Julianna comes back recouple him to his sanity. \n When Jaevid returns, he gathers 'the gang' together to betray the king. Everyone takes some convincing, but Jaevid proves the king is Horvid in disguise. When they fight Horvid, he is absolutely as nasty as you would expect him to be, which isn't a letdown. The ending is bittersweet, so don't go in expecting everyone to live. Still, it's a satisfying end, although most of the book is told from Felix's POV for...reasons. \n Rating: 5 stars A strong end to a strong series"}

That's the thing about princes falling in super gay outrageously forbidden modern love, the bravery. FayJay makes the point that in our times it is possibly the only way in which a prince CAN be brave at all, considering the way they're not allowed into wars anymore, it is only their words and everyday lives that can make the world better."}
{"text": "Betrayed by Blood by Tiffany Shand is a novella and the first instalment in The Amaranthine Chronicles Series. \n The book opens with Kaylan Avilion, a magic-wielder with various gifts and a sad past, coordinating with others to capture a sorcerer whom they suspect is selling certain illegal potions. The attempted capture goes bust and Kaylan's fiance Elijah is presumed dead. \n A year later, Kaylan returns to the city she once lived because her sister, Freya, has gone missing. There she learns that Elijah is still alive but has changed significantly. \n There is a lot of evil and many mysteries surrounding Elijah, Freya and the Order which governs the city. \n We are told that the Amaranthine are another kind of Order that protects the people, albeit secretly. \n I felt there needed to be more character development. Also, the beginning was a bit confusing for me. Until the end, I couldn't figure out which characters had what powers or abilities. \n Still, Betrayed by Blood has many interesting characters and I liked how Shand revealed certain aspects about her characters through events. A kind of show don't tell technique but through events. She also uses the \"throw problems in their way\" technique quite well. \n There weren't many images or beautiful lines in the novella so there aren't any quotes - there were a few lines but they are mostly spoilers, so I'm not going to quote them. \n Quick-paced and exciting, Betrayed by Blood is a suspense-filled urban fantasy novella. \n Overall rating: 3.5 stars \n (Note: I received a free copy of Betrayed by Blood from the author Tiffany Shand in exchange for an honest review)"}

But I'll explain why the low rating and I'm aware that I'm in the minority with my rating as well that the author did some more edits on the book while I was reading it. \n I'm a big fan of paranormal books; therefore, I'm a bit more critical and expect certain things. To keep it simple the book needs to hook me and needs to have a straight plot line; it needs to be original written in a way that I don't get bored; no storytelling that takes out the suspense of the story itself; the reading needs to be flawless and a good reading pace it important to me. \n The story of Angel Le Count was different from what I've read so far and that's why I wanted to read it but after the first 2 chapters the story took a turn and it bored me -sorry- to read it. It was more like a story telling than his story. I expected more suspense; more struggle from his side, more inside into his complex character what it wasn't the case. I read more things about the other character, more unnecessary details than what is really important in the story. It distracted me from the actual story. \n What also threw me off was the flow of the story; the throwbacks sometimes didn't work to the stories benefit and I lost track of the actual story. One big thing for me was the editing. I usual try to ignore grammar or sentence structure but it was a bit off. I had to reread certain sentences to figure out the meaning or what the author did mean. \n Overall the story had potential. I liked the idea of the whole plot and Angel's war spirit Sarre I liked but wished to read more about her. The demons in the story were interesting and after I talked with the author I know now that book 1 was meant as an introduction for the following books but the blurb didn't give this away and I really expected something totally different. \n Maybe you will totally disagree with my review but I promised an honest review and that's what I just wrote. I truly believe with some more editing the story will easily boost to a 4star rating. \n More about our blog visit us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/HookMeUpBookBlog"}
{"text": "While reading A Storm of Swords I wasn't planning on picking up A Feast for Crows right after finishing this one. I like to take my time devouring this series. Yet, while reading the epilogue that all changed; Lady Stoneheart was introduced. And in such an epic way, that I just had to continue. \n \"I prefer my history dead. Dead history is writ in ink, the living sort in blood.\" \n While writing A Feast for Crows, Martin soon realized the size of the book got a little bit out of hand. He decided to split the book up, not chronologically, but by characters and location. A Feast for Crows entails the stories of Queen Regent Cercei Lannister, Lady Brienne Maid of Tarth, Samwell Tarly, Arya Stark (also referred to as Cat of the Canals), Ser Jaime Lannister Lord Commander of the Kingsguard and Sansa Stark (also referred to as Alayne Stone, the daughter of Petyr she pretends to be). Some new characters get introduced as well, like Asha Greyjoy The Kraken's Daughter, sister of Theon. In total A Feast for Crows tells the stories of twelve Point Of View characters. The following book, A Dance with Dragons, entails the stories of among others Jon Snow, Daenerys, Stannis and Melissandre and takes place at the same time A Feast for Crows does. \n \"My old grandmother always used to say, Summer friends will melt away like summer snows, but winter friends are friends forever.\" \n The War of the Five Kings is slowly disappearing to the background. Tommen Baratheon, the eight-year-old brother of Joffrey, is now King of King's Landing. This means his mother, Cercei, is actually in charge, although this seems to be more difficult than she had foreseen. Tommen is to marry Margaery Tyrel, who married Joffrey seconds before he died, and although Tommen seems quite happy about this, Cercei is not. She fears the young Queen-to-be wants to take her place forcefully. Cercei played a big part in this book and I loved her tough statements. Even though I kind of like Cercei, and Margaery as well for that matters, I also loved how her story developed, even though this wasn't necessarily good for her (that I'm sugarcoating it here seems an understatement ;)). I can't wait to see what happens in A Dance with Dragons for Cercei. Her brother Jaime played a big part as well, but wasn't nearly as addicting for me as Cercei. \n \"Men had been looking at her that way since her breasts began to bud. Because I was so beautiful, they said, but Jaime was beautiful as well, and they never looked at him that way. When she was small she would sometimes don her brother's clothing as a lark. She was always startled by how differently men treated her when they thought that she was Jaime\" \n Three other story lines that became quite interesting to me, were those of Sansa, Ayra and Asha; three strong female characters. Although I always loved Sansa, in former books she could be a bit naive or annoying, even though she did everything she could to survive. In this book she continues adapting herself to the situation perfectly; she knows just what to do to remain \"comfortable\" and alive. I feel like her story line becomes more and more interesting. Same goes for Arya, who is also trying to build herself a new life, in the beautiful and mysterious city of Braavos, among the Faceless men. She is completely bad-ass, although that isn't exactly what is expected of her. Finally Asha, a new POV and an awesome one. Asha kind of reminds me of Cercei; they both aren't welcome in the world of power and adventures, which is in fact the world of men. Yet they do not take no for an answer and continue to fight for their place. \n \"We all deceive ourselves, when we want to believe. Melisandre most of all, I think. The sword is wrong, she has to know that . . . light without heat . . . an empty glamor . . . the sword is wrong, and the false light can only lead us deeper into darkness, Sam. Daenerys is our hope\" \n Even though I would love to wait a little bit longer with continuing the series, I don't think I can. I'll probably pick up A Dance with Dragons part I (I'm reading the books in Dutch and in these editions A Dance with Dragons is split up in two books) either next month or the month after that. This series is just so intense. I heard a lot of people found A Feast for Crows hard to get through or even quite boring in comparison to the others, but I loved it. Not my favorite characters, yet still super epic. And it left so many great openings for story lines in the next books. \n \"Behind it sat a woman all in grey, cloaked and hooded. In her hands was a crown, a bronze circlet ringed by iron swords. She was studying it, her fingers stroking the blades as if to test their sharpness. Her eyes glimmered under her hood. Grey was the color of the silent sisters, the handmaidens of the Stranger. Brienne felt a shiver climb her spine. Stoneheart.\""}

{"text": "I loved the magic, the story was less fabulous. \n I enjoyed the author's detail in regard to the clock, midnight dinners, and the magic in the different tents. \n That said, the story didn't seem finished - what I mean to say is I would have expected an editor to demand a face-off, some kind of building pressure, in both the challenge and the romantic passion throughout the book. \n The climax seemed to come out of nowhere even though it was growing for twelve months (and thirty-plus years). Only in the end did I grasp the enormity of keeping the circus together. \n I would love to read the final draft!"}
{"text": "I'm a huge fan of the show and the books were just great too. worth to buy :)!"}
{"text": "I had mixed feelings about this book. \n The main characters' relationship I found disturbing. Bella has battered women's syndrome and Edward's dating behaviors could easily be put on a list of red flag behaviors for single women to watch out for in order to avoid dating violent men. \n Fortunatelly Edward turned out to be a trustworthy person in the end but there is just something fundamentally wrong about thinking it doesn't matter if your boyfriend kills you because you would rather die than live without him. Something has to be said about having a certain amount of self-esteem and self-respect as a person. You don't have to be a narcissist to love yourself enough to care whether or not you live or die. Bella doesn't. \n Edward needed to learn how to take no for an answer and Bella needed to learn how to say no and mean it. Both leading characters could benefit from anger managment classes. \n Otherwise this was a really fun story. Stephanie Meyer is a good story teller and I thoroughly enjoyed the drama of the storyline. Particularly the bloody violent parts. I'm looking forward to reading the next book."}
{"text": "Loved it. Review to comeIt is only the first month in 2016 and I may have just found one of my top books for the year. Ink and Bone, while it was published in 2015, is one of the best books I've read in a while. It is a mix of adventure, a battle for power and knowledge, Harry Potter-like school setup, historical fantasy, and a Hunger Games like feeling. It might sound like it is a lot for one little book, but it isn't. Everything is well-written and works out. \n And the best part of it all? Ink and Bone deals with an issue that any booklover knows all too well - the thought of beloved books and novels becoming banned because the knowledge they contain is just too powerful. Toss in the issue of not being able to actually touch or feel books because everything is electronic based (the popular theory that eReaders will replace printed books someday) and you have a story that hits home to any bookworm. \n Ink and Bone takes readers to a futuristic world where the Great Library in Alexandria has survived. The survival of that one huge library has led to multiple Great Libraries popping up in multiple major cities all across the world. With the libraries' growth came power. The libraries are now responsible for controlling the knowledge and contents of books that people are allowed to access. \n People in this new, futuristic world get all their information on these electronic devices. The electronic devices are powered by alchemy. Original paperbacks and hardcovers are considered 'rare' and forbidden, which makes them like gold. This leads to an underground operation where book smuggling is popular, yet the higher ups do not like it and work day and night to put a stop to it. \n Of course, this library setup has started an almost all-out war. People either fall in line and follow what the library tells them, or they believe that all knowledge should be accessible regardless of who you are or what your status is. The second group is considered outcasts and rebels, and the library actively works to stop them at all costs. \n Ink and Bone follows the story of Jess Brightwell. His family is responsible for one of the biggest book smuggling operation. His family has decided to send him off to become a librarian and begin his training at the Library, but it is under one condition - he must spy for them. \n Jess works tirelessly to pass the tests that are being administered by The Library. After all, only a handful are going to granted the ability to become a true librarian. While he is training, he soon begins to realize that things aren't what they appear with The Great Library and those in power might not being doing what is truly best for the rest of the world. \n I will say that Ink and Bone started out a bit sluggish. The first 30 to 40 pages had a lot of details about the history, the setting, and the Great Library. While it was interesting to read, it didn't present an opportunity to really connect with any characters and since I didn't have enough background, I couldn't really understand what was going on and relate it to anything. I almost developed a 'who cares' attitude, but stuck with it. \n At the page 50 mark, things just took off. The book was fast paced, detailed, and unique. The training the librarians-in-training go through as well as where they stayed reminded me of Hogwarts. It was like an adult version of it. I think it was this familiar feeling that made me really connect with the book. It was no Harry Potter knockoff, but it had that feeling to it that made me really want to just keep reading. \n Ultimately, what I think made me love Ink and Bone was how true it rings to real life. There is a push to have books replaced with our eReaders, but no matter how hard people push for that there are booklovers (like me) who just love cracking open a printed book. The thought that not only could that be taken away, but that some mysterious 'higher up' would tell me what I could and couldn't read (and what those books contained) was fascinating to me. \n When I completed Ink and Bone, I wish I could jump right back into the world. I even admit, a small part of me wished I could test to become a librarian. I was that attached to it. Truly, I think Ink and Bone shows just how much the YA world is changing. It shows that YA books don't just appeal to the teen audience and are truly for everyone - regardless of age. \n I eagerly look forward to the second book in this series - scheduled to be released summer of 2016. I can't recommend this book enough. It really is amazing. It is magical, unique and fast paced. Give it a try and see for yourself!"}
{"text": "I am slowly working my way through the Oz series. I like the books well enough, but I think I would have enjoyed them more as a child, and I would appreciate them more now if I had read them as a child. \n This is the book off of which the movie Return to Oz is largely based, though the movie only loosely mirrors the plot. Still, this is a fine book, with some fun little details (like the Hungry Tiger who very much wants to eat babies, but knows he would feel bad about it after) and I don't hesitate to recommend it to young children and their parents."}
{"text": "I bought this book when a book store was going out of business. What brought me to buy it was the name and what I read on the back of the book. I started reading the first chapter and I couldn't put it down. I read that book in 2 days and was dying to buy the next one. \n I love the characters and what they go thought. Valek made my heart beat fast and I actually was surprised when he announced his love for Yelena. \n I'm glad the author didn't hold things back and let the picture to painted of what Yelena went through in her childhood that lead her to where the story starts."}

{"text": "I would consider myself a Chuck Palahniuk fan and I have read and thoroughly enjoyed most of his other books. This one however was a let down. The satire was shallow and toothless because its objects were such safe targets, character development was poor. There were some potentially interesting ideas but they were underdeveloped and thus seemed silly or uninvolving. This reads more like an extended outline or a rough draft. It is a very fast read, and has a few fun scenes and concepts, but this is below par for the author."}

Darkness begins to surround Rose as her secrets build and Lissa begins to tap into her magic. By the time all truths are in the open, people will be changed and lost forever."}
{"text": "I like the series enough to read all of it, but frankly, these books tend towards too much introspective-what-iffyness-worrying-guessing-hoping-re-evaluating internal dialogue at the expense of plot development. That is apparently becoming a pet peeve of mine. So many questions that could have been answered that I thought were integral to the story, left out for what after a while just becomes \"blah blah blah\" in my head, as I skim pages, which I really didn't want to do. The story line was great, and internal dialogue has its place. In my opinion it's better in smaller doses. Chloe could have exhibited much more of her talent, and instead the most we see is her sitting in a dusty heap reading for hours over something she has trouble understanding while Daegus wants nothing but to shag her brains out every time he looks at her. Her talent was reduced to little air time and I thought it was not very fair to her character. \n On another note, I am not ashamed to admit how easily I can fall for a Scottish brogue wearing long black hair, a kilt and an iron chest. I spend days telling my dog to \"get his little arse off the couch, we're going fer a wee walk ya little hound dog bastard\" and my husband (who is a McFarlane) to \"Haud yer Wheest and take me to bed ya lovely piece of Scottish ass, man, how many times do I have to fluff my breasts for ya?\" :)"}

{"text": "1.5 \n I could rant and spew spoilers as a result, but I will keep it short and sweet. \n ACOTAR and ACOMAF were always going to be tough to wrap up. There is one really good entry, one exceptional entry, and anything less feels all the more disappointing. However, this reaches a new level. \n \"A Court of Wings and Ruin\" suffers from so much. Bland, tired plotting. Repetitive, awkward writing. Uneven and random pacing. But I think ultimately, the problem comes down to focus. The first two books worked so well because amidst the fantastical world, long history, and brewing political tensions, there was a clear focus on character. Feyre, Rhysand, and Tamlin have been the heart and soul of this series. They are tricky, evolving characters that make every conflict feel tremendously personal. \n This book, however, completely neglects them. We spend so much time building to the climax, that they take the backseat to the larger military conflict. And as a result, there is really little reason to care. We get nothing from them. \n There was SOME emotional pay off, but mostly because of all the work the previous two books had done, so I cannot really reward this book for that. Sarah J. Maas has proven herself to be a terrific writer. I just hope that in her forthcoming work, she remembers why we fell in love with this series to begin with."}
{"text": "4 Lucas Loving Stars! \n Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Berkley | Penguin Group \n This book was so what I needed. I have been in a bit of reading rut with a repetitive loop of angst caused by assumptions and miscommunications so reading a different genre was exactly what I needed. I have had this book on my TBR forever and when Penguin gave me the opportunity to read this first one in the series I jumped on it. Book 14 Shards of Hope came out today so I was excited to start this series at the same time. Now I just have to find time to read 13 books so I can catch up. :) \n Sascha Duncan is a Psy. And the Psy are known to be emotionless creatures that live on logic not emotions. But Sascha's different. Because of the Psy's beliefs if she's different then she should be gone in their minds, now she has to hide these flaws to stay alive. \n Lucas Hunter is on the hunt to find a serial killer who is killing changelings, and Sascha's the key to finding out. Immediately after meeting Sascha he knows something is different about her. Now he just has to find out if that is going to hinder or help his plan for revenge. \n The more Sascha is with Lucas the more she starts to feel. The more she feels the more she gets confused. This part of her feels like the missing link but it also in her mind means death. For some reason Lucas can't stop touching or being near Sascha. His inner beast knows why just his human heart and mind haven't caught up. \n As Sascha learns the truth she has to pick sides. But with a chance to truly feel and live she thinks its worth it, especially since she won't be long for this world. Now that Lucas knows what Sascha is to him he will do whatever he can to keep her safe. \n This book was great. Sure yes it still had some elements of martyrisms and running but that got lost in this paranormal world. SHARDS OF HOPE (Berkley Hardcover; June 2, 2015), the 14th novel in the series releases today!!!!!

{"text": "Falling Kingdoms is the first installment in what I can tell is going to be an epic fantasy series. The plot of this book completely blew me away. So many things happened, and there were so many unexpected twists (not to mention unexpected deaths that kept me frantically reading.) The only reservation I have is that I'm not really a fan of any of the characters yet. They're ok, but many times as I was reading I found them annoying and I can't say I've grown attached to any of them yet. I place a lot of judgment based on how strong the characters are when I read a book, so the fact that I didn't really like any yet still devoured this book speaks that much more highly of its plot. Hopefully I will grow more attached to the characters as the series continues."}

{"text": "Honestly I think I'm too old for this book. Maybe if I read this when I was 14 I would've liked it but honestly... this book was a struggle to get through. I understand that I am not the target audience (so old I'm 21) but the characters were impulsive, annoying, and not thought out. It felt as if the author started writing one book and then changed her mind and started writing another and was too rushed by the publisher and put both books together. There were too many close calls that honestly just shouldn't have been added in because it made the book even less tolerable. I think that this book could've ended halfway through and then the other half should've been the next book maybe then this book would have had a better flow and rhythm to it. One thing I did like was the fact that there where separate religions and ethnicities and tgese differences were a notable part of the plot. It gave the story a bit of dimension and flavor to it which is very prevalent in today's world. (I hope YA readers were able to pick up on it.) In summation, this book was not for me there were many flaws with the plot, storyline and characters. Perhaps if I read this when I was younger I would have enjoyed it more. If you enjoyed it or want a book similar I recommend the series The Selection. (I read this awhile ago so my opinion might change but I do remember enjoying that book.)"}
{"text": "I don't read a lot of YA novels but of the ones I've picked up, I'm lucky enough to enjoy if not, come to love them. This one can be added to that list as well. \n Susan Ee's vivid writing and character development are the things that pulled me into this book. Although the pace was a bit slow in the beginning, it was necessary as it built up why/how these characters are the way they are, especially with Penryn and her mother. Their family dynamic and history is quite intriguing. \n The other interesting dynamic is the relationship forged between Penryn and Raffe, they each have an end goal, and they each need one another to get there. Penryn wants to rescue her sister Paige who has been taken by the angels, and Raffe wants to get his severed wings back on. Another aspect I look forward to finding out more is the political unrest between the angels. \n The secondary characters introduced in this book are also interesting and play integral parts as the story developed. What really surprised me in this book was the vivid descriptions of some scenes that sent chills up my spine and raised hairs on my arms. It's gory, and terrifying yet you can't look away. \n Very interesting first book and I will continue on with the rest of the series to see how Penryn and Raffe's journeys play out!"}

Read it.' And so began my love affair of Tamora Pierce's works. If I'm being completely honest Alanna was the book that really got me interested in fantasy - I mean, sure there was a Harry Potter a few years before, but that was just a taste - and I was a little reluctant to read her works now 15 years later. Books that I loved in my childhood that I've revisited as an adult haven't held the same power for me, and I was afraid the same would be true here.

At first I thought it was just a straightforward love story set in Vienna, and even then I was enchanted with it because of Carroll's great conversational writing style. Then things started to get strange and kept getting even stranger, until we were fully in the realm of the fantastic.

But...but...while good in concept - twenty-third in line to throne who finds herself made Queen because of a horrible dinner party? - and I even liked some of the characters, there was just something about this book that seemed to drag. I mean, I liked Freya, she had a brain and she wasn't afraid to use it. She didn't trust her gut when it came to acting in court, and while at first I found that charming, it did get annoying as she tried to not get killed by those who thought that she was the enemy. Even Freya's best friend Naomi got on my nerves, and that was only because it felt like she wasn't really there, that she was just a shadow. Same thing for Madeline, which I find somewhat disappointing considering how her character developed."}

The premise is interesting, but the focus veers away from all of that and delves into Thyra immediately trying to recruit a local yet somehow brilliant boy, Kai, to help her construct the mirror. This is a problem because Thyra's struggle with Voss and his old mentor, Sephia, could've made an interesting story if it would've been the focus. \n Spoiler: it wasn't. Instead of this more interesting book, we get Thyra chasing a boy, Kai, and adopting a puppy, Luki. I ended up enjoying Luki as an animal companion, but the fact that the dog is the most interesting character in the story says something for how shallow the remaining characters are. Thyra's character veers into Frozen fanfic territory. No, really, it's Frozen fanfic. She uses the phrase 'Let it go' too many times for this to be a coincidence.

But when someone pulls her there she does her best to cope with their requests, desperately trying not to fall for a Fae called Kieran, the hot dream guy who started it all. \n I like the world that Bast creates. A world where all Fae live in their own city and can't get out. Read full review here..."}

{"text": "Aedan is Book Three in the Harrison Ambush series. Aedan has everything planned on what he wants to do and one of the things high on his list is running for Governor. Everything is going along fine with debates and such - he thinks everything is great in his life. \n Nikki is a cop that we met briefly at the end of Cormac (Book Two in the series) - she has been hurt along with her granddad. She is taken somewhere safe that no one will find her until they know where her granddad is and she returns to keep him safe. When she meets Aedan (at his home where her granddad is), he knows immediately that Nikki is his mate and wants nothing to do with her or the mate business until she gets hurt again. \n Can Aedan save Nikki and protect her granddad? Will they stay apart because of who is after Nikki and Aedan running for Governor? This is definitely a must read and would recommend to everyone."}

{"text": "The second book in the \"Circle Opens\" quartet features Briar Moss, now a powerful fourteen-year-old plant mage, living with his teacher, Rosethorn, in the distant land of Chammur. While wandering the market place, Briar discovers Evvy, a ten-year-old girl who has stone magic. Like Briar at that age, she is a child of the streets, without friends or family to care for her. Unable to find her a suitable and willing teacher, Briar reluctantly takes her on as a pupil, but quickly comes to enjoy the role of teacher. There is a secondary plot dealing with gang culture, laying out sympathetically, though not positively, why some children and teens find it useful or even necessary to join gangs. Briar is forced to look at just how far he has come in the past four years; from an unwanted \"street rat\" to a powerful and respected mage. Like the previous book, none of the other three young mages appear, though they are frequently in Briar's thoughts."}
{"text": "This is written as if the first memoir from Lady Trent, a Victorian woman with the will to strive above that what is expected (and desired) of her.

Definitely hooked on this series (since I've seen there are quite some sequels already out there). \n \"But coming to terms with one's sorrow is one thing; sharing it with strangers is quite another.\""}
{"text": "There is a reason I have a Distracted at Work shelf and it is because sometimes when I listen to a book at work, I miss some of the story due to a boss that doesn't give me the time to pause the audiobook before she starts talking. So for anywhere from a few seconds to up to a minute or so, I miss what is going on in the book. (I sometimes wait and see if what she is saying is worth pausing the book for and that's why it can take as long as a minute to pause it.) When there are lots of interruptions, I can end up missing a lot and I don't enjoy a book as much as I might had I listened to it in my car or read it myself. I think this book was a victim to my work distractions. It had a very interesting premise to it and I'm definitely going to read the sequel to see where it goes but I can't tell you a lot about it since the story has so many gaps for me. The boss is out of town for a couple of days so I'll be much more focused on the goings on of book two."}
{"text": "9th&up \n Despite many familiar themes (basic Twilight plot points) and some clunky teen-speak (\"this guy had more lines than loose-leaf\", etc), this story was kind of fun. \n I'm a sucker for an ancient curse/portent of a destined true love. Add in some Wiccan action, confrontations with mean peers and the inclusion of a bad boy with a heart of gold, my looooong ago memories of my teen self cannot resist. \n Although this doesn't break new ground, it's not the worst of the teen paranormal romances that I've recently read."}
{"text": "This is one of the most beautiful books that I have ever read. I expected it to be dry children's fantasy, perhaps dark like the animated movie, but I was wholly surprised in a good way.

{"text": "This was a pretty standard plot. No surprises. I got tired of the repetativeness and so did not finish the last 1/4 of the book. Nor do I plan to read the second book in the series.

While there is curiousity about her second son and how she may end up at the end of the series, it is not strong enough to pull me through."}
{"text": "The Emperor's Edge by Lindsay Buroker \n I love stories about athletic women. It's a serious sweet spot for me, and Amaranthe is competent and strong from the start. She's written with enough vulnerability that she doesn't feel like a generic action girl. \n There was also a certain vulnerability to Sespian that I liked, too. Incredibly earnest and a bit goofy, he genuinely wants to make the world a better place, which makes rooting for him against his advisers easy. I also dug Sespian's crush because it felt teenage boy real. The theme of my reading week has been 'awkward crushes', and unfortunately, this plot ends up on the metaphorical backburner. \n The world of The Emperor's Edge is going to interest a lot of you. It has this neo-Roman quasi-American feel to it. There is the Emperor and a strong military presence with a strict caste system. One of the main conflicts is between the military and the business class, and while there's some touching on the Turgonian Empire's foreign issues and wars, it's largely left untouched in the first book. Amaranthe is an Enforcer, part of the military, but she's unusual in that she's a woman, which aren't usually recruited to the military. This makes Amaranthe an easy scapegoat when the notorious assassin, Sicarius, returns prior to the emperor's birthday, and someone needs to be blamed for his assassination (or more likely, needs to be sent to get murdered by him). Amaranthe unwittingly has a token from Sespian with her, which allows Sicarius to take an interest in her, and then she returns to the Enforcers, and then, she's tortured in a secret, underground bunker, and then she's left for dead...and it's only the first fourth of the book. My biggest complaint is that this book never slows down, and I thought the plot in the later part of the book (Amaranthe trying to crash the economy through counterfeiting) would be boring compared to the action-packed first half, but it wasn't. \n The counterfeiting plot introduces us to the other members of Amaranthe's 'team'. This is where I was hooked. I freaking love stories with odd-ball teams and ragtag misfits, and I ended up caring for (and enjoying) most of these characters and their illegal adventures together. Books is kind of the most boring character, even though he's recruited first, but then we get the #1 comic relief, Maldynado, who's a self-worker/rich boy/lazy-disinherited-son. If this book had only included Amaranthe, Sicarius (well-written enough to be interesting...it's hard to do that with more taciturn characters), Sespian, and Maldynado, it would've been a good book, but there's an ex-gang member/illegal magic user and former slave/pit-fighter in the mix, too. \n What I really loved about this story (and am continuing to enjoy about this series) is that there are little scenes that really stick in my mind and tug at my heart. There is a lot of complexity to this story (hey, world-builder fans, you'll love it!), but there are also these well-crafted personal moments. For example, Amaranthe and Sespian's flirting is adorable, and I was all about their meet-cute. Amaranthe's mission with Maldynado to the fighting pit was truly heart-breaking, and there's a moment where she feels so strongly for the slaves and realizes what a horror the business villain organization, Forge, is in the larger scheme of the world. Then, there's The Big Reveal (and no, I'm not spoiling that because it's not what you think it is and it's worth it), which is the moment I was waiting for the entire novel. There's no 'neat' wrap-up in this novel (it is the first of a series), but Emperor's Edge successfully launches a set of characters into a complex world. (And yes, I am reading more.) \n Rating: 5 stars. There is so much here, but the plot and characters are all genuinely interesting. It's action packed without feeling like it's cheating you on emotional moments. Sign me up for more."}

{"text": "Read my full review on The Bookshelf Intruder \n The Heroes of Olympus series has ended. And I was left with a broken heart. How do I move on? \n Warning: This review is a mess of feels. \n I had to get it out there. You can't say I didn't warn you. \n After 10 books (yes, I'm including the Percy Jackson and the Olympians books) here we are. Gaea is waking up and seven demigods -- Greek and Roman -- unite to stop her from destroying the world. As someone who's waited for this for a whole year, I had to literally drop everything (mainly \n This is What Happy Looks Like \n , which was the book I was reading at the time \n The Blood of Olympus \n came out) just so I can start reading the series finale. I was confident that this will be the best book of the series, that Rick Riordan will rise to the occasion and NOT disappoint me. Did it satisfy me? Stick around to find out. \n As in the previous books, there were alternating POVs. I have to praise Rick Riordan because not only has he made his readers love the awesome, brilliant, charming Percy Jackson (for more fangirling, please check this out) -- he's also manage to make us love six other demigods: Annabeth the wise girl, of course; Leo (who is second to Percy when it comes to awesomeness); charmspeaker Piper, the princess of the undead, Hazel; shape-shifter Frank (how he can turn into a swarm of bees is one of the world's biggest mysteries); and the wind and storm guy, Jason. I have to admit that I didn't like Jason before. I guess anyone who's read the series would understand. He's the son of Zeus/Jupiter who's like the most egotistical god. So Jason was this cool, alpha male and at one point, he was like Percy's biggest rival. Naturally, I am on Team Percy. But that's the thing with Rick Riordan. He's so good at character development that he makes us understand all these characters, makes us like and love them and root for them. And with seven demigods plus two more (Reyna and Nico) on the other side of the Atlantic, character development is no easy feat. \n There were five POVs... and none of them Percy's. Or Annabeth's. Which was my BIGGEST ISSUE HERE. I can understand that other characters should get the limelight, and that this isn't PJO anymore so it's not just about Percy, and that it's so hard to divide the chapters equally into nine POVs so some had to take the back seat. But why Percy and Annabeth? WHY? I was seriously pissed off. I was hoping that there would be even just one chapter each for my OTP. But no, folks. I was left to resort to Percy's funny dialogues and kissing scenes as seen from other people's POVs. Arggghhh!!! \n When Percy pulled away, Annabeth looked like a fish gasping for air. \n 'The Rivalry ends here,' Percy said. 'I love you, Wise Girl.\" \n Good thing there was Leo to fill the joke gap. The Leo chapters were the funniest... which was kinda ironic when you get to the ending. Oh, Leo... \n And then there's Nico with his dark, deadly chapters. It is so great and depressing at the same time to get into Nico's mind. This kid has been through a lot, probably more than any of the other demigods. At least when Percy dropped into Tartarus, he had Annabeth. But Nico, he was mostly alone, but intentionally so. I'm so glad that we get to see Hades' son in a whole new light. So much character development went into Nico and that moment in the end with Reyna was just... wow. It's just amazing how Rick Riordan wrapped up and opened at the same time (does that make sense?) Nico's story. \n Then she did something so unexpected Nico would later think he dreamed it. She walked up to Nico, who was standing to one side in the shadows, as usual. She grabbed his hand and pulled him gently into the firelight. 'We had one home,' she said. 'Now we have two.' \n And Reyna, oh I love her. She's so bad ass! Like Nico, she has her own ghosts (literally) and she's been through so much... but she's a praetor and she couldn't stand down. And I love that Nico gains a friend and a sister in her. \n As much as I hated that Percy and Annabeth (and Frank and Hazel) didn't get their own chapters, I cannot complain about the pacing and writing and overall quality of this book. Some bloggers complained that the ending was open-ended and that may be true... but it also felt wrapped up enough for me. I don't need a new spin-off series (a spin-off to a spin-off, that's kinda confusing) and come on, these demigods have been through enough. Maybe a companion book will do or an additional chapter... where ALL nine demigods are united. I need that in my life. \n It also helped that I read \n Percy Jackson's Greek Gods \n just a few weeks ago because most of the anecdotes and history behind the Greek gods, giants, and monsters are still fresh on my mind. A lot of the characters Percy mentioned in the said companion book were present in this finale. I felt like a history nerd while reading, really. \n But the true measure of a book's greatness, in my opinion, is in how it affects the reader or not. If a book doesn't evoke emotion, then that's pretty pointless, right? I can tell you with certainty that \n The Blood of Olympus \n made me cry like crazy. Tears were falling down on my cheeks as I read the last few chapters. \n 'Legion, cuneum formate!' Reyna yelled. 'Advance!' Another cheer on Jason's right as Percy and Annabeth reunited with the forces of Camp Half-Blood. \n 'Greeks!' Percy yelled. 'Let's, um, fight stuff!' They yelled like banshees and charged. \n Jason grinned. He loved the Greeks. They had no organization whatsoever, but they made up for it with enthusiasm. \n That wasn't even supposed to be sad, that was funny. And yet I was dabbing my eyes with my blanket while I read that part. It was so bittersweet. I had to read through tears. And all that time I was thinking of three things: \n 1. Oh god, it's ending. \n 2. Go, go, go, demigods! Kill Mother Earth! \n 3. Oh my god, it's ending!!! *ugly crying* \n It felt so surreal. I've only started reading PJO and Heroes of Olympus in a little over two years but it felt so much longer than that. By now Percy and Annabeth, and all the others including Coach Hedge, were not just fictional characters. They're my friends, my family. Cliche, yeah, but readers would understand this. They're not real people, but I felt real pain when I finished the book. :( \n Needless to say, I love \n The Blood of Olympus \n . If you haven't started reading the series, then lucky you. You're saving yourself from ALL THESE FEELS. I'm kidding of course. No I'm not. Seriously, you will go through all these BUT it will be worth it. \n The Blood of Olympus \n deserves 5 stars, it does. But since I'm still a little bit pissed off that there's no Percy and Annabeth POV, I'm giving it 4.5 stars (0.5 is a big deal, you guys). If you've read the book, please leave a comment or tweet me and join me in my cryfest."}

{"text": "4.5 Stars for this M/M shifter romance. \n Seb Calloway is a young single gay man who's not going to fall for a werewolf, unlike his best friend, Jared-who went and mated his wolf, Nathan. Nope, Seb wants his free will, even if it means never finding a true and fulfilling love...like Jared. \n Jared, now park of the Regent's Park Pack, is under their protection, and Seb counts as Jared's family-so he's protected even if he's not interested. Thing is, Seb's apartment seems to be the site of some low-level activity by other packs, notably the Primrose Hill pack, or a rogue shifter pack-and Seb is in danger. Plus, he gets injured and needs medical attention which brings Regent's Park pack Doctor, Tim to the scene. Tim has been infatuated by Seb for awhile, and he's ready to stand in and pretend to be Seb's boyfriend. Because, well, he hopes that Seb will grow to love him enough to choose to become his mate. \n This is a sometimes-bittersweet love story that mostly revolves around Tim and Seb, with lots of input from Jared and Nathan. The trouble stems from plot threads that occurred in the first book in the series, where Nathan and Jared fell in love. Nathan had broken some big laws, and important people want him punished. Seb recognizes he's a vulnerable pawn in this pack intrigue, and he relies on Tim more and more to secure his safety. Their bond develops naturally, and is a sexy experience, for sure. I liked the character and world development, and look forward to spending more time with these London werewolves."}

{"text": "I was very surprised by this book, but in a good way. Several years ago I saw the movie on television, so I thought I knew what to expect, but the tone of the novel is entirely different. Where the movie is humorous and light and feel-good, the novel is elegaic. The narrator's father's stories stand not as proof that he was a great soul but that he wanted to be a great soul, which is entirely different. I was also very pleased with the structure of the book. Instead of proceeding in some kind of chronological order, the father's stories are each told in their own chapters, some long and some short, in seemingly random order. This is a much more literary novel than the movie gave me any right to expect, and now I want to read more of Wallace's work."}

{"text": "See full review for A Feast for Crows at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n Shockingly, this book did not get thicker as the other two did. In fact, since Clash of Kings, this was probably the shortest. And the reason behind that is a lot of the familiar cast of characters were missing. Granted there were the obvious ones that were missing because they died at the end of the last book. But characters like Jon Snow and Daenerys aren't involved at all and according to Martin that was by design, otherwise book 4 would have been too long. Well, at least this shows me that he does understand how long these books are, but man I kind of missed my Dragon Queen and Jon Snow. But alas there are other characters to meet and lose."}

Well, obviously haha, I'm pretty sure anyone would hate someone who was holding a knife to their favourite character's throat! Plus, in this book you don't get our main character, Suze, in school. No No No No No! It was based in the summer and you even get to see her on her free time instead of that stupid school with all of those stupid people (You can tell I don't like her school 'friends') but you DO get to see her on her summer job! I'll tell you something, when you read up to her at her job, THAT'S when you got to pay attention and all the drama and action comes alive. If you don't pay close attention to.. *cough* new characters *cough* you might not remember who they are considering they will play a HUGE role later and in future books, just saying. \n The end, just like most of Meg Cabot's are, was very shocking because you learn some valuable information on someone that will make sense in the next book.

{"text": "When I read the synopsis for Stuck In The Game, I was immediately interested. It strongly reminded me of Ready Player One by Ernest Cline, if only because the story takes place in a Virtual Reality World, and Ready Player One happened to be one of my favorite books of 2015. So no surprise I was excited to read it. \n First of, before I start raving about this story (because yes, I loved it); this is not another Ready Player One. The story line is completely different. Seventeen-year old Noah experiences a terrifying car crash with his girlfriend and ends up in a coma. In a world where playing virtual reality games that feel very real indeed, is very popular, it is suggested his brain gets connected to the Dream Engine; a virtual reality helmet that enables his mind to enter a fantasy game. This way, via the game he can communicate with others and his mind is trained. Only one flaw; if he dies in the game, he will probably die in real life, because his mind won't be able to handle it. \n One of the things I loved about this book, was how soon I got hooked to the story. Normally I need some chapters to actually get into a book, but with Stuck In The Game I was addicted from page 1. I loved the idea of the main character continuously playing a game and the challenges, battles, skill building and exciting environments that come with it. I love playing games, so this definitely spoke to me, but I think it would be fun for most fantasy readers. I also loved how Noah meets with new and old friends in the virtual world. Finally, the plot twist came as a huge surprise. When the \"end chapters\" started I was kind of apprehensive; was this really how this book was going to end? But when it all went down it seemed logic after all. \n I really enjoyed this book. The only reason I didn't gave it four stars (although I might change my rating to four stars later after all), was because sometimes the book felt a little young for me. I received a copy of Stuck in the Game from Future House Publishing in exchange for an honest review, which I'm very grateful for."}
{"text": "\"The world will be saved and remade by the dreamers.\" \n Empire of Storms is the fifth book in the Throne of Glass-series and o. my. god. I can't believe that Sarah J. Maas just keeps being able to completely suck me into this world. The writing style is nothing special and not every story line is really up my alley, but these are some of the very few books that I just cannot put down once I start them. I remember starting Heir of Fire while studying for a test for university the next day (okay, who was I kidding starting that book at that moment; bad timing), and being sucked in so badly I literally ended up barely studying at all and finishing the book within a day (still passed the test with 65% though, thank god). \n I just love the different story lines and how these intertwine more and more, I love the intense adventure, I love the detailed world and its history but most of all I love Aelin. From day one she has been this super epic bad-ass heroine, and even though I hate arrogance, her arrogant moments are the best. Nope, this may not be the best piece of literature out there, but I cannot wait for the next book to come out (might reread all the books before starting that one though; some details from the earlier books have completely left my mind) and the excitement these books give me is amazing. Four freaking stars. \n O, and Manon and Aelin coming together? BEST IDEA EVER. Was waiting for that from the moment we met the wicked witch. \n \"A dry, hot breeze flowed through their little bubble, and sparks danced like fireflies at Aelin's fingers, her hand hanging casually at her side.

{"text": "Wrapping up a series is always difficult. How do you resolve everything? Which characters survive? Many complain that this book is too long. In some ways, it is -- but all the same, it's the conclusion of an epic seven-part series and I devoured every word. It answers many questions. It brings everything into perspective. Rowling draws together the silver threads of previous books in order to resolve the conflict between Harry and Voldemort -- in a brilliant way. True, I saw some of it coming, but other things caught me by surprise. My first time through, I read it all in a day-long stretch, stopping only to cry as some of my favorite characters met heroic ends. As always, when you reach the final few words, you feel a sense of peace and happiness at Harry's happy ending -- but also a profound feeling of loss, in leaving so many friends behind. \n But, as Rowling has told us, no matter how many years pass or what draws our attention in the meantime, whenever we push play or start to read, Hogwarts will always be there to welcome us home."}
{"text": "It was amazing and mindblowing and exquisite and a million other synonyms I can insert here. Let me just start by saying that I hate when there are two AMAZING guys and the heroine has to choose between them. It just pisses me off. So I was a bit wary when I started this book because I anticipated that either Jem or Will will sacrifice themselves for Tessa or just die or turn evil or remain friendzoned forever or things like that. That's what usually happens. \n So this is when my congratulations for Miss Clare comes in. She weaved her tale so skilfully and created a great storyline that I wasn't at all disappointed by Tessa's decisions by the time I read the epilogue (although I did feel that waiting 130 years was cruel for Jem). I love both Jem and Will; they were great characters and contrasted eachother deeply. The ending was perfect. \n Bonus point to whoever illustrated the covers for the Clockwork trilogy. It's incredibly realistic and it helps that the guys on the first two covers are really hot."}
{"text": "4.5 stars, just because I struggled so much with the beginning of this book and it took me a long time to get into it. Once I did get into it, however, I read the last 280 pages in one sitting!"}
{"text": "I read this, no devoured this book in one....yes ONE day. I enjoyed the banter between Cadegan and Jo, loved that her \"crazy\" family was involved and his as well. As I was reading this I got a taste of Medieval, which was different but good. Very descriptive! Love how the characters come together. Seems we are getting ready to have a come to Jesus meeting with Bad vs. Good. Love it!"}

{"text": "A Great New Light Paranormal Mystery Series \n The uptight, inflexible heroine sees herself as a hard boiled, tough talking female investigator like her late father. But when she takes on a serial murder case just as she finds out she's a witch might be more than she can handle. This is a great PI story with the paranormal component nicely woven in as part of the main character development and the community that surrounds the heroine. Any one who loves Sue Grafton will love this series. And anyone looking for light paranormal cozies will enjoy the world that Ms Abbott introduces in this debut book."}

{"text": "The quest for the final star leads the group of six guardians back to Ireland, where deep roots lie for Bran and Doyle. \n This book explores the connections of the characters and their ancestors leading back to the goddesses. I enjoyed the search for the star as I did the first two books. The only thing I wanted more was the connection between Riley and Doyle. It felt more like a relationship of convenience. They were the only two single people left, and even the beginning of their relationship was a no frills enjoy it while you can sex. I wanted a little more than that for them. \n Overall, I still enjoyed the story and the epilogue was nice. Would've liked to see them a few years down the road to see how they lead their lives though."}
{"text": "This may be the fifth time I've read this series, but it's the first time I've read it slowly, and the first time I've paused between chapters to think not just about the more exciting aspects of the plot or how much I like some of the characters, but to really look at some of the concepts Pullman is taking on and appreciate importance of this series. Despite the fact that Pullman has put together a great plot, and told his tale with an almost poetic beauty, there were moments when I couldn't believe he managed to find a publisher willing to take on some of the more controversial subject matter in the context of YA literature. But I am so glad he did, because the ideas here are profound, and they are not ones that young people are often exposed to in such a sophisticated way. Not to say I love everything about this book or this series. Frankly I think far too long is spent faffing about in the world of the dead, and while I know it's important to the plot, it does drag a bit after so many re-readings. But the ultimate message of the series -- that we cannot live our lives for unprovable ideas or in hope of another world which may or may not exist, but that we must do what we can to create the best possible world where we are -- is beautiful and satisfying. Four stars for this book, and five for the series overall."}
{"text": "Great opening to what I'm hoping will be a fantastic fantasy series! \n The characters were fantastic, flawed, and complex, the world is rich and vast, and there is just so much potential for the remaining books that it makes me so excited for what's to come! \n I did have some problems with it: The instalove was my main issue; it wasn't even so much that the relationship developed instantaneously, it was that it just wasn't developed. It felt a bit awkward and I wasn't happy with it, but it made sense in regards to the rest of the story and what happened, I guess. \n Overall, I really enjoyed this, and I'm definitely going to try to get my hands on the next book as soon as possible!"}
{"text": "Ok, I know this series is super beloved, but this book just wasn't my thing. I do think that it has to do more with personal taste than anything else, because I really like Sarah J Maas and the Throne of Glass series. I will say that this book was really close to being 3 stars, but I couldn't do it because I came so close to DNFing this book many different times. The whole first half of this book just dragged on and on to me. I didn't really feel like there was anything particularly likeable about the main character or the love interest, so that aspect didn't hook me into the story either. However, I was never a fan of the actual story of beauty and the beast to begin with, so that is why I blaming most of my dissatisfaction on taste more than anything else. I did find the character of Rhysand very interesting and was more into the story by the end, which is why I think I will continue on with the series eventually and I am very hopeful that I will like the second book more. Maybe this was just a situation where it was the wrong book at the wrong time. There wasn't anything that I outright hated about this book, I just found it boring and difficult to get through."}

{"text": "2.75 stars \n So basically, I only have two reactions while reading this: \n and \n Seriously. \n A friend of mine convinced me to give this book a chance because he said this one's much better than the first. That, I agree. No, scratch that. This one's not better , just, more... tolerable. \n Shatter Me, shattered my brain while Unravel Me shattered what's left of my brain. Ugh. \n First of all, look at the paperback cover (it's included in my eBook). Stare at it for a few seconds and try not to cringe. Feel it? Creeps. Creeps everywhere. \n So, Tahereh Mafi's back again with her cringe-worthy metaphors and way-too-trying \"poetic\" lines it makes me want to choke. Here are some of my favorite lines from this book: \n Maybe it's snowing, maybe it's raining, I don't know maybe it's freezing it's hailing it's a hurricane slip slipping into a tornado and the earth is quaking apart to make room for our mistakes. \n I catch him looking at me, looking like he might inhale the length of me in one breath. \n Heads still spin in my direction when I walk into the dining hall. (The visual that came in my head while reading that line isn't pretty. Is the word \"turn\" not enough for Mafi to used \"spin\" and head in the same sentence?) \n His breath is hot and his breathing shallow and the heat from his body is melting my blood only to splash it across my cheeks. \n Loneliness is a strange sort of thing. It creeps up on you, quiet and still, sits by your side in the dark, strokes your hair as you sleep. It wraps itself around your bones, squeezing so tight you almost can't breathe. It leaves lies in your heart, lies next to you at night, leaches the light out from every corner. It's a constant companion, clasping your hand only to yank you down when you're struggling to stand up. (I honestly didn't see any sense in this one.) \n Wind is gnawing at the windows, straining against the walls. Rain is popping against the roof like popcorn against a pane of glass. The message from the sky is clear: we are pissed. We are pissed and we will punish you and we will make you pay for the blood you spill so freely. We will not sit idly by, not anymore, not ever again. \n We will ruin you, is what the sky says to us. \n How could you do this to me? it whispers in the wind. \n I gave you everything, it says to us. \n Nothing will ever be the same again. \n I don't even want to know how on the heck did Juliette came up with that conversation. \n And my favorite. (enjoy the visuals): \n Adam's pain is like a handful of straw shoved down my throat. \n Normal Authors: \"I blush.\" \n Tahereh Mafi: \"Heat like hot oil spatters across my face.\" \n Normal Authors: \"I can't breathe.\" \n Tahereh Mafi: \"And the wind grabs me by the throat.\" \n Moving on. \n Juliette is back again as a wallowing-in-self-pity cunt. And it's so darn frustrating. So I just want to thank Kenji for what he said. \n \"Bullshit.\" He laughs a short, sharp, angry laugh. \"All you do is sit around and think about your feelings. You've got problems. Boo-freaking-hoo,\" he says. \"Your parents hate you and it's so hard but you have to wear gloves for the rest of your life because you kill people when you touch them. Who gives a shit?\" He's breathing hard enough for me to hear him. \"As far as I can tell, you've got food in your mouth and clothes on your back and a place to pee in peace whenever you feel like it. Those aren't problems. That's called living like a king. And I'd really appreciate it if you'd grow the hell up and stop walking around like the world crapped on your only roll of toilet paper. Because it's stupid,\" he says, barely reining in his temper. \"It's stupid, and it's ungrateful. You don't have a clue what everyone else in the world is going through right now. You don't have a clue, Juliette. And you don't seem to give a damn, either.\" \n You go Kenji! Four for you Kenji for that peace of mind. \n I would've given this 2.5 stars if I don't pity Adam.. \n BTW, am I the only one who see the resemblance of this series with the Mara Dyer's Trilogy? Especially the ending of Unravel Me and The Evolution of MD?"}
{"text": "Give this book 4.5 stars. \n Really extraordinary. \n Completely love the ending. \n More slays, wars, and fights make the adventure be so excited. \n No matter how hard they have to face with, they still grasp the hope to be brave, be stronger. \n The relationship between Raffe and Penryn is so adorable. \n Love them soooooo much. \n Glad to finish this series. \n If I still need to wait for another book of the series, it MUST be a TORTURE for me. \n I still can remember how painful of waiting for the sequels of this series. \n Fortunately, I just finish it."}

It is joy to see in my student's eyes that same fascination, that same longing to read MORE, that same contemplation \"wouldn't it be WONDERFUL if I could be transported to another land where I'd have wonderful adventures and experience Aslan?\". I have the pleasure of peppering them with questions (What do you think will happen? Where are they? What do you WANT to happen? Do you think X is an enemy or friend?

{"text": "Check out my other book reviews at my blog; The Title Page \n Closed Hearts is the sequel to Open Minds, a novel set in a world where everyone normal is a mind reader. Kira, however, is not normal. She's a jacker. Jacking is a special skillset in which the Jacker can enter and ultimately control a Reader's mind. \n In this novel, Kira has exposed the jackers to the public, and is set on a mission to free the trapped jackers and protect the ones she loves. \n I found this novel to be slightly disappointing compared to it's predecessor. Kira has completely changed in terms of her attitude and determination. In Open Minds, she would stop at nothing to bring Kessler down, and in this one she gives up two separate opportunities to do just that. \n Her regard for those she loves is pushed until the end of the novel, only then does it occur to her that the best thing she could do to protect her loved ones is to leave them behind. \n Her powers which were considered so remarkable in the first book seem weak and useless in this one. At times she can defeat extremely skilled jackers and at others she can't even get in the heads of weakly protected readers. The inconsistinsies in her skill make me think the author got worried that Kira might become a Mary-Sue type character. Her attempts to correct this leave Kira a weak, unimpresive protagonist and one I'd much rather see replaced. \n Honestly, I would much rather the story continue on in Julian's perspective, he is the stronger character and while mysterious, much more developed. \n Another large red flag to me in this novel is that so many of the Mages' enemies are jackers. Being a jacker, wouldn't you want to help a group that is fighting solely for jacker rights? Or at least do not stand in their way. The anti-jacker readers would be completely powerless without their jacking body guards. This is like saying gay people would fight against gay rights. It makes absolutely no sense. \n One of the biggest disappointments I think is the scene set up. The big climax of the book takes place a good amount of time before the ending, almost at the halfway point. If I was an editor, the beginning and end of this book would not interest me enough to back it. \n All over, this book is an obvious read if you enjoyed the first book. I would suggest reading it only in hopes that the third one will be much better, and you'll need it to fill in the space between the two novels."}
{"text": "5 '450-Pages-of-Awesomeness' Stars \n Review contains light spoilers \n I was one of those lucky girls that got an ARC from Lauren and I literally took my sweet time reading it. I was waiting of this book what seems like forever -yeah blame my patience for that- and she didn't disappoint with what she delivered. Strange Case ended exactly how I wish it'd be; no super cheezy ending, no super HEA, but with a new beginning for Mitch & Eden. \n Did I want this series to end? -Hell no! I could and would like to read more of Eden and Mitch. Such an abnormal couple, but so loveable!! So it's obvious I'm a bit sad this series is over... \n Strange Case starts off where book 2, Jekyll ,ended. Eden was held captive by The Clinic, endoured such cruelty, before Mitch saved her, by giving himself up, doing whatever he can to keep his Eden safe. \n Aftr that, Eden hat only two things, two important things to focus on: \n \"Finding a way to bring Mitch back... Number two was making absolutely The Clinic paid for everything they'd done. Murder, rape, kidnapping and deceit were expensive hobbies.\" Mitch was out already 8 days, since he \"had given himself over and they'd brought the facility down.\" \n So yeah, Eden was beyond pissed, worried and wanted revenge, peace, and a piece of herself back... a piece that she lost while held captive in the clinics walls. She wanted Mitch back; without him she felt lost, shut off her emotions and was just a shell of her former self. It got harder and harder to look at this chained version of Mitch; his Hyde was killing her, killing her by knowing he held Mitch, the man she loved so much, hostage inside. \n But she refused to give up...to give up on Mitch...she knew he would somehow make it make back, back to her...even if her heart would break little by little while waiting \n \"...it's really hard to be light-hearted when your heart is broken. When every moment of the day is painful. When a constant reminder of all you've lost is chained up in the next room.\" \n \"When Mitch disappeared, her emotions did too, tucked into her subconscious, useless.\" \n Mitch... he was still this cocky, dirty mouth bastard but this time with a much more softer side- I loved this side on him!He proofed himself as fighter when taking out Hyde01 to safe Eden, and bringing down The Clinic, but he also proofed himself that so much good is in him. He truly fell deeply, for the very first time, in love... In love with no other than Eden. He never imagined being able to love anything or someone, as hard as Eden. She was his Yin to his Yang, his missing piece of his puzzle to complete him... she was everything to him. \n \"if it comes down to you or me, I will always choose you.\" -Yeap I love him like that...which girl wouldn't be a goner right?! I could keep posting so many things he said, things that made my heart warm and wish for someone like him. Yes, he truly opened up and Lauren showed us a side of him that made me fall hard for him even more. \n Mitch loves Eden for so many different reasons and doesn't, can't let her ruin herself but giving in to her abnormal side to get her revenge ... \"I love her more than you can possible imagine. I've brought her more pain than I can possible imagine. But she would still give up her soul for me, and that's exactly why I can't let her.\" \n Let's not forget about our fav ex-cop Landon, he was still a big part in the third book and he kept Eden and Mitch sane when they were about to lose it. I really really liked his character and was thrilled to read his little happy ending too - he deserved it so much!! He made me laugh and sad to the same time cause I knew he deserved so much more, especially after losing literally everything because of The Clinic. He was a strong character and a best friend to Mitch. \n Strange Case is the continuing story to finally bring the person down who's responsible for all the pain every Abnormal had to go through. It kept me on edge till the end because Lauren did a great job stretching the suspense to the very last. But don't think this series is just an Urban Fantasy book, because if THEN YOU'RE WRONG. It's \"a story that can be crude and cruel but\" it \"is in it's heart, a love story.\" And it truly is, it's a slow building love story about two abnormals that fight to finally live a happy life. \n I love you, Eden Colfax. You made me love you. ... Everything good inside me is for you. Because of you. ... Thank you for choosing me. \n ~Mitch"}
{"text": "This audiobook was so distracting as I knew the narrator was pronouncing names incorrectly. Aisling sounds like Ashling, not Ayesling. Kahlen does not sound like Collin but Kaylen or Kellen if it is to be like Kaitlin and Ellen mixed together (which isn't divulged by the author until the last few minutes or pages of the book). Every time I heard the narrator say Ayesling, I corrected it in my head. Every time she said Collin, I wondered what the hell she was really supposed to be called. Seriously distracting. \n All this definitely took away from the general feeling I may have had for the book itself. It was an average teen urban fantasy. Not bad, but not so amazing that I would ever read (and definitely not listen to) it again."}

{"text": "3.5 Looking Forward to this Series- Stars \n \"The steps I'm sitting on are beginning to crumble, steep stones the color of blood. The house is getting old. The first step in matching the family that calls it home.\" \n I can honestly say I'm looking very much forward to read this new vampire series! Twelve vampire houses rule over and alongside the humans, each of the houses been having for the past hundreds of years a Scion - a human that fights and stands side by side with the houses and its Prince/Princesses. \n Unfortunately, The Ravens, House Cantelie, has no Scion. She got killed.... Octavian's aka The Blade, biggest regret and grief. \n \"Some call us the death omen- because when Father speaks, and is ignored, death follows.\" \n The prequel was great, seriously great. It gave the right amount of background information to know who is who, who's part of House Cantelie and most importantly, why Octavian's is troubled. It did hint on unsolved tensions and family drama (which is common is most vampire families/novels and I seriously suck this up stuff up :) ). Bring it all, I'm down for some rebellion! \n Overall this series features some promising strong vampires - females and male alike - that are just looking to cause trouble and refusing orders. Totally my cup of tea!! \n If you're a fan of paranormal books I'd say snatch this free prequel now, getting somewhat to know the House Cantelie - The Ravens - because it's a great intro, providing a glossary beforehand to avoid confusion. \n http://amzn.to/1l8lBoN (free prequel) \n ** THE BLOOD SCION (bk1) comes out Nov 24 ** \n ___________________________________ \n Read all my review (A-Z) on the blog \n Like the blog on Facebook \n Email subscription to my blog"}

In this review I will mostly write about my reactions and less about the story itself (you def need to read Hyde first to understand). \n This book wasn't filled with sexual tension as the previous book was because of the different location (The Clinic), but god damn, it was filled with suspense!! I dont know how many times certain ppl, the one working for The Clinic, pissed me off by their actions/words, or that I wish I could slap them- for real! During reading I got impatient because yeah Lauren, ur writing is freaking awesome and I was sitting on the edge, nervous as hell, to find out who's behind everything. I also was nonstop begging that Mitch aka Hyde and Eden aka Jekyll will make it, find back together, and fight those ppl. \n Yeah this book held many surprise and it was plain awesome!! It had so many twists that when you thought 'aaah it'll def be like this or that' big fat nope, Ms Stewarts took a total different turn.... guess you can tell, I had mostly no idea what's happening next. \n Mitch's character helped a lot to left me hanging. His moods, thanks to his inner Hyde, made me trip. His actions, jeez sometimes I could slap his handsome face, for acting irrational!! Eden tried and tried to make him realize but nope, Mr Stubborn thought and did differently. \n When i thought I know how it'll end, what did Lauren do, she ended again with a cliffhanger...gosh woman, I love you but it drove me nuts!!thank goodness a third book will come out this summer and yeah i'll be one of the first to read it. \n Thanks again Lauren for such a great book, I loved it, even tho it drove me nuts, I truly did!! Like i told you on Twitter, you have a new fan :) \n I can only recommand this series, it's different with many surprises, a hot Mitch, beautiful Eden and a twist of sexy Urban Fantansy"}

{"text": "I can't say it was the most awesome book ever, but I definitely think I would have enjoyed it a lot when I was about 12. Wilma Sturtz is one of the most unpopular girls at Claverford, a private middle school in New York City. She's smart and she's nice, but she just can't break into the \"in\" crowd, and she's afraid befriending other unpopular kids will ruin any chance she might have at a social life. One day, Wilma gives up her subway seat to an old lady. The witch -- for so she is -- rewards Wilma by granting her wish: to be the most popular kid at her school. Suddenly everyone loves her, wants to hang out with her, is telling her secrets, and all the boys want her to go to the dance with them. But it's not as good as Wilma expected. Every time she makes a new friend, she finds herself wondering if that person would really like her without the spell. Things get worse when Wilma realises that the spell only applies to kids at Claverford, and that the magic will run out in three weeks when eighth grade is over. It's a pretty thinly-veiled morality tale about the disappointments of superficial popularity, but with good tips on how to really get people to like you: Be kind, be confident, and don't take yourself too seriously. While the story is simple, Levine is an excellent writer. Her turns of phrase are wonderful and her characters are all unique and believable. A good one for kids who are worried about fitting in."}
{"text": "Categories/Genres for this class fulfilled by this book: YA \n Estimate of age level of interest: Grades 8-12 \n Estimate of reading level: Grade 8 \n Brief description: \n Gwenyth knew she was from a family of time travelers; the gene was given to her cousin Charlotte. What she didn't know is that her and her family's assumptions were wrong--the gene was given to her. Along with her new time traveling buddy, the hunky Gideon, Gwenyth must figure out this new way of life an how to travers it so that she comes out alright in the end. \n Identify at least 2 characteristics of this genre and subgenre and discuss how they appear in your book: \n Young adult literature makes its protagonist a teenager, someone the audience can relate to. Gwenyth is that character (Chance, 11). She's a modern-day teenager who is awkward and holds angsty feelings toward her grandmother. She crushes on and gets super annoyed with her new time traveling partner. All in all, she's believable in this unbelievable situation. \n The style of YA literature also includes a lot of dialogue that avoids long descriptions (Chance, 11). Gier does this in her writing. She writes from Gwenyth's point of view in a way that is down-to-earth, humorous, provides believability in her character. The movement of the book is fast-paced and driven equally by actions and relationships. \n In what ways and how well does the book as a whole serve its intended audience?: \n YA girls will relate instantly to Gwenyth's awkward nature and will be attracted to Gideon's hunkiness. They will enjoy the idea of traveling to different time periods and being dressed up with period clothing, people doting on Gwenyth and driving her around in limousines.

Nora, the main gal, is obsessed with Patch (in a Bella/Edward/love/hate/dangerous kind of way) and even though he TELLS HER in no uncertain terms his intentions she just goes about, willy-nilly, against all instincts, like those annoying bimbos in scary movies where you are standing up and yelling at the screen to not go up those stairs! \n Ahem. \n Obviously, this book causes all sorts of dramatic emotion in the readers, which is a good thing about the book, but she may drive you insane and cause you to scream madly at life in general.

What a disappointment, as I thought the first book was pretty original, not mention neat. I loved how Hoffman took both real history and religion and spun them into his own little world. Although I really liked the intrigue, both political and emotional ... the battles are just painfully confusing and poorly written. So much so, it made 10s of pages completely unreadable, which is really sad because I love all the characters from Bosco to Cale. I think the best part of the are parts that focus on the development of Vague Henry and his relationship with Cale. Hopefully, Hoffman reigns it in for the 3rd."}

Like cat wearing a hat cute. \n Cats wearing hats are the cutest. \n It took me much longer to listen to than normal because I listen to audiobooks while I cook, and lately, I've been either super sick or super injured. Just wanted to clear up that it wasn't a reflection on the quality of the book (audiobook). \n Young Benjamin and his father live in the Crystal Kingdom. One day, they are attacked by a mass of Orcs and Benjamin learns that not only are Orcs not just a scary bit of a story, his father is actually a wizard. Magic is real! His mother has been taken and they set off to find her. It turns out that Benjamin's mother has something called Teleportation Sickness. Long story short, she is subjected to random trips via teleportation without knowing where she's going. Like I said, absolutely adorable. Benjamin and his father set out to find another wizard that can help and from there the adventure begins! There are dragons, draughrs, mages (and yes, mages and wizards are different!), wizards, centaurs, orcs, and a super intelligent donkey with a goat for a girlfriend. So.freaking.cute. \n I just loved this book/audiobook. Seriously, I overcooked a couple of things listening to it. It was fun, original, easy to listen to, and just...pleasant. A real pleasure to listen to. I'm a sucker for a good middle-grade book every once in a while and this really scratched that itch. The narrator was fantastic and I felt like a kid sitting cross-legged on the floor of a classroom again. I really have no issues with it at all. It was funny, fast paced, and just delightful. I look forward to the next installment. \n *I received a copy in exchange for a fair and honest review."}

{"text": "See full review for Tiger's Destiny at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n Everything that Kelsey Hayes has done for her tigers has led to this. After being kidnapped by Lokesh in the last book, she must find a way to get out before he can do what he wants with her. But because he has so many pieces of the amulet already, his powers far exceed her own. Her only hope is that her two tigers are on their way to find her. Because once they rescue her they still have one last sacrifice to find to break the curse, but this one might take the most from all of them. \n Look, I don't want to waste too much time on a summary of what happened in this book. All you need to know is that there was a lot of drama, adventure, romance, and loss. I loved that Tiger's Destiny diverted a little bit from it's usual pattern of figuring out the clues to find the final sacrifice and instead went straight to Kelsey's time with her kidnapper. If I thought Lokesh was a disillusioned villain before, I thought he was downright crazy in this book. There were a few moments in the first few chapters that I had to go and do something else because Lokesh was being just a little bit too creepy and the way that Kelsey was trying to play him was a little bit disturbing."}
{"text": "This book totally erased all doubt I was feeling after reading the first book. I had seen the movie before reading the book, and because it's a pretty faithful adaption I felt myself skimming the first book and waiting for it to end. I wasn't sure if it was becuase I already knew the information or if it was the writing itself, but I adored this second installment, so my doubts have been vanished. \n The second book picks up right where we left off in the first. I was really hoping that we would get to explore more loops in this book because that concept is so interesting to me and I was not disspointed. Ransom Riggs continued to use vintage photographs to further this story and take it to interesting and original places. Reading these books is a lot like reading Harry Potter for me. I love all of the children so much and I love the innocence that they bring to the story as they naviagte these pecular places and people while facing dangers that ordinary children would be unable to face. I am excited to start the last book but sad that such an original and fun story will be coming to an end."}

{"text": "See full review for Illusions of Fate at: http://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.w... \n I think the best way for me to describe Illusions of Fate is this way: take the play Romeo and Juliet, add in some magic, and have the women have a more important role and you've pretty much got this book. \n Jessa is a student on the mainland of Alben. She loves to learn and despite her mother's protests went to school instead of trying to find a husband. The only way she got into the school however was by threatening her father - a professor at the school who had an affair with her mother a long time ago - and she feels the hate from her fellow students. Jessa isn't from the mainland. She's from an island that everyone doesn't like and that animosity shows when her fellow students call her island rat and tell her to go back home that she doesn't belong with them. But she doesn't care because she's doing what she loves, she's learning and not back on the island getting married and taken care of for the rest of her life like her mother. \n That is until she runs into Lord Finn Akerley who takes an immediate interest in her, and whom she can't help but feel somewhat interested back. But Finn isn't who he appears to be. He brings with him a cloak of mystery and an enemy who Jessa doesn't want to cross. Not that she knows that until it's too late. Lord Downpike takes her hostage thinking that she is the key to getting what he wants from Finn, and he tortures her until she makes her escape. But it isn't the last she sees of the minister of defense as she enters a world much bigger and dangerous than her studies."}

{"text": "Audiobook narrated by Marc Thompson \n Star Wars Aftermath is the first book of the newly renovated Star Wars timeline to take place after the original movies and it doesn't live up to the hype that surrounded it. We were enticed by the potential for details of what happens after Return of the Jedi but details of the main heroes are doled out sparingly while the main part of the story involves mostly new characters. This isn't quite the journey to the Force Awakens I was hoping for. \n The main plot follows those new characters, Wedge gets some screen time in there, and we get small glances of the rest of the universe through small little interlude chapters - which are the most interesting parts of the book. We get to find out some hints of interesting things going on elsewhere in the universe and it's the unclear nature of those hints that make them so interesting. \n So what about the main story? It's fairly standard pulpy Star Wars action that I honestly can't really remember a whole lot of because nothing particularly stood out. Some of the remnant of the Empire decide to hold a secret meeting somewhere they don't have firm control (or also not somewhere in deep space) so that Rebels (or New Republic people) could stumble upon them and we could have some nice \"stuck on a planet\" moments. I've seen some criticism of the writing style but I think the main problem this book has is that the plot doesn't really seem to matter in the grand scheme of things. Besides, I don't look for fine writing in a Star Wars book anyway - I look for fun and action. \n As for the audio side of things, Marc Thompson and the sound engineers did a great job as per usual. Thompson does a great range of voices and impressions even though he didn't really get to use many of those impressions in this book. His Wedge sounds a lot more like Luke but Wedge doesn't really have as much of persona from the movies anyway. The music and sound effects were great as they usually are in Star Wars productions."}
{"text": "I've had to take a few days to really process this book and get my assessment in order. This will be a tough review to write. \n Let me first start off with I loved, loved, loved the first book. I told anyone who would listen about it and brought copies for friends. I'm not sure what happened with this series but had I read this book first I wouldn't have gushed about it. WAIT! That doesn't mean that I didn't like this book. I liked it, I didn't LOVE it. Here's why. \n There didn't seem to be as much adventure in this book. Part of what I enjoyed was the edge of the seat adventure and thrills. Which just weren't present in this book. \n This whole book focused on a mystery and Will Swyft uncovering that mystery. There was a little bit of an adventure/fight at the end but not what drew me into the first book. \n Also I felt a lot of this stuff was sorta thrown out there and never fully developed. The whole \"weapon\" for Scar-Crow Men to be exact. \n Scar-Crow Men is still filled with all the history and real life people that I liked in the first book. And in fact, there's a secret society. \n But here is my main problem with this novel. I finished the book (which ends on a b it of a cliffhanger note) and I feel as if the novel moved an inch. The plot line from the first book is no more advanced than when I left the first book. \n That being said. The third book? I really have HIGH expectations for because I view this second book as a sorta setup for that third book. I guess only time will tell :)"}

{"text": "This was cool sequel I will admit. Instead of having trouble with little possessed Kasey anymore we now have a different type of possessing, but instead on Alexis and Megan. It was interesting to see the after effects on Alexis's family's life after what happened in the last book. Kasey was in a psychiatric home and had just come back from her treatment and we find ourselves living in a whole new different neighbourhood. Kasey is starting her first year of high school and all she wants to do is be normal and have normal friend. Well that's a little hard for a girl to do when she's been possessed by an old grumpy vengeful spirit. After all, everyone remembers Alexis's little sister breaking one of the most popular cheerleader's little sister's arm. Who could forget that? \n While Kasey is adjusting to high school life she becomes friends with a new girl and weirdly enough, Lydia. Yeah, the weird emo girl from ALEXIS'S old group of friends. Anyways, they join this Sunshine Club where basically all of the girls, including Kasey, get turned into these amazing, beautiful, fashionista type popular girls. Alexis and Megan right away knew that something was up. I liked the friendship between those two a lot in this book. It really shown through how much last book's events bonded them together even when they were enemies just a couple months before. Alexis and Megan then have this bright idea to join the club themselves because again, they smell something fishy going on. Yeah not really a good idea considering the spirit that is turning these girls into psycho's and beauty pageant girls isn't all that perfect and innocent as he seemed. Especially with his creepy ass book. \n I couldn't quite believe how serious things got towards the end and a huge twist happened that left me shocked and sad. If you don't want to get spoiled I suggest not reading the description for the next book, like at all. It ruins it on the first few sentences, so just a disclaimer and warning on that. Basically this book made a great sequel to the series and I'm really liking Alender's writing style! It was fun to read and really makes you anxious, just like the first! \n p.s.

{"text": "My introduction to this series started long before every preteen and their freakin' grandmother was reading it - a friend sent me the first book for Christmas. I read it, found it entertaining, and went back to my life. I thought little of it, but now, revisiting the series after five movies, countless articles, and everyone from Stephen King to my pastor weighing in on the series, I'm picking up on... well, a lot that I'm surprised didn't annoy the hell out of me the first time around (maybe it did, I don't remember). \n For the four people who haven't read this franchise, it's neither as glorious nor as horrific as many would have you believe; people inevitably either fall into the \"I love it, and it's flawless\" side of the argument, or the indignant, angry, bashing sort who love insulting the intelligence of anyone who does like it. I fall into neither camp, because I try to be objective about things - and there are some good and bad aspects to this book. \n The good is that whatever you think of her purple prose and leading characters, Stephenie Meyer certainly knows how to tell a story, take a popular topic, and bring new things into it. What other franchise has their vampires playing baseball during a thunderstorm? Her use of \"gifts\" with some vampires is brilliant - Jasper can control others' emotions, Edward can read minds, and Alice of course can foresee the future. \n Her misfortune, therefore, is to stick us in the minds of insipid, immature, neurotic teenagers, when she has a host of infinitely more fascinating characters at her fingertips - Carlisle, the son of a fanatical pastor in the 1500's who gets attacked and turned when hunting vampires in London, strikes out on his own and eventually winds up with the Volturi? Now that is the story I want to read! Or what about Alice's stint in the mental institution under shock therapy, until a vampire smuggled her out and turned her--only to be killed by James? Dammit, Meyer, how could you spin such an intriguing story in five paragraphs and leave me to wade through 500 pages of Bella tripping over stuff, Bella admiring how gorgeous Edward is, Bella biting her lip, Edward being bipolar, Edward getting \"angry\" and frightening Bella (who doesn't care if he eats her, it's just she doesn't want him upset with her first), and... well, just Bella being Bella. \n Much has been said about this series and unfortunately, once you've heard it, you can't un-see it. I was painfully aware of the awkward writing, the amateurish usage of words other than \"said\" that were redundant (the dialogue expressed itself well enough without needing \"stressed,\" \"explained,\" or \"shouted\" at the end of it), and, more noticeably... the undercurrent of Bella and Edward's twisted, codependent relationship that unfortunately reads like it comes out of the abusive boyfriend handbook. Controlling her? Check. Constantly putting her down and making her feel self-conscious? Check. Mean-spirited teasing? Check. Blaming her for your own damn problems? Check. Feeling remorse when your choices put her in danger? Check. Stalking her and checking up on her every five seconds? Check. Edward's rapid shifts from anger to laughter make him look unstable at best, and psychotic at worst. I question my own sanity in ever liking Book!Edward (and I did, when far younger and much dumber). \n I never thought I'd say it, but for once the movie is better. Why? Bella is less pathetic. Edward is less of a creepy, bipolar manic-depressive twit. And the secondary characters have more of a chance to shine. Plus, you get to see the vampire baseball game in action. Meyer does suck you in and hold you tight. I just wish an editor had shaved three hundred pages off the manuscript and they'd dealt with some of the stalker-y tendencies before it went to print. But oh, well. People loved it anyway. \n Next up, the book where Bella spends 450 pages whining and then comes SO CLOSE to being eaten by Aro... \n Sigh. Pity."}

{"text": "The fourth Lukien novel John Marco has published, \"The Forever Knight\" is a break from the format and story of the previous books, giving new readers an excellent opportunity to dip into this saga. Cursed with immortality by the spirit living within his sword, Lukien begins this novel restless and aimless. He's a man who lives a life without consequence. When the ancient spirit in your sword can heal you of any wound, mortal or benign, what challenge is there in living? \n Despite the teaser for this book, this book does not dwell on the Inhumans or Lukien's roll as their protector. With the usual grace of a fantasy novel, Lukien is cast out into the world on a quest, sword in hand and companion at his side. While the stated goal of the quest is to find answers to his companion, Cricket's, past, it's obvious what is really the objective - to find a purpose and challenge to satisfy an immortal knight. \n In my mind, two things set this novel apart from many fantasy novels. The first was the decision to present this tale in the first person. For new readers especially, this can be daunting in second world fantasy, where there is no frame of reference for understanding the environment and cultures around the POV. Marco succeeds here by painting with broad strokes, sketching a world and people we can almost see, without lingering on the details that aren't relevant. Not a common choice, but the first person worked well for this story. \n The second factor that set this novel apart from so many other epic fantasy novels these days was breadth. At 282 pages, it's a relatively light contender compared to other tomes available. I would continue to argue that this isn't a bad trend to see in books these days. Presenting readers with a single, well drafted adventure can be so much more satisfying than a collection of adventures sewn together for the sake of bulk. \n In both efforts I think Marco succeeded with \"The Forever Knight.\" An entertaining adventure story that was extremely accessible for a first time reader, and a well written introduction to a new chapter in this character's journey."}

{"text": "Ebbene ci sono cascata in pieno, fregata da una sinossi e da un prologo molto promettenti. \n Ho chiuso l'ultima pagina di questo libro ieri notte, e ancora adesso non riesco a capacitarmi, dell'enorme fregatura che ho preso. \n Andiamo per ordine: \n 1)La trama: atmosfere cupe, inquietanti, misteriose ed enigmatiche... ( ho pensato perfetto alla \"Mara Dyer\"). Ma quando mai!!!! \n Sin dalle prime pagine ho capito, che questo libro non sarebbe stato nulla di tutto questo. \n L'autrice presenta una serie di avvenimenti, e non riesce bene a dare, ne un senso logico, ne una consecutio temporum decente. Violet ed il gemello Luke sono stati \"parcheggiati\" dai genitori artisti/svitati/bohemien, in un villone mezzo diroccato in cima ad una scogliera. \n Senza soldi ed in balia di se stessi, i due ragazzi sono costretti ad affittare la dependance, ad un perfetto estraneo... \n Eh fortuna sfacciata, non si presenta il figone/riccone/sexy/stronzo/inquietante???? \n Che fa Violet? Accoglie River a braccia aperte... Ovvio no! \n Attenzione: dopo appena un paio d'ore limona il tizio di brutto, sbava e gli scodinzola sempre intono... Anche se il tipo e piu inquietante dello Zio Fester della famiglia Adams! \n Lui e un bugiardo/assassino/svalvolato/ambiguo. \n Lei e senza un briciolo di cervello, non possiede un minimo istinto di conservazione, ha spesso uscite da sbroccata, ed indossa i vestiti della nonna morta= Svitata completa! \n Luke, il fratello, e una via di mezzo tra l'asociale e l'adolescente sempre ingrifato. \n Sushine la vicina e sempre a caccia della palpeggiata, inoltre riesce a essere un mix di antipatia e idiozia. \n La nonnina Freddie era una vera bomba: anticonformista, spregiudicata, dedita alla bella vita e ai suoi diversi amanti. La stimo. Ma e morta ahime! \n Non parlero degli altri personaggi per non spoilerare la storia, ma sappiate che soltanto l'ultimo in ordine di apparizione riuscira a resuscitare un tantino la trama. \n 2)Lo stile: confusionario, ambiguo, carico di similitudini e metafore che spesso risultavano snervanti, ripetitive e senza alcun senso logico. Per non parlare dei soliti 3 termini ripetuti come una cantilena: diavolo, maledizione e maledetto. \n L'autrice non ha saputo dare incisivita ai personaggi, sopratutto alla protagonista che sembra soltanto una squilibrata! \n Luoghi e situazioni descritti in maniera vaga, che non rimangono impressi nella mente. \n La cosa che ho detestato in assoluto di piu, e stata la totale devozione di Violet per River, messa in dubbio al massimo per un nano secondo.( non giustificabile con il bagliore!) \n Omicidi di massa, torture, roghi, e cattiveria gratuita, tutto reso \"plausibile\" da uno pseudo senso di giustizia privata?!?!?!? \n Ok sei un diavolo, ma dato che hai degli incubi terribili, possiamo dormire abbracciati e baciarci come se non ci fosse un domani! \n L'incoerenza e il perno attorno al quale ruota l'intero libro, oltre che alla svalvolataggine di Violet. \n Delusa dall'ennesimo libro, che non ha saputo rivelarsi interessante come la sua sinossi."}

{"text": "#9 Best Sellers of all time, estimated 100 million copies sold (Source: Wikipedia.org) \n Published at just under 400 pages, The Hobbit has a feel of brevity when compared with Tolkien's later works set in Middle-Earth. He was wise to begin his public endeavor with this story about a small quiet hobbit caught up unexpectedly in the great events of a medieval world. While the first chapter does contain some explanation of Bilbo's hobbit race, genealogy and habits, The Hobbit doesn't contain the detailed world building for which Tolkien came to be known (and criticized). \n The thing that is particularly interesting about Tolkien's writing is his use of language. Not only did he invent languages for his Middle-Earth world races, but his English words are chosen and assembled in such a way as to drip with epic meaning and other worldly structure. The very manner of presentation immerses the reader in another time and place. Tolkien's desire for perfection of this vision lead to voluminous corrections because editors insensitive to his precision tried to make 'helpful changes' that he believed ruined the flow of the narrative. \n Tolkien himself is an interesting study and the subject of several biographies. From his early life in South Africa to the loss of his parents at a young age to his academic achievements, he famously overcame quite a bit for an Englishman of quiet domesticity. An intellectual, he transformed teaching and understanding of Beowolf and also published fantasy stories for children. His professorship at Oxford, transformation friendship with C.S. Lewis, participation in the writer's guild The Inklings, and international fame that came from his creation of Middle-Earth propelled him further into the limelight. Having not read a biography on him at this time, post in comments any that you would recommend and why you liked them. \n Overall, this is a wonderful first exposure to Tolkien's Middle-Earth history, adventure and language. But, just like the people of the 1940's, I doubt you will be satisfied without reading more, at which point, you will want to check out the Lord of the Rings series, beginning with Fellowship of the Ring. However, everyone I know, even those of us who love Middle-Earth, has a burn out point that occurs for the reader before it does for Tolkien whose life, and that of his sons, went into elucidating Middle Earth history and settings. Most have read the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings series, but I know very few who have studied the notes throughout the books to internalize Tolkien's incredible level of detail, nor do I know anyone who has conquered the additional depth of The Silmarillion. If you have, take a bow in comments! \n Finally, the Peter Jackson films on the Hobbit, for which many were optimistic, are a disappointment (both to me and reviewers and general) and performed poorly at the box office. Then the project was announced, I thought three films from the short book was overkill. I prefer, with caveats, the Lord of the Rings series and would have enjoyed two films on each of those books.

{"text": "I would give this book four stars based on overall enjoyment, but I can't in good conscience from a writer's stand point. It's not just the redundancy of language (overly adverbed phrases and too much repeated, unnecessary details like people licking their lips or fingering things on their person... constantly.) It got bogged down just a little in the middle when our characters got broken up into 3 different groups and each group encountered new and different societies, but most of them lacked significance in the immediacy of the story. I was about to over look it all since I still enjoyed learning about this new world in a 'book 1' context, but then in the last few chapters after everyone was back together before their final action there was a long info-dump explaining a character's back story and learning history of yet another place we have not visited, and then summarizing \"new info\" about what had really been going on during their trek away from Two Rivers, and there was nothing truly revelatory, shocking, or secret about it. I feel this novel could have been much revised and condensed without loosing any hints or clues to things yet to come. I still enjoyed the over all experience, and I'm continuing on (because I love Brandon Sanderson and I trust his writing-sense to tie up this whole series well with the last three books he wrote)."}

{"text": "The plot of this book was so compelling to me. What if you aren't the chosen one? What if you were just a random student at Hogwarts, trying to pass your OWLs while watching Harry, Ron, and Hermoine running around doing whatever it is they do? \n This book is extremely well written. It's told in first person, and the tone is really authentic and relatable. The other thing I really liked about this book was that it was just so different. It covered issues like mental disability, sexuality, and race and worked them naturally into the story in a way that I have never seen done before. I feel like the majority of young adult fiction should be headed in this direction. \n What I thought made the book really cool was that at the beginning of each chapter you got a little blurb about what the chosen kids were doing, which followed all the tropes a story like that normally would. But the story wasn't boring. If anything, it showed that everyone is the protagonist in their own life, and even if you don't feel special, or you're not the chosen one, you still have a story worth telling. \n The one thing that really made the story for me was that the plot stayed true to itself throughout the entire story. I liked the idea of telling a story through the innocent average bystanders eyes, and I was worried for awhile that the main character was suddenly going to become the hero, but the story didn't need that. You were rooting for the main character to fix his own problems, and sometimes ordinary is enough."}

[?][?][?](e+10+e1)[?][?][?] \n This story has six main characters, but there are only five points of view since Wylan doesn't get his own chapters. Besides that, each character I thought was amazing. They are misfits and not the typical heroes you would root for. \n \"They'd come to the Ice Court scurrying like rats. Live or die, they were going out like an army.\" \n You want them to successfully pull of the heist. They all have their own reasons for joining the crew and they aren't necessarily friends at first. They are supposed to rescue a scientist in order to get paid. Even though Kaz carefully plans out their mission, things do go wrong. It was really exciting reading all the action packed scenes. I was kept at the edge of my seat. I felt the book was at it's strongest when the crew finally managed go to their destination. \n I found this book to be much darker than the Grisha trilogy, since this book did include topics of slavery, prostitution, and annihilation of the Grisha, even though the story mainly focuses on the heist. I did like how this book included references to the Grisha trilogy such as King Nikolai. *swoons* _ \n Though there were multiple points of view, I did not confuse each of the characters because they were all unique and their backstories are great. The heroines are kickass, strong, and powerful. There are no love triangles. That's right, no love triangles! Yay! I did feel that each character had a sad backstory. \n There is Kaz, the mastermind and leader of the group. His backstory was really sad and he does grow on you. He can be at times heartless and brutal. This is the best description of Kaz: \n \"He's horrible.\" \n \"But effective. Being angry at Kaz for being ruthless is like being angry at a stove for being hot.\" \n Inej is practically a ninja and cunning. Kaz trusts her more than anyone in the crew. She is fierce and amazing. She and Nina are an amazing duo and serious friendship goals. =(**>s<)** \n \"She was not a lynx or a spider or even the Wraith. She was Inej Ghafa, and her future was waiting above.\" \n Wylan is a genius that comes from a privilege background. He really surprised me because I thought he was going to be the weakest of the group, but he proved me wrong. \n Nina is a Grisha who is loud and flirtatious. I love how snarky she can be as well, but overall she is such a great friend. She is willing to sacrifice her life for the ones she loves. She is my favorite character. \n Jesper is the comedic relief of the story. He is charming and sometimes is the voice of reason when the others fight. There is more to him than being a sharp shooter. \n Matthias is an ex-soldier who is often grumpy and hates the Grisha due to his upbringing. But despite that, he is strong and lovable. He and Nina are a perfect balance. \n The three couples were great as well, even though they don't really get together. Keep in mind that this isn't a romance driven book. My favorite pairing is Nina and Matthias. They had such romantic tension and it is also a forbidden love. Nina is a Grisha and Matthias is a soldier who kills the Grisha. I really like them together. They have gone through so much before joining the heist. I like how the two of them grow closer because of the heist. They are just cute together. 2( * )7 \n \"Oh, I see. I'm the wicked Grisha seductress. I have beguiled you with my Grisha wiles!\" \n She poked him in the chest. \n \"Stop that.\" \n \"No. I'm beguiling you.\" \n I occasionally did get bored of reading the story because it felt that not much happened during the first half. Once you get to the second half, the story becomes far more interesting. I wasn't expecting two plot twists! I can't believe that it ended on a cliffhanger, but I am really excited for the second book in the series. I really recommend this book. You don't really have to read the Grisha series to start this book, but I do recommend reading it because it is a great series as well! ((*><)( \n Quotes: \n \"Many boys will bring you flowers. But someday you'll meet a boy who will learn your favorite flower, your favorite song, your favorite sweet. And even if he is too poor to give you any of them, it won't matter because he will have taken the time to know you as no one else does. Only that boy earns you heart.\" \n \"When everyone knows you're a monster, you needn't waste time doing every monstrous thing.\" \n \"He needed to tell her...what? That she was lovely and brave and better than anything he deserved. That he was twisted, crooked, wrong, but not so broken that he couldn't pull himself together into some semblance of a man for her. That without meaning to, he'd begun to lean on her, to look for her, to need her near. He needed to thank her for his new hat.\" \n \"I can hear the change in Kaz's breathing when he looks at you.\" \n \"You... you can?\" \n \"It catches every time, like he's never seen you before.\" \n \"She had her aim now, her heart had direction, and though it hurt to know the path led away from him, she could endure it.\" \n \"I want you to stay. I want you to ... I want you.\" \"You want me.\" She turned the words over. Gently, she squeezed his hand. \"And how will you have me, Kaz?\" He looked at her then, eyes fierce, mouth set. It was the face he wore when he was fighting. \"How will you have me?\" she repeated. \"Fully clothed, gloves on, your head turned away so our lips can never touch?\"<...>\"I will have you without armour, Kaz Brekker. Or I will not have you at all.\" \n \"They fear as I once feared you,\" he said. \"As you once feared me. We are all someone's monster, Nina\" \n Final Rating:[?][?][?][?] (4.5) .. .:*deg.. .:*deg.. .:*deg.. .:*deg"}

After reading mixed things about it and then reading Fallen and feeling disappointed about Fallen, and then hearing that Fallen was just like Hush Hush, I almost didn't bother picking it up. \n But then I did, and I read it, and I liked it because the plot kept moving and the characters were interesting and the plot twists were way cool. Am I allowed use the words way cool in a book review?"}
{"text": "I loved so many things about Passion Potion. \n First of all, it was different. The voice was unique, the tone was out of the ordinary. It really doesn't fit with anything else I've read. The best I can place it is sort of like the earliest books in the Vampire Diaries, where it didn't take itself to seriously, it was told very straightforward and the story really depended on the characters to carry it. There is very little description, but the details that are added are of the world building and parameter building variety, rather than telling you the curtains are blue and the kitchen is painted green. In other words, every word matters. \n The pacing is great, the characters were likeable, and the plot made sense. It is set up to have sequel appeal, but it doesn't end on an irritating cliffhanger, which I really appreciated. At times it was downright funny. Even though some of the plot points sound darker ( dead mom, some guy trying to harm the main character ) it never felt dark. It was so lighthearted, I found myself laughing several times ( but not in that annoying yeah right kind of way. ) \n Yes, it was cutesy. Yes, it was insta- love. Yes it was YA mixed with a bit of sexy NA adult mixed with fantasy. And yes it was highly entertaining."}

{"text": "See full review for The Iron Traitor at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n Ethan and Kenzie are back from the Nevernever and things are about to go down. Kenzie's father, who didn't pay much attention to her before, is paying attention now especially when because of her antics - their excuse of running away to New York - she ends up back in the hospital. Kenzie's father forbids Ethan from seeing his daughter ever again and threatens to make his life hell if he even attempts to do so. Kenzie and Ethan don't listen, of course, but another kink is thrown into their plans when Meghan shows up at Ethan's house and asks if he has seen Keirran. Apparently he is missing and no one can find him. \n Ethan doesn't think much of it until Annwyl - the banished Summer Court faery - shows up and admits that the reason Keirran is missing is because he is out looking for a cure for her because she has started to Fade. She needs to find him before it is too late and Ethan grudgingly agrees to help her. But there is a mysterious fey - other than the Forgotten - lurking around who wants to set the balance right. Not to mention a prophecy that just might be the key as to why Meghan has stayed away for so long. \n So when I reviewed The Lost Prince over twelve months ago, in my final rating I wished that the next book would be better because Ethan drove me nuts with his constant complaining. I got my wish. Ethan keeps his complaining to a minimum. The book was so action packed that I couldn't put it down - seriously I stayed up until almost two in the morning on another work day because I needed to finish it."}
{"text": "I'm not one to complain about novels (okay I am but I thought I'd start out nice) but this novel was horrible in all sense of the word. \n First off there was the never ending sentences. If a sentence takes up 7 lines in a book you HAVE to add a period somewhere. The constant run on sentences and long sentences made me feel slightly overwhelmed. Not to mention the fact that I felt like I was sorta reading one of those novels a novice writer sends me. \n The second horrible thing about this was the plot. I say that loosely because I think there was a plot but it got overshadowed by the overly long sentences. \n I had such high hopes for this novel and yet they were destroyed."}
{"text": "This review was written for Joyfully Jay Reviews and can be accessed here: http://joyfullyjay.com/2016/12/review... \n 4.5 Stars. \n Crown Prince Brier Snow is a nineteen-year-old shut-in, barricaded within his own castle under the guardianship of his stepmother, the Queen. He's not used to being near anyone but his beloved nursemaid, and is unhappy that the Queen is sending him to Aire, a region of his land that's populated by criminal exiles and dishonored Thenians. Roland, a huntsman and former Thenian lord, is tapped to be Brier's Master for a year, to teach him to be a warrior. Brier knows his \"sabbatical\" is nothing but the latest attempt to shame him, yet he stoically rises to the challenge. \n During the course of the next months of travel, hunting, and training, Roland and Brier develop a mutual regard. Roland thought the prince haughty, like all Aurelians. But, he learns Brier's hesitance was insecurity, not arrogance. Brier's training is aided by six of Roland's comrades, who mostly take to Brier as well. Brier's affection is greater than as student for his teacher, however, and he makes it clear that he has grown to love Roland, even if Roland will never accept him. Roland's got a secret, however, about his training--that Brier was never meant to survive. \n I think readers will quickly catch on that this is a take on (Brier) Snow White and the Seven (Thenians) Dwarves. It's not much like the tale, excepting Brier is widely regarded as exceptionally fair and the huntsman being too smitten with the Prince to kill him. Just as Roland and Brier acknowledge their love, Brier's fetched back to his castle and coronation. Not like a King could keep an outcast twenty-plus years his senior as consort, Roland thinks, but neither man is happy apart. Brier's melancholy is compounded by his remarkable physiology. He'd been sequestered for years and hidden his \"scars,\" a slivery pattern of leaves that grow over his alabaster skin. These markings are not common, but three men of Brier's lineage have exhibited them in the past few hundred years. And, those men seemingly became pregnant. Like Brier. Can he bear raising Roland's child alone? He has a suitor at court, a young, beautiful prince from a friendly nation, who wants to be his consort. It would make surviving in his unstable court easier to allow this man to take credit for Roland's bastard, but Brier's heart is pledged. And Roland returns, taking a position as King's Guard, since his rightful place as consort is unlikely to be accepted by the nobles who find Thenians completely unsavory. \n This fantastical epic is bittersweet. Both Brier and Roland have had lonely lives, and Roland has a mountain of regrets. He feels responsible for the subjugation of his people, for the death of his wife and unborn child, for his brother, for accepting a contract on Brier's life. He's a man of honor who's lost everything more than once, and he loses Brier more than once, too. His inability to trust Brier's love leads to his disgrace, yet again. \n I really liked the story. It had great elements of fantasy that were fully integrated into this tale of love and political intrigue. The mpreg business was described well, with real-life stakes that were heart-tugging at times. Brier's a good man, and he learns to be a great leader. He has a fractured nation, and a scheming stepmother, and courtiers who are unhappy with the positive social justice changes he's making. He's vulnerable in many ways, but he makes decisions that keep him in the people's favor, even winning over the Thenians--eventually. Expect there to be giant obstacles to overcome, for both Brier and Roland, and for there to be long separations, too. Roland does make the right choices in the end, and he saves Brier's life on many occasions. But, can he rescue Brier's shattered heart and restore his family? \n It took me just a bit to get the hang of all the speech changes, as Brier learns to speak Roland's native tongue. It was handy that there's a glossary in the very beginning. It set the mood for exploration and open-mindedness for the reader. The imaginary setting was crafted with care, but I struggled with timing just a little. Some of the time frames seemed conveniently long or short, and this varied inexplicably in parts. That said, I didn't feel short-changed on the world building or the culture-building, and felt very much transported into Brier's world. \n The Epilogue was so spectacular I want another book. Now. I think people who like fantasy, and are willing to give license to the Snow White fairytale, would really enjoy this one. It was also kind of sweet to watch Brier and Roland in parental roles. The characters are compelling, and the story doesn't bog, much, having a span of more than two years from beginning to end--add a whole lot more for the Epilogue. There's no doubt that the end is happy."}

{"text": "Since the start of 2014 I've been completely addicted to the HBO-series Game of Thrones. I binge-watched the first three seasons and when the forth came out I loyally watched each week. I knew I would want to read the books (definitely cause waiting for the next season takes so long...) so I started collecting them. Standing on my shelf, they kind of frightened me: these huge books, filled with complicated names and complex story lines. It turns out, that was completely unnecessary: the first book got me hooked and I finished it in just over two weeks. If it wasn't for all the other books I want to read, I would be reading the second one already. \n \"Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. Armour yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you.\" \n Because I've seen the tv-series, this book wasn't as complicated as I expected. Most names I recognized and the map in the front of the book definitely gives a good image of the world. I think that when you haven't seen the tv-series though, it's hard to keep up with all the different story-lines and perspectives. Also, as a person who watched the tv-series: the book is very much alike (well actually, it's the other way around, but you know what I mean). This book is 768 pages long and almost everything that happens, is put in the tv-series. This didn't make the book any less exciting for me; at some times I almost wanted to skip lines just to get trough the tension (for example with Arya, Joffrey and Sansa at the river). \n \"When you play a game of thrones you win or you die.\" \n The world created in this book is amazing. The characters are awesome. My favorites definitely are Daenerys Targaryen (I even have a Funko figurine of her), Khal Drogo, Arya and Tyrion. Daenerys is by far at the top because she is so extremely bad-ass. Even though I want to read some other books before starting the second, I can hardly contain myself. I just hear A Clash of Kings calling my name."}
{"text": "The Siren is one of those books that I feel conflicted about when it comes time to review. There were good things about the book - fast pace, an interesting concept, and a fairly interesting character (The Ocean) - but there were so many things that just didn't work for me - insta-love, lack of character development, mopey teenagers - that I walked away feeling disappointed. This book could have been so much more than what it was. \n In the acknowledgements of the book, Kiera Cass makes a pretty bold statement that 90% of her readership is teenage females. It is very clear that The Siren was written to cater in every way, shape and form to this audience. The characters for the most part are surprisingly one dimensional, the plot is pushed to the back in place of longing/pining for a man the girl hardly met/interacted with, and there feels as if there isn't really any substance to the book. \n That is with the exception of The Ocean (a character in the book with feelings and a personality). The Ocean was the best part of the novel by far. \n The way it is written isn't a bad thing, if that is the type of book you are looking for, but I feel as if the majority of the readers - even those that are within the 90% teenage female group - will want a little bit more. \n I will start with the insta-love. The novel is a standalone that comes in at 327 pages. So, I understand that readers aren't going to have a whole lot of time to see the romance blossom and bloom, but that doesn't mean a romance has to instantly happen and the characters become soulmates forever. \n Kahlen meets Akinli in a school library. They have a very brief interaction that totals maybe 5 minutes. This is followed by another short encounter in the school quad a few days later and a date that lasted maximum of an hour. After all this, Kahlen is madly in love with Akinli. This might work if the two characters interacted more with each other afterwards, but they don't for almost the entire half of the book. \n After their first date, Kahlen runs away from Akinli and moves to another part of the country because their romance cannot happen. The chapters after this are filled with Kahlen wondering 'what if', 'why this', and creating this entire fantasy in her head until she is convinced she would have married Akinli and rode off into the sunset. It just wasn't believable, especially when Kahlen is an 18-year old siren who has lived for 80 years. \n The instant attraction between the two mixed with their lack of any interactions - there is another date later in the book before the ending made it extremely difficult for me to buy into this romance. I can suspend reality a little bit, but this just seemed too unbelievable for me. Unfortunately, as a result the novel felt flat and the plot/romance felt forced. I felt no emotions for the couple which made the ending difficult to believe. \n Another aspect of the novel which didn't really work for me was the character development. All of the characters, which the exception of The Ocean, felt one dimensional. Kahlen was this sulky, sullen character who didn't like to hang out, didn't like to do anything. Pretty much, she sat around moping about her situation in life and then playing a fantasy in her head about a guy. \n And her friends were no better. Her friends lacked empathy for anyone but themselves. Forced people to engage in activities they were uncomfortable with and looked down on anyone who was different or didn't do things (casual one night stands, underage drinking) that they would consider normal. \n There is one thing that nagged at the back of my mind while reading the book. Where did the girls get the money they used to move around? They moved around and lived in vacation homes on the beach (with convenient beach access). One of the characters sold paintings, but that didn't account for how they could just toss cash around and move to Italy, Miami, and other beachfront areas. \n There is one redeeming quality to the book - The Ocean. I loved this aspect of the novel. The Ocean at first was a little confusing. I wasn't sure what to make of her, as she had her own thoughts and feelings and personality. As the story unfolded, I really came to like The Ocean even though she wasn't a very likeable character. She was possessive and mean at times. If it hadn't been for The Ocean, I would have abandoned the book. It really gives it a nice twist and makes the story somewhat bearable. \n Do you walk away feeling satisfied at the end of the novel? Yes and no. Everything is wrapped up nicely and complete, but there is an overwhelming sense of emptiness and disappointment. It is almost like you wanted more, but didn't get it. \n I, personally, feel The Siren felt like it had potential, but the need to make it standalone was its downfall. There were so many things that could have happened or aspects that could have developed, but weren't. \n The Siren is a mix of The Little Mermaid and some mega teen drama complete with insta-love galore and major pouting/sulking. For the right reader - one who can overlook major plot issues and who doesn't really want a whole lot of depth to their story - this is a good book. Unfortunately, for the average reader this may leave them feeling a bit disappointed. \n ************************************** \n Disappointing. Longer review later. It gets 2 stars only because of the last 50 pages."}

The reader, myself at least, only begins to like Alys when she starts taking matters into her own hands and becomes will to risk her life for others. \n I'm wavering between giving Dragon's Bait three-and-a-half and four stars.

{"text": "The Glass Sentence is a YA fantasy that has a little bit of everything thrown into it. There is some mention about magic, a huge emphasis on science and scientific facts, a quest, and some alternative history thrown into it. \n The novel, which is the first book of a series, is very reminiscent of His Dark Materials. That isn't to say it's a carbon copy of it or the ideas are the same, but there is a distinct similarity in writing style, plotline, and even characters. Fans of this series will be sure to enjoy The Glass Sentence, as well as any following novels. \n The entire novel revolves around the concept that at one point the world was as we knew it and then suddenly this huge disruption happened. Think, apocalypse, but not really. This disruption caused the entire globe to slip into different time periods. Some areas went back in time, some went forward, but they all co-exist at once. \n The Glass Sentence by no means would be classified as a 'fast read'. It starts off with a very slow, almost sluggish start. This is because there is a lot of background information, scientific facts, and world building that needs to happen in order for readers to understand the series. Unfortunately, this takes time and results in a sluggish, slow-moving feel. \n If you can make it through the sluggish/slowness in the beginning of the novel, there is a decent, well-rounded novel. Sadly, most readers will probably give up on the novel, which leads people to miss out on a unique story. \n I would estimate that a good one-third, to one-half of the novel is sluggish world building. There is a lot of time spent explaining the rather complex 'new world' that people are living in. There is time spent explaining how maps are made, the different types of maps, and even the extensive history/culture/customs of the different eras. \n In addition to the sluggish nature of the book, I (personally) found it difficult to suspend disbelief on the whole concept of different eras/time periods/time co-existing in a world. I am not totally sure if it was too scientific for my brain to process or if I just couldn't let go of the world that I know, but I just couldn't envision it happening. \n While I was able to get through The Glass Sentence and found the story/plot alright, I believe my inability to suspend disbelief for the story hindered/hurt my experience with this book. I can see how much potential this series has and I realize that for the right reader this is 'the book' to read, I just found it difficult. It wasn't until the very end that things started to 'click' for me and I really started enjoying the book. \n Would I recommend The Glass Sentence to everyone? Probably not. There is a certain audience that will really enjoy/love this book. Fans of His Dark Materials, those looking for a unique novel that is not the normal 'YA' read, and those that like complex world building. If you are going to read this book, make sure to give it time as it really does take a while to build up - and of course - be prepared for a huge cliffhanger!"}

{"text": "FULL REVIEW POSTED!!! \n 5+ 'Will Love You Beyond Death' Stars \n \"You're my life, little girl. You die, I die with you.\" \n Wow, I'm having a serious book hangover and character withdrawal. I'm missing these character already hard - ok Dorian that is. I was waiting over a year to read the big finale of this kickass paranormal serial and now I'm sitting here, not knowing what to read/do next. Man, what a crazy ride this book was. \n We all know S.L. Jennings can write, oh boy can she write, but her paranormal serial is off the charts AWESOME! In this highly anticipate conclusion she went all out. She packed it with love (love that bordered on insanity), action, heartache, loss, grieve, growth, surprises.... dang, just everything. It made me feel; her characters and story made me feel in all the right and wrong places, and sometimes I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. \n \"...Gabs - not even death would keep him from you. That's the kind of love that people spend a lifetime searching for - the kind wars are fought for. It can't even really be described as love anymore. It's insanity of the heart.\" \n Oh how right Morgan was. Dorian and Gab's love is like them, otherworldly, and goes beyond anything and anyone. It's been one year since she saw him in this nightclub, one year that he turned not just her world but also her heart upside down. Everything Dorian does, he does it with intensity - loving Gabs is one of it. In this year both encountered some series stuff thanks to Dorian's father, the King and the she-bitch who shall not be named. Now that Gabriella ascended and is the Dark Light (the Divine's golden child) , accepting both parts of her bloodline, the King tries his hardest to make Gabs align with him, even if this means he has to kill every single one of Gabs loved ones....oh and don't think he wouldn't do just about that.. \n Jennings perfectly captured not only the main characters personality growth and struggles, but also her feelings in the book. The reader gets to know Dorian, the real Dorian on such a deeper level that we can' help but fall even more for him. I was a goner ladies, no kidding. He's like the hottest dark Prince ever - and Jennings' steamy scenes were so smokin' hot that I had to take several loooong breaths to calm the f down. Dang she can write a hot scene that makes me green with envy; lucky Gabs! \n The details in the book is another thing I adored. Jennings created a whole different world with different magical creatures and their caste system living among humans. \n A dull moment? Nope, you won't find in this book. \n I really have nothing to complain about; I absolutely loved every page. \n It's not that she didn't freak me out - she did big times. But she also made me tear up and utterly sad - but I've to admit it was for the better (you'll know why when you read it). Yes, we'll experience many losses so do it like me, have a bottle of wine ready. \n If you're looking for a steamy, intriguing new paranormal serial than I highly recommend those books. It's one of my all time favorite serials because it's packed with everything I'm looking for in a PNR book - sex, love, and magic. Characters to fall head over heels in love with. \n \"I know what true suffering is, Gabriella. And no degree of agony could ever surmount how it feels to not have you by my side.\" \n DARK LIGHT (#1) --> http://amzn.to/TATcJJ \n THE DARK PRINCE (#2) --> http://amzn.to/TN8AD5 \n NIKOLAI (#2.5 Novella) --> http://amzn.to/TN8Jqm \n ___________________________________ \n Read all my review (A-Z) on the blog \n Like the blog on Facebook \n Email subscription to my blog"}

To be honest though...I truly look forward to reading the next...so with that said...on to the next..."}
{"text": "This is a fun book if you can ignore the author's political partisanship. The writing is a bit ham-handed, but the plot is very fun. It continues the story of Bean and actually succeeds in making him an interesting, if too \"Saintly\" character. \n The one thing he gets wrong is that in his universe, reasoned, useful debate takes place on the internet."}
{"text": "This was very pretty, but given that I was incapable of reading the dialogue in anything other than the voices from the movie, I have no idea how it might stand on its own. It kept throwing me that Molly was so young when all of the other characters looked so similar to their movie designs. \n I will add that I thought it was an excellent book adaptation: while there were some descriptive passages lifted verbatim from the book that ran alongside the images they were describing, these tended to complement and highlight each other rather than being redundant."}
{"text": "I loved this book!!! It had been such a long time since I read a book that I didn't just think was \"ok\" but \"amazing\"; this was it. This book has love, magic, mystery, and even history. It was easy to get attached to the characters and fall in love along with Mathew and Diana. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy and a good love story.."}

{"text": "I liked this book, it was pretty dark, and the end was almost too much, even for ME."}
{"text": "The first five chapters just horrified me. I couldn't go through a minute without thinking 'WTF Is she going to do now!?' at least once. Anneliese (Drew) is supposed to be this incredibly smart girl and apparently it only counts academically. Common sense must not be considered as that important, which I felt was sad. Drew needed it. It's commonsense not to drive off into a so-called Paradise with a stranger next to you whom you barely know. No matter how hot he is. Honestly, it made me feel like Ronan was taking her off to join a cult or be gang-raped. He was acting really shady. \n The rest of the characters were okay. I didn't feel any real connection or believe that I can try to relate to them. Most of the characters didn't have any real depth to them. Yasou was good, though. \n It got better when I reached halfway. I felt like there was a real plot there. But it was a really simple plot that could be explained in a few paragraphs which is sad because it had small potential. \n Altogether, two stars which only awarded mainly because of the fight scenes because I think that they were written very nicely and Yasou."}
{"text": "I tried to like this book, but I finally had to give up at the halfway point (at about page 150). The writing is extremely simplistic, the plot - confusing and not fleshed out, and the characters one dimentional. \n There were so many questions I had within the first few pages. The children - who are orphans of sorts - are being bullied. The whole school including all the staff know about it, yet encourage it to happen. \n After school the kids learn of this tournament for a video game. Their aunt tells them they can't go, so they sneak out while she is sleeping. Okay what children's tournament is held at night, while all the parents are sleeping? Jump forward and the kid wins the tournament and is wisked away to some mystery house. Yet no one goes 'ummm maybe we should tell our aunt where we are going?'. Nope, they just ignore it. \n The kids play this virtual avatar game, but the author tends to blur when its is real and when it isn't. Sometimes the kids are playing it, but all of a sudden they are in the game. So, is this virtual reality or magic or what? It was very confusing. \n This combined with the seemingly pointless comparisons (my mind is racing like a billion browser windows open) or the not-so-funny fart jokes made me have to stop reading. I just couldn't take it any longer."}
{"text": "This is my second go around reading this novel. I read it 7 years ago and it was one of my first fantasy novels. I revisted it again this summer and it still shows me that I love me some Terry Brooks fantasy. \n I wouldn't say this is his strongest or best book, but it fits with the series and fills in some gaps. I love it, but not my favorite Shannara novel."}
{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n There's a fantastic story in here. Unfortunately, it's lost under a flood of awkward writing: Angelique's family dramas are only roughly sketched in, Drew's reasons for simultaneously despairing and going through the motions of curse-breaking are never explored, the magic that surrounds Drew's castle suffers from a near-complete lack of world-building, and, sadly, the contortions that the narrative voices go through to mostly avoid using pronouns for Drew are tremendously irritating and not at all mysterious, partly because the reader knows right from the beginning that Drew's \"secret\" is that she's a woman but mostly because it's so clumsily done that it makes nongendered language into a torturous ordeal of sentence fragments and epithets, which I certainly hope was not the intended message! \n On Angelique's family, I feel as though her father could have been drawn in much subtler strokes, with more emphasis on how betrayed he feels by the \"weak\" people around him and less explicit emphasis on his own weaknesses and greed -- far less is needed, since the entire structure of the story rests on the weakness of the father and since the changes for this interpretation nicely highlight that weakness as greed. (When he dies and no one cares, there should be at least a little pathos!) Angelique's brothers are almost complete ciphers, and Angelique's mother's family gets throwaway lines that are very nearly the only characterization anyone in that family has. \n The flashback scene that should have been the heart of Drew's story is barely two pages long, and it's only clear that it is a flashback and not a verbal recounting by the pronoun changes and the lack of quotation marks -- neither of which, I'm sad to say, the editing to that point primed me to read as deliberate rather than accidental -- and, for a searingly traumatic experience, it's almost completely lacking in tension or richness of description. (\"Noooo!!! [sic]\" is not, young padawan knights aside, dramatic.) \n So, all right, we have young Drew, twenty-one years old and raised in glorious isolation by her father to believe that she'll grow up to be Count and marry a nice young girl; we have conniving witchy step-mother who preps Drew's father and then sets up Drew to be disinherited and cast out; we have, again, terribly naive young Drew all alone in this world, believing her family who says she's a monster. Drew spends around fifty years wallowing in a broken heart and severely bruised pride and then at least a hundred more theoretically trying to break the curse but actually setting herself up to be rejected over and over again, thereby proving that her family was right and she was wrong. Great backstory, right? And yet, no. It's astoundingly dull, multiple exclamation points aside. \n The curse is never very well drawn, since it seems to consist mostly of saying that Drew will be twenty-one and stuck in a valley on the borders of fairyland until she gets married, but it only takes a little bit of clever wording for Drew to go charging off to Angelique's rescue after all. (Also, fairyland? Well-used to set the scene; completely irrelevant to all of the plot. There was practically an entire cutlery set on the mantelpiece in the first act in order to draw a knife in the third, if you'll allow a cliche. Why are the Old Ones serving Drew? What's the point of the snakes? What are the poachers looking for? Why is Angelique learning magic? We'll never know!) The corresponding curse on the wicked step-mother came completely out of left field; I'm not sure if there were hints of it that I just missed, but with a little more build-up and a little less what-the-heck-just-happened-there the whole setting up for the revenge killing could have been a great ending. As it is, of course you know that Drew's going to shrug and walk out -- the dramatic rescue has already been completed at this point -- but she stands there listening to the step-mother rant for two pages first, probably with the same what-the-heck-crazy-lady look on her face that I had reading it. \n I really like what this story could have been, though. It's definitely a fairy-tale retelling with far more to the story than just a clever concept (lesbian Beauty and the Beast!). I'm almost tempted to give it three stars. \n (Also? The illustrations in this edition are...well, okay, the little roses are cute and the silhouettes are incomprehensible but still somewhat cute. I think it might be the ridiculously typeset captions on the silhouette illustrations that crack me up: they use some retro-eighties pixelated font that is either a severe typesetting error or some artistic choice which I am completely incapable of understanding. This may be a metaphor for the entire book, actually.)"}
{"text": "Young Warriors is an excellent collection of fifteen original short stories by some of the best authors in the young adult genre. I've read more than a few books by Tamora Pierce who both edited and contributed to this volume. The theme of the book deals with children and teens who have to find their inner warrior. The stories are set in a wide variety of countries, cultures and time periods. No two are alike. The skill and originality displayed by these writers took my breath away. I will be looking for other books written by the authors of Young Warriors."}

{"text": "Meira wants to be a soldier. She wants to fight for her people, that are being oppressed and have become mostly slaves. And she wants to protect her best friend, the heir to the throne and the guy she's in love with, even if they can't be together. But it seems the only way she can help is to be sold as a bride, so they can have an army to fight against the Spring Kingdom. She's part of the 8 people that escaped from slavery, and its up to them to free the people of the Kingdom of Winter. \n I enjoyed this book a lot. It reminded me a bit of Finnikin of the Rock, which I loved; but that also meant that it became predictable. \n I really like the main character, she's strong and smart. I just think the world is a bit simple, and I think the \"big revelation\" is way too predictable, so that was disappointing. I don't know if it is because I've read similar books or if the author gives too many hints, but since the way the beginning it was pretty clear. Fortunately, I loved the world and the characters, and the story is strong, so I wanted to keep reading. \n There is a love triangle, but it wasn't the main aspect of the book. Personally I liked Theron more. I think Mather is a bit too stiff and also, Theron thinks of her more, and respects her. Its not that Mather is a bad guy, and I liked him at first, but after he sold Meira, even if he wanted to \"fix it\", It just wasn't the same. \n I can't wait to read the second book!"}

{"text": "2.5 stars \n This was one bizarre book. I was shocked at the end to realise that it was written by the same person who'd written the Lux series I'd spent the weekend obsessing about - I would have never guessed that, the writing is completely different. (Although thinking about it, lots of discussion of eye colour and abs should have alerted me to this). Lux felt finished whereas this book - felt like it was a draft. Or at least, certainly the first half felt like it was a draft, and yes, it is incredibly similar to Vampire Academy although I'd argue that it isn't *as* similar. For example, Deacon/Seth clearly suck, whereas Adrian kicks ass, so let's not visit that one again. *fangirl moment* \n It was very easy to get through, I almost read it completely in my two-way train commute and then had about 5% to finish at home. It lacked description, although thinking about it, the Lux books were similar. I can tell you a lot of the characters had hair as they were constantly putting their hands through it, and I know what colour eyes people had, but I'm less sure about anything else. \n The story.... yes, it is very similar to VA but there are some bits that are different. I just wish some of the characters were a bit more likeable. The reason VA was so good was because you could see Rose being with Dmitri and Adrian - both were good for her, but whereas Aidan clearly is a sweetheart, Seth seems so creepy. Maybe that's the intention, but it doesn't sell it either way to me. Either make him completely venomous or nice, you can't have it in the middle - it's just....turgid. \n I'm going to try the next book at some point to see if it does deviate from VA, as the author says it does, but I'm more looking forward to the next Lux book, truth be told."}

Also, don't be turned off by this being the first volume in a series: it's a standalone novel with a clear and conclusive ending, so no large-scale buy-in required :).

A mother's perspective, I suppose.) \n A tale of complete fantasy that's simple and fun and sweet. I'm looking forward to reading this to my own kids someday. \n I would probably give this four stars as an adult, but I remember being so enchanted with this story as a child that I have to keep my rating at five."}
{"text": "*revised* \n Thebooknatics.blogspot.com \n I almost don't even know where to begin with this review...Wow. This book was beyond awesome, it absolutely blew me away. And for being a YA Novel, this story exceeds my standards for all YA Paranormal, which definitely raised the bar. This story is far from your cliche paranormal YA. There is a certain scene you'll come to, though, which has a sliver of similarity and most likely inspired from Hunger Games, but with a twist. But all in all, Elle Casey certainly has a charming way with storytelling, giving us a full action-packed scenes, and vivid, dynamic characters. I am totally in love! Each character introduced to us has superb depth which gives readers a chance to relate and attach. \n Though classified as a YA novel, Casey has a way of creatively adding swear words in a not-so-obnoxious way of over-using, but in such hilarious, comical ways. \n And though I wouldn't call this a Paranormal Romance, there is a hint of potential first-love bonding, so beautifully written, where our heroine struggles to admit she has \"sappy\" feelings. \n This book starts off as two normal highs-schoolers in central Florida, Jayne, a crass, potty mouthed teenager and her dorky friend Tony she picked on for years, but secretly cares for him more than she does for anyone else in the world. When both start having trouble at home, Tony takes everyone by surprise causes a scene to rescue Jane from family drama and run away together. They soon find themselves amongst other teenage runaways led by an older teen, named Jared. One day, Jared returns to their hideout with an ad for a \"Fitness Interview\" each person selected will receive $500 at the end of the job. Must be 18 years or older to participate. Well, obviously they lie, but what's to lose at this point? The strange interview is completed and all but one runaway are selected to go. The adventure begins when the kids are on the plane to their destination for the 'job' and are offered a drink. Jayne who was suspicious ever since the interview, (she's the hard-@ss of all the kids) watched her friends plop down in their seats next to her. Needless to say, she did not go down without a fight, she kicked and swung punches till she was hit with a tranquilizer, and even as she went down, she still told them where to shove it. Comical. \n When the children awake, they are no longer in a plane, but in a cottage... and standing there greeting them is... a Dwarf in combat. Jayne began to believe she was seriously drugged or she was finally losing her mind. They find themselves in the middle of a Fae War...and they are the contestants... Each child learns they obtain a personal ability. Jayne is the most hilarious upon finding hers. If you want an idea of this enchanted forest puts obstacles in their way, I can tell you it's like a mystical, fae-like Hunger Games, just more deadly, mysterious and scary. \n I could go on forever about this book, but then what would be the point in reading if I were to do that? This is a must read! I can't emphasize it enough, I can almost guarantee if you love hilarious, Fantasy/Paranormal novels with a smart and feisty heroine who has a strong head on her shoulders, with Elle Casey is a YA/Paranormal GENIUS! I want to get my hands on some hard copies of this series for my collection. They will be going straight to my top shelf at home!"}
{"text": "I received an electronic copy of this book by the author for an honest review. \n I liked this book. It is fast paced, and it got me hooked. Most things were a bit predictable, but the story wasn't about some big revelations, it was a simple and straight forward story. \n I would have wanted the pace to be a bit slower. I wanted to get to know the characters, to learn about them and see them interact more. The love also felt a bit rushed. \n I enjoyed the world, and would love to get to see more tribes in Animalia. \n I hope in the next book we get to know Kora, because I didn't really understand the origin of her feelings. \n Overall, I enjoyed it and would keep reading the series."}

{"text": "Imagine a mixing bowl in which you throw in X-Men mutants, a Game of Thrones cut-throat political scene, and a Hunger Games dystopian setting. What would you get? The answer to that would be the fast paced, addictive YA novel, Red Queen by Victoria Aveyard. \n Red Queen tells the tale of a Mare, a 17-year-old Red girl who lives in the poor section of the country. She has resigned herself to the fact that her future isn't that bright and in just a few months she will be shipped off to serve her required time in the army. After all, she is just a red and not a silver - which is an elite warrior with god-like powers. All was going as planned, until a chance encounter with an individual winds up changing her life. \n One morning, she is unexpectedly summoned to start a new job in the Silver Palace where she serves the elite members of society - and those individuals whom she has hated her entire life. It is while working in the Silver Palace that she discovers a secret that may change everything. She appears to have the powers of a silver, but still bleeds like a red. This could be what is needed to change society, but the silvers will do everything in their power to keep this secret hidden. \n If you are thinking to yourself, 'wow all of this sounds familiar', that is because in many ways it has been done. And this pains me to say - but Red Queen is just one of the many novels of this genre. \n Red Queen is pretty much your run-of-the-mill YA supernatural/dystopian romance fantasy. It has the oppressive society, the downtrodden young woman who finds herself a pivotal member of society, and of course romance - lots and lots of romance. It is well-written, fast paced, but sadly it is predictable in many aspects. It just didn't have a lot to set it apart from the dozens of other books in the genre. \n I do want to note that if you are looking for a lot of magic/supernatural aspect to the novel, it really is more of an undertone and foreshadowing for future books. This first novel is mainly focused on Mare working her way through the political courts, discovering what she can do, and establishing the world/situation. \n There is also a lot of time spent on the romance - love triangle of sorts. While it is necessary, it can give some readers a sense of false hope as it feels like a romance novel disguised as a supernatural/fantasy book. \n I'm conflicted because it is very clear Victoria Aveyard is a strong, passionate writer with major talent, but the cardboard cutout feel of the book just made it difficult to really love, love the book. It is the first book of a trilogy, so there is plenty of room left for Aveyard to spread her wings show her talent and really shine. \n Now, if you are a fan of this genre (liked books like The Selection and Throne of Glass), I think you will ultimately love this novel. If this is your first introduction to this genre, you'll love it. However, if you are looking for something new and different, this first book just doesn't have that. \n Overall, Red Queen was a well-written, fast paced novel, but it just didn't have enough of a twist to set it apart from the other novels of this genre. I will certainly be reading the second book of the series to see where it goes. I, ultimately, hope some of the predictable nature disappears and the series turns out to be amazing."}

But that's not all they are. It turns out that their parents were also magically gifted and cashed in on their gifts by hosting a television show. When their parents died, Dee took her sisters and went into hiding. She has the assumption that her aunt Xan killed her parents for their powers and is coming after Dee and her sisters for theirs. She's right, and Xan will stop at nothing to get them. The problem is, she already knows where the sisters are, and she has been watching them for a while. She knows that they are close to giving up their powers anyway, they just need a push in the right direction. Hence, she casts a True Love spell that brings the sisters' true loves to town. The catch is that these True Loves can't stand magic and the only way the sisters can be with them is if they give up their powers. Easy, right? \n Wrong."}
{"text": "After meeting the author of The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer at the Book Blogger Convention in May, I had an immediate strong urge to read the book. Michelle Hodkin is nice, personable, and, most importantly, very secret about the contents of her book, which naturally gets a person very interested. \n Simon and Schuster were kind enough to bring many copies of this book to the convention, so I was able to walk away with one with immediate intention to read it - and I did. And I loved it. \n The writing style of Michelle flows so naturally, from scene to scene. You're inside the head of Mara Dyer throughout the entire book, which is refreshing as many books I've read lately are from multiple perspectives. I immediately latched on to Mara and her thoughts, and desperately wanted to know what was going on - which kept me reading well into the night. \n I'm not one to spoil anything, and I'm not going to start now because I believe it would take away from the book. Going in with a clean slate will give you the same experience I had (so, seriously, don't go looking for a place to spoil things for yourself). The mystery and the romance had my emotions running amuck, and I want you to discover things as Mara does (which is how the author intended you to). \n There isn't much moreip I can say without ruining parts of the book, but I do want to make it clear that this is an excellent read. The cover has drawn many people in, and the content is even better. It's a wonderful review, and if you have the chance to meet Michelle Hodkin, I would highly encourage you to - she is awesome. Loved this book."}
{"text": "As always superb imagery! I have to say so far I like TID much more than TMI. Although the triangle between Tessa, Jem, and Will? Necessary, I think not. I absolutely adore Tessa, she doesn't take crap from anybody at all, no matter what. Very refreshing."}
{"text": "This was one of the most awesome books I've read this year. The author has provided the readers with an extremely creative way how to introduce them to the world - have a protagonist who has lost her memories and is now trying to figure out the world surrounding her \"old\" self by reading the instructions left by her former self. It was extremely interesting to explore the supernatural world through this manner and how the old and new Myfawny was so different and yet so similar in some ways. \n Furthermore Myfanwy is one of my favourite heroines ever. She is downright hilarious at several points of the plot and it's hard not to like her. I mean, who would fret about mints on your pillow and Toblerone when your life is being threatened and most of the time you're just winging it?"}

I don't know how many times I read \"Now Dear Reader\" but it was enough to make me scream when I saw it. \n Other than that small problem it was a nice plot, good characters and cute jokes. I guess we can't get everything we want in books."}

{"text": "I have mixed feelings about this novel. As an adult I found it hard to get into and accept, yet I finished it. I kept wishing that a book like this existed when I was a teenage boy. Nothing like it did. I am happy that now a book about a gay superhero does exists - a superhero who has coming-of-age experiences that most gay teenager can identify with (except for the superhero part). I would give the novel five stars if I were still a teenage boy."}
{"text": "Sometimes when I have the time to sit back and relax, I love to explore Amazon for Kindle freebies, and most often cases run into little gems like this. I was amazed to see there were not many reviews for this fascinating bewitched tale. I think what caught my attention at first was the cover. My first though when looking at it, I thought, \"Man, she looks a lot like Elena from Vampire Diaries.\" Also how lovely yet simple the cover is, perfectly depicts the title. \n So getting into the first chapter of the book, you learn that our Heroine is indeed named Elena. She's a well put together, young and intelligent private investigator and works with missing person cases. She's approached by a mother and is set on an investigation to find her missing teenage daughter. Little did Elena know, just what she was getting herself into. Solving many cases of ordinary missing person cases, Elena finds herself in a world of magic, darkness and danger when she's undercover investigating a Goth club downtown where the missing girl was known to visit. Here she meets the enigmatic Vittorio, club owner and drop-dead handsome man. \n Indescribable passion strikes them when they are near each other, and never able to control how they feel for one another. The two characters finally discover what great things they can bring to the world by being together, magic awakens in Elena. Then, things suddenly take a turn in the investigation, leaving me on the edge of my seat. These two characters together make for some steamy, fervent scenes. And per usual, I hope this vague opinion of mine will spike a bit of interest for you to get on Amazon and get this book, I hate to spoil anything drastic, and like so many other books I love, I try to be careful, because the magic this book contains is best when experiencing it on your own! \n All in all, the mystery, the paranormal, and the romance, all together make for an enthralling story. I believe if you like books such as Night Huntress, Vampires in America, and Sentinel Wars, this book will blow you away. I cannot wait to see what happens next. Thank goodness for Kindle apps, I would have never found this piece of treasure."}
{"text": "I'm really torn on how to rate this. There were way too many editing issues for me and it, frankly, ruined the book for me. I still enjoyed most of the actual story. Shayne redeems himself over and over again, I just wished that he would have stopped the jealousy games sooner. Grace is too stubborn. She wants Shane , but cannot let him gain an ounce of trust.I guess that is what thousands of years of soul hopping will do to someone. I enjoyed the banter and witty comebacks;Lea is the best at comebacks in this book! Overall, I need to rate this lower than I would for almost making me flounce."}
{"text": "Well that was a fun ride! I read this in one sitting for the #rainbowthon 2.0 and I really enjoyed it! \n I definitely feel like this was a great opening and solid setup for the rest of the trilogy; but while it was incredibly fun there was definitely no rising action or climax in the story. It was also a bit predictable (seriously, I saw that twist coming from the prologue) but I love Gwen (and her friendship with Lesley!) so much that that didn't bother me as much as it usually does. I liked figuring things out along with her. The romance (or lack thereof) was also very refreshing...although I do want to see it develop more in the next book because I want to swoon a little bit. Can you really blame me? \n I'm definitely interested in seeing where the story goes and how the time travel and stone system (?) works and the bigger role it plays in the story. Overall, I just really enjoyed this. It was a fun ride."}

{"text": "A sequel! A sequel! Look -- it's book four at last! \n I reread the first three just before picking up this one; the transition was certainly jarring and I saw a few errors in consistency, but overall this book fits in very well with the older books. \n That's good and bad, as it turns out. The main thing that drove me nuts in the earlier books, especially the first two, was people jumping to conclusions instead of talking to each other, and most of the arguments between Akki and Jakkin made me want to reach into the book and slap them both. Yes, they're teenagers, but they're teenagers who've been living together on the run for a year and who can read each others' minds. \n Also, this is the book where things with sex -- or the coyness around it -- can only be called weird. Again I say: living together for a year. In a cave. Granted, they had less need than usual to huddle for warmth, but still. These lines from the third book, A Sending of Dragons, remain the sweetest moment between the two of them in the whole series (and they aren't even together) -- \n When he really became bored with his own company and felt himself slipping back into the half-sleep, he invented imaginary dialogues with Akki. She ended every one of those conversations with a hug. He got so he could feel her arms around him, the softness of her cheek on his. \n And the surprise gay secondary characters were...strange. Also the thing -- I'm trying really hard not to give spoilers here -- the thing with Likkarn was far too pat and undermined him a lot. \n All of that aside! I really enjoyed this book. A lot of the questions thrown open at the end of A Sending of Dragons were explored here, and I was satisfied with the ending of this story because it didn't have answers. This is the story of Jakkin and Akki, not of Austar IV -- well, mostly the story of Jakkin, although Akki's role is somewhat expanded -- and its central concepts are trust and responsibility. Solving the world's problems (and giving it new ones) can be handwaved in the epilogue if the characters' stories are resolved. \n I was pleased with most of Likkarn and amused by the complications poor Doctor Henk(k)y faced, and Sssargon remains ridiculous and cute. \n I would love to see more of this world's questions explored, but I don't know if Jakkin's story can give any more than it has; what I'd really like would be other people's stories, more exploration of the consequences of the slavery laws being lifted, some coherent explanation of the mountain cave dwellers (who are bizarrely called \"trogs\" in this book with no explanation of the source of that name) and their settlements, and for someone to realize that the food economy of Austar is about to be smashed."}

{"text": "I might have enjoyed this more if it had been my first Shiloh Walker book. However, major plot points from the other books I'd read by the author distracted me. Cullen (the hero) has a presence which \"settles\" the gifted heroine (Taige) like no other person she's come across before (see Hunter's Salvation). Taige is driven to become a warrior against evil, leaving no space in her life for anything other than war (see Hunting the Hunter). In addition, Taige is constantly being distracted by dreams that include Cullen- dreams that turn out to be more than just fantasy (see Through the Veil). Added to this constant sense of deja vu is the fact that the author did a really good job of making me dislike Cullen in the early part of the book and not such a good job of redeeming him later. All told, I won't be picking up another of her books in the future."}

To the Checquy the Grafters are scary monsters. And to the Grafters the Checquy are scary monsters. And there are Odette's friends who love her, but are doing these evil things. \n So...the crystal guy is just a guy. He's a guy who doesn't understand what's happening to him, and he's scared. And he's looking for Myfanwy to help him understand himself. But they kill him because he can't control his powers. \n Deep... :)"}

{"text": "I have waited a year and half for this book. When I read Cabinet of Wonders I NEEDED this book. I have to admit now I need the next book. \n This book took readers to England and used many historical characters while having the main focus be on the \"fictional\" characters. There is every bit of fantasy and humor in this book that makes it a great read. The chapters are on the short side so before one knows it the book is over with. \n The action jumps from event to event without dragging on and on and making it seem like it will be forever before something happens. \n The characters are all very three dimensional. \n Many people say it isn't important to read Cabinet of Wonders but I disagree you have to in order to understand what is going on. There are a lot of things that happen in this book that are a result of the first and it just wouldn't make sense if you didn't read the first one. \n I LOVE the spider his brute honesty and humor is what makes me love the book even more. \n There was a bit of an odd start as the author tried to bring readers up on what happened in COW but didn't do it as smoothly as some other authors. But after the first page or so it was smooth sailings :) \n I can't wait to see what element of history and fiction Rutkoski brings to the next novel but I\"m sure it'll be great."}
{"text": "Mare Barrow does what she must to survive. If that includes stealing and lying, then no one can really blame her- for a Red (a second class citizen in the lands of Norta), little is expected and little is provided. While Mare gets by on her wits and sheer determination, she knows life is different for the privileged and gifted (in more ways than one) Silvers, the elite of society. In one shocking moment, however, Mare finds out that she has more in common with the Silvers that she suspected and that realization leads her on a journey of power, deceit and political machinations that might be more than the clever little thief can handle. Who can she trust? What is the right path for herself and her people? Everything will change when fate unveils the Red Queen. \n Red Queen has a very Hunger Games feel (battle as entertainment, communities at war, class system with a vast wasteland between levels, a girl who gets by through cunning and sticky fingers, dealing with the black market, hoping to avoid the war, desperate to protect friends and family that she doesn't fully connect with but still feels responsible for, etc). At first this made me cynical; I felt the story was entertaining enough, but still had way too much in common with Hunger Games (and thus also Divergent) to impress me. And yet I read on, getting involved in the story, into the character, sucked into the plot despite myself. By the time the Queenstrial began I was completely hooked and quite willing to give myself over to Aveyard's entrancing story. If Mare is the little sister of Katniss and Tris, she is a sibling that, despite having much in common with her sisters, still has the potential to mature and display characteristics and strengths that will set her apart from the rest of her family. I eagerly await the next segment of this anticipated trilogy to see if Mare lives up to her potential. \n side note: \n 7th grade level recommended as a result of suspenseful action and political elements. Language and relationship issues not a factor, aside from one use of the \"b\" word."}
{"text": "The books in this set are all separate works, and have no connection with one another. That said, CLAIMED BY THE MATE features FERAL PASSIONS--which precedes Wild Passions and THE ALPHA'S WOMAN which comes before Her Perfect Mates. I think they make more sense having read the previous books. \n To sum up, all the books have male shifters and human females. Catch a Tiger features a M/F romance between a tiger shifter who lives two lives--smart accountant and mob guy. Wild Passions has wolf shifters in search of their mates--mostly this is M/F but there is all a FMM menage. Her Perfect Mates is a MFM menage. \n In Catch a Tiger by the Tail by Eve Langlais, Brody finds his mate while investigating a suspected grift at one of his mafia boss' adult cabaret. Lulu was a waitress at Tail Waggers until her manager disappeared and she got \"promoted.\" Now, Lycan leader of the city Fabian Geroux thinks somebody's on the take--and his sights are on Lulu. Brody's, a lone tiger shifter, in a tight spot trying to prove the sexy redheaded human isn't scamming Fabian, because falling for a human is bad--falling for one Fabian wants dead is way, way worse. \n In the way of things, it turns out Lulu isn't who they suspect her to be, but her secrets aren't necessarily the worst. Nope, the worst is the homicidal maniac who plans to kill her in a quest for revenge against her father. Brody's a wily cat and ends up saving her from big bad bears and keeping her safe from Fabian, too. \n In Wild Passions by Kate Douglas, four women--friends closer than sisters--head off to an exclusive mountain resort for a week-long bachelorette getaway. Feral Passions is a \"wolf preserve.\" Werewolves and regular alike. In this world, all werewolves are male, and they can turn a female with whom they mate. There's a whole pack of males wishing for mates. Meg is having second thoughts about her upcoming marriage to Zach, a wealthy entrepreneur. She and Elle, Jules and Darian--best friends from childhood--are planning a sexy retreat and find the men of Feral Passions to be even hotter than the pictures on the website. Elle soon has two wolves in her bed, while Darian and Jules each pair up with a sexy man-beast. Meg, despite her cold feet, is befriended by Trak, the owner of the resort--and his companionship helps Meg to recognize that she's an attractive woman very much worthy of Zach's affection and love. Lots of sexytimes for Elle, Jules and Darian--and the men who please them. Gonna need a third book to pair off the rest of the pack, but so far everyone is totes cool with their mate-pairings. \n In Her Perfect Mates by A.C. Arthur, Malec hates being a shifter--ever since his twin killed himself. Channing never knew his parents, but his adoptive family was very kind. These two met up with Blaez years ago and they all served in a special ops group in the Marines, alongside Phelan. Now they work and live together in a highly secured compound in the mountains. The previous book was the lovestory between Blaez and his mate Kira. There's a big shifter war in their world, and they came from different factions. Blaez is a hunted shifter due to his pure werewolf lineage. Malec meets new-to-town veterinarian Caroline when he brings her a mutilated buck to see if it can be saved. Malec suspects the buck was a message from Hunter shifters after Blaez--he didn't suspect he'd find his mate at the office however. Malec's not used to being intimate with women on his own--he always makes up the third leg of a menage, with charming Channing. Thing is, Channing's also drawn to Caroline, and Caroline wants both men--except that would make her a slut, like her prostitute mother. The real and present danger forces them all close, and it seems like the only way to keep Caroline safe, from predation and gossips, is to bring her into the pack. Also, sexytimes. \n In all, I liked WILD PASSIONS best, because it's sweet and lots of sexy, but the other two are cool, and interesting in their own way. Each will have more stories to come--to resolve the major plot arcs that are still open, and also secure mates for the currently unpaired shifter males. \n I received a review copy of this book via NetGalley."}

This book was definitely a shift from the Starks being the main protagonists to there kind of being no definite main protagonist and instead having all the major characters share that role. \n The book definitely just added more story.

Only thing I didn't like is that it felt too short. Just when things started to climax, it ends. Otherwise, the story is relatable and raw. The emotions are bared out for everyone to feel right along the characters. You get sucked right in and ride the roller coaster with them. Mason and Jess are great together. I liked how there was no prolonged BS between them when they found each other. Sure it seemed rushed, but this gives more time and attention for the characters to grow and mature as the story moves along. Not sure how much I like the turn of events at the end though.

{"text": "Para terminar la saga de hush hush, nos enfrentamos a un final agridulce. La trama, aun impredecible, no se mueve ni tan lento como en el segundo libro ni tan rapido como en los otros dos, y, como de costumbre en los libros de esta autora, las vueltas de tuerca no dejan de abundar. Uno solo tendra una leve advertencia antes de que el escenario cambie por completo, su estilo personal a lo largo de toda la saga. No se puede decir, definitivamente, que trama le falte, con personajes que, como de costumbre, rozan una linea fina entre los canones establecidos y la insinuacion de una mucho mas profunda naturaleza. Me deja una sensacion cruzada, definitivamente, en un \"final feliz\" que a mi ver deja muchos cabos sueltos de tristeza y crueldad. \n Un final interesante para una saga interesante, que no creo que Becca Fitzpatrick haya pretendido conscientemente para reflejar algunas realidades de la sociedad, de las limitaciones que generan en nosotros ciertos juicios de lo que creemos que somos, de las tragedias derivadas de nuestra incapacidad para mejorar o ver las cosas desde otro punto de vista, de la triste mala memoria y facil olvido que tenemos al sacrificio, de como vivimos tratando de no pensar en el futuro inevitable. \n *CUIDADO, SPOILERS DELANTE* \n El matrimonio de Vee, cuando ella aun recuerda a Scott, cuando es obvio que huye de su recuerdo. La misma muerte de scott, a la que Nora a penas dedica unos minutos, y que olvida en cuanto encuentra a Patch, la muerte de Marcie, a la que no se dedica ni una escena incluso considerando los motivos que ella tuvo para obrar mal, el retrato perfecto de una vida vacia en una familia que la esperaba muerta en cualquier instante, bajo un padre que ni siquiera le daba valor, movida al rencor hacia nora por la infidelidad de su madre, enganada de nuevo por Nora, dejada sola hasta el final, ni siquiera consolada cuando, al igual que nuestra protagonista, intenta vengar la muerte de su padre. \n *FIN SPOILERS* \n Y sin embargo, esto a momentos se prueba delicioso, en la ironia de la suerte, en la forma en que los idiotas caen bajo el peso de su propia estupidez, en como la ignorancia impide ver los acontecimientos hasta el ultimo instante: Cuando ya son inevitables. En la forma en que los malvados gravitan estupidamente hacia su propia perdicion. \n *SPOILERS DE NUEVO* \n ?Quien destruyo realmente a Dante? ?La furia de Nora? ?Acaso no, al educarla, se destruyo el tontamente a si mismo? ?Al negar sus posibilidades, la suerte que le brindo elecciones favorables todo el tiempo, rechazadas por su propio ego? \n *FIN SPOILERS* \n Un final para quedarse pensando en una saga para quedarse pensando. Un reflejo involuntario de una sociedad que se comporta sin vision de futuro ni pasado, irremediablemente clavados al presente, de una sociedad que no escucha del todo a su corazon, sino que lo engana y lo manipula para hacerle creer que siente algo diferente, hasta el punto de creerselo ella misma. Un retrato de la absurdidad de una organizacion social que aun no ha desaparecido, de una logica social con huecos que aun es el medio en el que vivimos... \n Encerrada en una jodidamente buena trama. xDDD \n ;)"}
{"text": "In this final installment of the Aeon's Gate trilogy we journey to the island of Jaga. Death has followed, chased, and clung to our crew of adventurers, and a soujourn to Jaga won't change the fact that they are walking into the gaping maw of Ulbecetonth herself. An island surrounded by the statues of lost gods, occupied by lonely hostile warrior lizardmen, and under attack by wave after wave of longfaced purple warrior women who are only content in battle. \n So, a lot more of the same, which isn't a bad thing. Sykes picked up the gauntlet where it lay when we finished Black Halo and carried it to an almost satisfactory conclusion. Some questions remained, and Sykes has all but admitted that's because he plans on writing more stories in this universe. The questions that did remain after reading this novel were the larger picture questions, the kind that are called \"spoilers.\" \n What should returning readers look forward to? Expect to find resolution between Lenk and Kat (as much resolution as possible between a man with voices in his head and a shickt who's people are sworn to eliminate the human infection from the face of the planet). The answers you wanted for Denaos' history or Asper's hand are covered. We even get a glimpse of where the Netherlings come from. \n All in all, this third book did a great job of bringing this chapter of the story to a conclusion, while still leaving room for expansion in the future. As the conclusion of a trilogy, this book was probably the least accessible to new readers, but that's not to be unexpected in a series. I think returning readers will find that this book balances well against the first book in terms of amounts of action and pace. \n RHEGA!!!"}

{"text": "This is the first book in a new Urban Fantasy series with several gay lead characters, but romance is barely part of the story, if at all, so do not expect it. \n The Four Horsemen, Death, War, Pestilence and Famine are immortals who live on earth, hidden behind the Veil which shrouds the Fae, Darkfae and other immortals, like the Vitues: Faith Charity, Peace and Hope (among others like Gluttony, Lust and Luck...) from the sight of mortals. Except crazies and seers can sometimes see them. Kismet is likely crazy, but he's had the \"gift\" of sight since childhood. He is terrorized by his constant observations of wraiths and ghosts, including that of his younger brother who was inadvertently poisoned by their addict mother. Kismet is crippled by his visions, and self-medicates with heroin to keep the wraiths from attacking his mind. \n Kismet sits at the center of an intricate plot to remove some immortals from their Calling. See, if people need help crossing planes, Death can be summoned. If someone is in need of Hope, she must appear--and this is a tiring existence for an immortal. Some want to settle down, have a \"normal\" life, perhaps even fall in love, and Kismet's ability to see through the Veil may hint at deeper abilities. Spiking his heroin dose with an agent of magical origin kicks off the action. \n Pestilence, known as Mal to his Horsemen, is lonely. He wants a partner outside of his group, and he's too inexperienced as a Horseman to properly wield the Veil. War (Ari) yearns for more than kinship with Death, the eldest and most powerful of the Horseman. Ari is indefatigable in his pursuit, and Death welcomes his closeness, but keeps it platonic, fearing the loss of his soul if he should lose Ari, his best friend and confidante, for any reason. \n Ari and Mal encounter Kismet while on patrol, and he's in serious trouble--a powerful wraith has been summoned and is nearly finished killing him...except, Kismet survives the attack in the same fashion that an immortal might. It freaks both Mal and Ari out, and Mal insists on bringing him to Death for advice. Pretty much things get bad right after that. \n As I mentioned, this isn't a romance, though the background is set for advancement of romance in a later book. Also, this book fully resolves, while still leaving plot arcs available for a sequel, or series. Through it all we have good guys acting badly, \"bad\" guys behaving with honor, new friendships (Kismet and Mal) and deepening ties (Ari and Death). I really enjoyed the back-and-forth banter between the Horsemen, and also how committed they are to holding each other up. This book is almost exclusively told from behind the Veil, with the immortals carrying most of the POV. I did have some issue with the rapid POV shifts--this is a particular peeve of mine. I like to stay in one character's head for a scene, but the POV jumped constantly. It was less jarring than other books I've read, but still detracted from my enjoyment. \n On the plus side, the prose is stellar, really wrapping the reader in this world within a world. The emotional landscape is rich and I had a great experience feeling Death's pain, Ari's deep love, Mal's isolation and Kismet's fear. The action is fast and fierce, with copious attacks, rescues and near-death experiences for far too many immortals. Looking forward to the next installment! (Fingers crossed for a some love scenes!!!!) \n I received a review copy of this book via NetGalley."}

To me, they are just plot devices to tell the origin story of this world and not much else. They pale in comparison to my Falling Kingdoms babies, and this makes me way less invested in this series's story."}
{"text": "The beginning for me was a little bit choppy. I had wanted Jamie to explain the characters backgrounds, ethnicity since they were a foreign fantasy type, and their goddess herself. \n It was almost like a world of its own. The Goddess Danu was a sorceress praised like a religious figure whose bloodline carried on the throne. Samantha a young princess, who in my opinion needed more time to mature, was very troubled by the pressure of finding a suitor to marry. It was hard for me to connect with Samantha at first, and even through out the book I felt like I was losing sight of her. Sometimes she could sound humble and caring, yet at the same time she was calculating and rude. Taking her station for granted and talking down to her workers, yet she was upset when she seen others mistreat peasants and people of lower class. I felt like her personality was all over the place until I got deeper into the book and she took on a more one dimensional frame. \n My favorite character was Robbie. His background reminded me of Arthur from the Sword in the stone with a mixture of Cinderella, with an abusive father and older brother, a penchant for being bullied easily. I wanted him to fight for himself. If he possessed power...why didn't he use it? Why weren't they so afraid of him they cowered in his presence? \n As I got deeper into the book I began to like it, although at first I didn't think I would because I felt like I couldn't get a great connection in the beginning. As the story progressed the reader is given insight into the two kingdoms that merged to form one, the King's secrets and a binding love that surpasses magic, hate and misunderstanding. \n It turned out to be a very enjoyable book."}
{"text": "I loved this book, but I'm can't be objective about this book saga, because it's one of my favorites. Is it perfect? Hello no. Some things don't really make sense to me, and there were plot points where I felt the solution was corny and a bit predictable. I would have liked that the last 30-40 pages have their own book because it felt rushed. But I still loved it. \n I love the universe, the characters, and I loved the ending. It was everything I needed. It wasn't what I wanted, but you can't always get what you want. If it were for me, I would have a fourth book, about everything that comes next. I want to know what happens to the world and to every character. But the ending made sense, it came to a bit of an ironic full circle, but a happy one. And there were so many things that I didn't see comming! \n I didn't imagine at all Calamity's identity. Or his weakness. And David's powers... they are defitively fitting. \n Also, his dad in the parallel universe was such a happy surprise! \n I wanted to see what happens with Prof, because I don't know if he can ever forgive himself. Maybe he should also go to some other reality to talk to Tia? \n I want at least 3 more books about David and the gang fighting bad epics. And he forming a team of Epics that want to redeem themselves."}

{"text": "City of Bones was a good book, I wasn't crazy about it like I have been with other series I have read lately. I think that it just took awhile to get everything explained and the characters developed. Once you got through all that, it was pretty good. Claire and Jace were just awesome together. I really liked Jace a lot, he had the attitude of \"I just don't care\" but then would be so protective of Claire. \n There was a pretty interesting twist in this book, that I definitely did not see coming. It really threw me and changed the whole dynamic of things. So even though this started out slow for me, by the time I finished the book, I was ready to start the second one. I have heard that this series just gets better with each book. So I'm looking forward to reading the next one!"}
{"text": "I really enjoyed the book, it was a good start for a sequel to one of my favorite series, Percy Jackson and the Olympians.

{"text": "Thirty Scary Tales by Rayne Hall is a collection of short stories encompassing an array of settings, narration styles and topics with theme of 'scary'. \n There are tales of vampires, ghosts, magic and dreams and other supernatural elements. They are all beautiful and enjoyable but do not compare to the pleasure and intrigue I experienced while reading The Grey Walker, Arete, Through the Tunnel, The Colour of Dishonour, Burning and The Painted Staircase - just to name a few. \n There are a few stories set in Rayne Hall's dark epic fantasy novel Storm Dancer such as The Colour of Dishonour, The Grey Walker, and Each Stone, A Life. Each of these stories is exceptional in its vividness, creativity and unfathomable twists! You have no idea what you're up against! \n Thirty Scary Tales boasts a ton of stunning imagery in this collection, whether scary or just plain beautiful. The reader cannot help but highlight and enjoy. The author also uses an array of settings for tales ranging from Germany to England to Turkey, and extending from Ancient Greece to the Middle Ages to modern times. \n One of the Storm Dancer-set stories is The Colour of Dishonour with its layers of puns and irony (\"I have blood on my hands\"). I still cannot shake off the admiration (for Hall) and the horror (for the Captain). The Colour of Dishonour is a 10-star story. \n By Your Own Free Will makes you think: How far would you go for love? How much are you willing to sacrifice to be noticed by one man? Would you trade your IQ for it? \n Special thanks to Rayne Hall for creating and collecting this set of stories in a single volume and for sending me a free copy of Thirty Scary Tales for a Halloween review. I enjoyed reading them all. As for the Storm Dancer-set stories, this collection has prompted me to begin reading the dark epic novel as soon as I can. \n For the full (extended) review: please click here (no spoilers): http://nadanessinmotion.blogspot.com/..."}
{"text": "In a \"A Hidden Witch\", Debora Geary reintroduced me to her wonderful cast of characters from Book One, and then moved them to beautiful Nova Scotia, so I was hooked from the start. She drew me into the atmosphere of a small outport in that maritime province by playing on all five senses with her descriptions of the sea breezes, smooth beach rocks, and rough seas. I loved the way she integrated the magical with the real, such as having the witches help the local fisherfolk in dealing with algae bloom. I particularly enjoy Geary's talent for making me 'feel' the energy and emotions as her witches cast their spells although in this story, the meshing of technology with the magic was a bit laborious in places (It was still an intriguing and inventive concept). I'll look forward to reading the next in this series."}
{"text": "I loved the setting of this book. The history, the time, the country, the palace, the gods. I loved the descriptions, how I could almost smell the cinnamon in the story. And I liked Eona and Ryko, at least at first. Lady Dela was definitely the best character in the book. She was the only sincere character, the only on not pretending to be something she is not. I love how this books takes on sexuality, what is like to be a eunuch, a contraire, and how woman are viewed as inferior by men but how woman know what powerful and honorable they can be, even if its not recognized by men. \n What I hated about this book: the secrets and the naivety. I did get why Eona had to cover her identity, but once she was chosen, I think the emperor would have used her and trusted her just as much (or maybe even more; being a woman, she could have been married with his son and empowered him more than as a friend). I also couldn't stand how she didn't tell anyone anything, ever. Not about the folio, the sun drug, the dragon's name, her identity, etc. She even had a freaking hard time telling her master she couldn't do some fight form. And then it was the naivety. I mean, really, when the reader figures things out way before the character does, and we have no extra information whatsoever, it just becomes annoying. Eona is so intuitive, why would she be so blind? \n I mean, she figures out that the Dragon wants her to call herfself Eona at the beggining. She evens says her name at the mirror in the bathroom, and sees the reaction. How could she not understand what this means? Then she uses sun drug to try to use the dragon's power, when this drug hides youw femenine side. I mean, really? It was clear she needed to get in touch with her femenine side. And the writing at the folio... why didn't she just asked Dela? It didn't make any sense. \n At the end, I liked some aspects of the story, but it exasperated me too much."}
{"text": "This is the 5th installment of Artemis Fowl. All of the familiar characters are here and yet the adventures and problems are anything but stale. In addition to the usual magical beings, this episode includes demons and their island that is caught in a time warp. Artemis has a worthy opponent in the guise of a young female genius, Minerva. It seems that young Artemis is about to enter the joys and thrills of puberty! Both Minerva and Artemis are attempting to snare a member of the demon world and add to that a psychotic employee wanting revenge against demons and you have the makings of a great adventure. \n Eoin Colfer has created another quick moving and eye-opening story. Although this is a young adult series, I find that Artemis and his company of associates are quite intriguing and enjoyable."}

{"text": "(FOR THE SHORT REVIEW SKIP TO THE BOTTOM) \n Not since \"Catcher in the Rye\" have I felt that a book was written specifically for me. Not that much is really shared between them, except they are those rare books that brim with complete and utter awesomeness. They were also that exact book I needed to read at that exact point in life. \n Upon reading the cover flap I thought I was in store for something a bit pulpy and moderately derivative. This is something I usually don't mind since I am very fond of genre fiction. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that while getting the gist of the story absolutely right the flap-writers also got it wrong. Rarely have I been happier. \n Why read this book? \n Why not? \n The writing style is fun, yet serious. The characters are multi-dimensional and well utilized. The plotting perfectly navigates that dangerous ground between the fields of literary and (believable? understandable?) science fiction. Unfortunately, this may be a flaw, as unimaginative readers of both stripes may just give this one a skip. \n What else, Ryan? Tell us. \n Sure thing, no problem. \n Perfectly placed comedic gems are liberally scattered through the book, even as horrific events unfold. There is love and war and kung fu scenes never before found between such day-glo covers. More importantly there is terrible sadness and friendship and that wonderful all-that-matters-at-the-end-of-the-day trait called loyalty. \n Now, I don't like to beg (not true), but I implore you to give this one a chance. Step out of your comfort zone, grab this pink, fuzzy book and hold on for dear life. When you are finished reading you will approach me. I will nod calmly and knowingly as you offer your neverending thanks for making you read \"The Gone Away World\". \n SHORT REVIEW: \n If you didn't have a pulse this book would give you one."}
{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n I absolutely loved this collection of novellas. I thought they were extremely well written and I thought each one was equally captivating in its own way, but they all built off of each other to tell one story. \n The hardest part of reading Heir of Fire for me was seeing Celaena so broken and depressed. I loved reading these novellas because we got to see more of the old fiery, sarcastic Celaena, who I love reading about. It was so hard getting to know Sam because I shipped him and Celaena so much even though I knew it wasn't going to end well. I'm really glad I read these before starting Queen of Shadows because I learned a lot about Arobynn and what an ass he is, and he is going to be an important part of Queen of Shadows, so now I am really looking forward to that confrontation and for Celaena to (hopefully) get her revenge."}
{"text": "In context of the book, the movie isn't really so bad, it's good ... it's actually a fair representation given where science is at in today's world."}
{"text": "4.5 Stars for this one! I've talked to some young readers who've recently devoured the series, and they report it's not THEIR kind of book, but, as an adult reader, I adored it. \n So. I bought the hype, somewhat. I've read all the HP books with my eldest, nearly 20 years old now, and I couldn't resist this one, even though it's not a novel. It's a play. Expect stage directions and all if you pick it up. It's also not really a kid's story. Which is totally fine because the last three books, IMHO, were for elder readers-late teen to adult. How many ten year olds really want to slog through THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX, after all? \n That said, this book makes a distinct break because a large portion of the story is told from an adult POV, that of Harry Potter at ages 37-40. He's married with three children and one of his kids, the middle child Albus Severus Potter, is a misfit. Not only does Albus get sorted into Slytherin, his best friend is outcast Scorpius Malfoy, only child of Draco Malfoy. Albus struggles with his auspicious parentage, especially as he doesn't possess the fantastic gifts at wizardry of his father, or even his popular elder brother, James. Further, Albus and Harry have a very strained relationship. Harry struggles as a parent to Albus, but has no issues with James and Lily. It isolates Albus, even when Harry makes deliberate attempts, fruitless though they are, to connect. \n Meanwhile, Scorpius is haunted by rumors that his father is truly Voldemort, and he's mercilessly harangued at Hogwarts. Albus stays by his side, and they develop a strong, true friendship. The plot gets very messy when a Time Turner is discovered by the Ministry of Magic. See, Time Turners are outlawed because changing the past is a BIG PROBLEM. And, the experimental Time Turner is able to bring people back far further than ever imagined. One person in particular, Amos Diggory, wants Harry to go back and save his lost son, Cedric. This cause, saving The Spare who was murdered in Harry's stead, becomes of prime importance for 14 year-old Albus. And he recruits Scorpius and Cedric's cousin, Delphi, to assist in stealing the Time Turner from his Aunt Hermione in order to pull off this daring rescue. \n I think we all know this goes poorly. As all adults will opine, changing the past is fraught with collateral damage. And that's exactly what happens. While we're never eager to embrace the atrocities that have come to pass, we also know that undoing such things, say by murdering Hitler as a child or something, would lead to so many unforeseen consequences that our world would be irrevocably altered. So, the play, the story, embraces the worst of these outcomes, and builds real terror for Albus and Scorpius. It harkens to the adage \"No good deed goes unpunished,\" and we experience a great deal of punishment in this fiction-scape. \n As an adult, I relished the nuances of the story. I expect many younger kids won't. They don't have the maturity to fully experience the adult POV, but so many of the readers of this series are adults, and I believe that those people are, like myself, well satisfied. Several themes are similar to all HP books: friendship saves the day, valor is a consequence of situation-not a goal to seek, and courage is being who you are, regardless of consequence. The old ties are strong, and new ties can be beneficial. It was rewarding, to me, to see Harry and Draco on the same side, openly, for the first time. I liked how all the pieces fit together, in the same way that they always have. I didn't feel as if I was wondering, much, and I liked the pacing of the story. I'm out of practice reading plays, but fell right in once I got started. In truth, it was refreshing not having the ponderous descriptions of setting bog me down, just this once. That said, I much prefer novels, on the whole. Though, in reality, this book would have been twice as big if it had been a novel. I was able to follow along with all the scene changes and implied emotive notes without any difficulty. Younger readers might struggle with the format, which is the sentiment I've gathered from those who have read the book already. \n I really do not want to spoil the book, but it must be said that both Voldemort and his progeny are present on the page, albeit briefly. It's a bittersweet read with tons of action and a plot that satisfied. I literally read the book in the span of an evening, so you know the pace is fantastic."}

{"text": "It is a good read. A nice continuation to the story."}
{"text": "This book was more modest in its ambitions than any volume of the magisterial first Mistborn trilogy but it was still a rollicking good read. The plot was well constructed, the characterizations were strong, the banter-y dialogue was enjoyable to read. It also did a good job of setting up some great mysteries for subsequent volumes. I am also really excited to find out that volumes two and three are coming out relatively soon so I don't have to wait too long to see the continuation of this story."}
{"text": "Bought it for the beautiful cover and very readable excerpt. The story has a lot of things going on. This could easily be a trilogy of slightly shorter books, with each event fleshed out. And to make it clear, this is not a romance with contemporary fantasy elements. This is a contemporary fantasy with some romantic elements. It's also not particularly well-written, but Bachar has a knack for the interesting, and makes it very accessible to the reader. This is definitely an author to watch."}
{"text": "I don't think there is any other word than Amazing for this book. It is epic, as everyone knows. Sam was lovely for his quirks, Frodo for his courage, Merry and Pippin for their friendship, Boromir for his bravery, Gimli for his stoutness, Legolas for his keen knowledge and Gandalf for his wisdom. LOTR explains very well what power can do to people. It is a sweet tale, well-told, and by a Master story teller. \n Most people have seen the movies. I am glad I did not. It helped me get excited with each hurdle that Frodo and Sam crossed successfully in their journey, and rightly disappointed when certain characters died. \n After I was done reading, I felt, \"Wow, all this was imagined? No, it must have happened somewhere and this is just a mere record\". The book, in all its magic, is that original and appealing."}
{"text": "3.5 STAR. Gemma gains a lot of ground and information in this book. She blunders through her talent and is poppoing in and out of places a bit too much. Once she and Alex are on their quest to enter The Underworld, the adventure takes a linear aspect. I enjoyed the last third of the book emensly. Still, she never knows who she cam trust. Luckily, Alex and Layland are on her side, even if they show it in different ways. Will she be able to rescue her Mom? Will any of their actions change the course of the future? Will Gemma be in one piece in the end? All good questions that may have an answer in the end."}
{"text": "This is the third book in the YA steampunk Finishing School series. It is best to read these books in order. \n World note: the story takes place in a steampunk setting, in 1850's England, where vampire and werewolves are a part of society. \n Sophronia is a 16 y/o student at Mlle. Geraldine's Finishing Academy for Young Ladies--which is in truth a training school for female spies. This year, Sophronia's education includes lessons in seduction... \n \"Seduction in its purest form is a never-ending acquisition of knowledge about another individual. Every male is a new challenge, every occasion warrants a different approach Take the greatest of care when applying these techniques, for they can be more dangerous than actual weaponry.\" \n The girls all straightened. Lady Linette's lessons were always interesting, but seduction was supposed to be the best. What young lady didn't want to know how to manipulate a man? This was what finishing school was all about! \n Sophronia has a BF, Dimity who is more interested in a normal life after school, but Sophronia knows she has several options in front of her. She has an unknown (but she suspects royal) patron who pays her schooling. Plus, she receives regular gifts from a rogue vampire Lord Akeldama high in London society. She has a bosom friend in Lady Kingair \"Sidheag\" whose family is a pack of werewolves in Scotland. \n It is when Sidheag receives notice that her beloved pack is in disarray and her great-great-grandfather has challenged for Alpha of a London pack, that life goes wonky. Sidheag flees to London to intercept Lord Kingair accompanied by the werewolf arms training teacher, Captain Niall--which will absolutely ruin Sidheag. \n Meanwhile, Sophronia and Dimity are released form school to attend the engagement ball of Sophronia's brother. Who also has garnered invitations? Dimity's brother PilloverFe and Felix, Lord Mersey both whom attend the companion school, Bunson's School for Evil Geniuses. Pillover isn't much of a fan of Felix, and neither is Sophronia's (inappropriately close) acquaintance Soap. Soap is a black boy who works as a sootie at Mlle Geraldine's, tending the boilers and boys who also work below decks. \n It seems that Soap and Felix have a bit of a tendresse for Sophronia, thought Sophronia's of mixed opinion on them. She knows Soap is an unsuitable mate; he has no family, and even worse prospects. But Felix, despite being son of an Earl, is also allied with the Picklemen--a secret society which despises the supernaturals in society and wishes to control communication across the nation. As a friend to Sidheag, and receiving aid from a vampire, Sophronia is not opposed to the supernatural, and the Picklem tried to kill her and Dimity in previous books, so she's decidedly against Picklemen. \n Felix, on the other hand... \n And then he was bending down, looking as if he might actually kiss her--in the back of an open cart! \n Turns out that this love triangle intensifies as Soap stows away to keep Sophronia from falling into Felix's affection. Pillover settles this rather succinctly: \n He addressed Soap, \"Although I respect the courage of a man who wears sating breeches THAT tight, but in the end you'll have to cede to Lord Mersey. He's too much of a peer, you understand? And a bit of a prick, as well.\" \n Interruption of the engagement ball by Sidheag and two werewolves is almost a welcome distraction. Especially when all the mechanicals of the house go absolutely bonkers. Sophronia, Dimity, Sidheag, Felix and Soap depart to bring Sidheag to Scotland, so she can help her uncles in the pack who are likely to be slaughtered now that they have no Alpha and are accused of treason. The ladies dress as boys to ease travel--though this is scandalous--stowaway aboard a train and the trip is entirely eventful. \n There are two shot victims, two vampire drones tossed over, and three females trained for espionage who pretty much save the day. Felix is \"rescued\" by his father, the Duke and upstanding Picklemen, but not before declaring himself... \n \"Ouch, darling, must you be so rough?\" \n \"Just stoppering up your silly mouth.\" \n \"I know a better way.\" He pursed his lips at her. \n Soap isn't quite as lucky. Though he does live to see another day. \n This series is a hoot, for real. I love the wit, and the banter. It's truly fun, and the new advent of more teen-speak is welcome. Sophronia's world is one of strict social mores, but what does one do when confronted by an aristocratic werewolf in all his hairy...dangly, glory? \n How on earth was Dimity going to react to dangly bits? Will she faint? She'll probably faint. \n Spoiler alert: She didn't faint. \n Still, the book ends with the love triangle slightly bent, Sophronia with a direct patron, and a lot of 'splainin' for Felix, Lord Mersey. Can't wait to find out more..."}
{"text": "3.5 Stars \n This book was really interesting. I liked the way the author incorporated concepts of psychology and physics into the story (even though some of them, like hypnosis, actually weren't accurate it was still cool) and the plot itself was really neat. Besides the plot, the other thing I liked best were Natalie's relationships with her family and Megan. I didn't really buy her relationship with Beau being as all-encompassing and important as it was, but maybe that's just me. Other than that, I really enjoyed this book. The last 50 or so pages blew my mind and the book as a whole will definitely stick with me!"}
{"text": "Auja, a young oak, discovers that humans are trashing their world and without help from someone, the forest of Southcrop will wither and die. In her leaves, she comes across a crawler (caterpillar) not seen for thousands of years. He calls himself Fur. For Auja, and the future of her forest, Fur is the answer to their dreams. But it's a long, tough and dangerous world out there for such a meek, little thing that is both a single intelligent being, and a whole colony of caterpillars at once. With the help of the trees' Southcrop Vision, they are able to communicate with each other, and help Fur on a quest he must undertake to save the forest. He must reach Riverside Farm before it is destroyed to pass on the knowledge of the trees, and a special gift, of which even little Fur does not fully understand at the time. Nor does he realise how special he is. \n Southcrop Forest is one of those books that I kept stopping to say to my husband, \"Did you know...?\", which I know is very annoying when you are not the person reading the book, but I just can't help myself sometimes, and I needed to share this as I read! It's cleverly written, in that is is a story about a Tent caterpillar on a mission, talking trees that can communicate with Southcrop Vision, and other insects, birds and animals - each with their own distinct personalities. I could easily picture this as one of those cute animated Disney films, where they try to keep the cartoon characters true to their natural characters, but with the additional \"human\" ability to talk and act cute at the same time. Not always as easy to do in a book and can sometimes come out very forced, but not in Southcrop Forest. Yet, with all its cuteness, it is also sad, and acts as a huge slap in the face - a reality wake-up call - where the message is clear - we are destroying our beautiful and wonderful Earth. As you know, we need trees, they reduce carbon dioxide and give us oxygen, and like all the tiniest, seemingly insignificant creatures that surround us, they all have a purpose and play a big part in our survival. What are we doing for them? \n This book is a must for anyone interested in nature, ecology and the environment and, of course a fun read about the interdependence of various life systems in our world. It's not all cuteness and smiles, nature has a terrible way of being cruel to be kind when it comes down to survival of the fittest. Does Fur complete his quest, and fulfil his dream of flying high up in the sky near the warm sun? I'm not telling. You'll have to read it to find out."}
{"text": "Although Amazon says this book can be read as a stand alone book I think you would really miss out by not reading Her Dark Angel and Her Fallen Angel first as it really sets the story up. That being said you would still get the idea of what is happening in the story if you went straight to this one. \n Einar is one of Heaven's top hunters and has been sent to earth to track down three demons who are responsible for the deaths of humans and turning an angel to the dark side. When he tracks down one of the demons he is battling with a woman, Taylor, she is half demon half human. Einar intervenes and saves her life even though it will land him in trouble with heaven. The attraction between the two, although forbidden, is something they can no longer deny and soon act upon. \n The chemistry between the two leads was hot and I liked that the ending wasn't all fluffy but lead onto more adventure for the two of them. I think Her Fallen Angel still remains my favorite in this series but this was another fantastic edition !! :o)"}

Considering I'm far from what I would call a vampire lover, I really think this novel was a nice change of pace.

But Feyre starts realizing that normal may not work for her. \n I loved this book. The only reason I took so long reading it was because when finally Rhys and Feyre started to \"talk\", I was so happy that I didn't wanted it to end. This has to be one of my favorite romance book's ever. And don't get me wrong, it has a lot a faults. But it was still amazing. \n WARNING: SPOILERS \n Most people seem to think that Tamlin's character was changed and made a villain to get the story going. But I think he was just as broken as Feyre. The whole first book he was lying to her. And yes, he couldn't tell her anything because of the curse, but most things he kept to himself because he wanted to. He only let her participate because she was a key player in the curse. But then there were other things that were wrong, like not fighting for her at all. Sure, he didn't wanted to put her in more danger, but she was dying and he just wanted to have sex with her. Like Feyre said, he fought for her, just not as hard as she did for him. \n And Tamlin did not change. Anyone that has been in an abusive relationship will tell you that their partner loved them, cared for them, and didn't really mean what they did. Tamlin was Gaston, everyone loved him and couldn't see what a bully he was, how wrong his thinking was. At the end I felt pitty for him. Of couse, he murderer Rhy's family for power or loyalty to his father wich was unforgivable. And he betrayed everyone by his alliance with the King. But he's so sick, he's so consumed by his pain and his obsession with Feyre that I almost feel sorry for him. He obviusly need help, professional help. \n Lucian is the one tha dissapointed me to most. Extreme loyalty can be a fault. That he would let Tamlin betray everyone speaks volumes about him. \n Then there is Rhys. He was already the best character in the first book, because even if everyone else treated him like the bad guy, he always protected Feyre, always fought for her and helped her. The only thing that I didn't like was the wine thing, but I understand that he did it so she wouldn't have to remember anything about her time there. I also didn't understand why he fought so hard form her when she was about to die, but now I do. He knew from the begging that there was something abour her. They were meant for eachother even when she was human. He was perfect, his love was perfect. He respected Feyre, her opinions and her choices. He never dismissed her, and the only secrets that he kept were so she could decide for herself. I love how he trated her as his equal in every way. And how he named her High Lady, something that Tamlin wouldn't even consider possible. \n I LOVED all the night court. Mor, Cassian, Azriel and Amren were exactly what Feyre needed. Hell, I would love to hung out with them. I love Casssian and Amren most of all, but the four of them are perfect. \n I still don't like Feyre's sisters. They are so selfish, so awful. Yes, they kinda help Feyre, but because they know that if they don't they are going to die. I really hope they redeem themselves in the final book. \n The ending was so painful. I'm so scared about the next book. I hope Feyre and Rhys get back together really, really soon. I hope the book is really, really, long. And I really really really want no one to die. \n Is it May 2017 yet???"}

Probably the cutest, most-terrifying girl ever haha. \n I love how real Z is. semi- (Like one time she was like talking about something far from eyelids and then somehow recalled a memory of her peeking beneath her closed eyelid - which was quite an amusing story. Or that one time when she's creeping on Mik and had the urge to pee. And when she thought of something with the word 'cake' on it, she mused 'Mmmm. Cake' omg. Also, the fact that she just Googled all the Latin terms. And she asked a couple to boost her up. And she even had a best friend before Karou - who is now in Poland. Her emotions just feel so real. Her enthusiasm, grief, disappointments, excitement, joy, everything! \n Laini Taylor you've impressed me once again. *clap clap*"}

With a nice blend of action and romance, solid world building, and an ending that satisfies at the same time as it ensures the reader will want more, this is a winning fantasy. \n Side note: \n Apropos of nothing, this novel kept bringing to mind the classic poem \"Fire and Ice\" by Robert Frost: \n Some say the world will end in fire, \n Some say in ice. \n From what I've tasted of desire \n I hold with those who favor fire. \n But if it had to perish twice, \n I think I know enough of hate \n To say that for destruction ice \n Is also great \n And would suffice. \n With thanks to Little, Brown Books for Young Readers and Netgalley for providing access to an advanced copy of this novel."}

{"text": "Volevo leggere da tanto tempo questo libro e grazie a un giveaway finalmente ho avuto il piacere di farlo *-* Ringrazio di cuore l'autrice per avermi scelta ma ora veniamo a noi u.u \n La narrazione inizia con la descrizione della vita di Erika che ha tutto un lavoro, un fidanzato e una vita tranquilla nella citta di Rimini eppure questo idillio viene rotto dal tradimento del suo compagno che la mette davanti alla verita: conduce una vita che non l'appaga, non la soddisfa. Successivamente si trasferisce in Val di Fassa o meglio a Canazei, in questo luogo dove la natura la fa da padrone, conoscera nuove persone come Stella, Thomas, Ambra e una che la colpira piu di tutte, Jason. \n Tutti nel luogo in cui vive le dicono che Jason e pericoloso, che i suoi occhi neri sono spaventosi ma Erika non li vede neri per lei sono due magnifici occhi verdi. Grazie a un piccolo incidente avra modo di conoscerlo e da quell'incontro nascera qualcosa di profondo e proibito. Ben presto scoprira che Jason e un Angelo della Morte che con un bacio toglie la vita pertanto non potranno mai spingersi oltre, cosa che si rivelera difficile visto il loro legame. Da subito si presenteranno degli ostacoli che metteranno a dura prova la loro tempra e il loro rapporto tanto da spingere Erika a compiere un viaggio pericoloso ma necessario per salvare il suo amore. \n La trama mi ha presa ma quello che mi ha conquistata sono le descrizioni cosi realistiche, per non parlare dei particolari relativi alle attivita di trekking, alle arti marziali e delle cavalcate che danno quel qualcosa in piu che permette al lettore di sentirsi sul posto col personaggio. Sono certa che l'autrice abbia inserito molto delle sue esperienze personali. Particolarmente interessante e la parte relativa al viaggio di Erika nella Valle degli Spiriti anche se avrei preferito saperne di piu >_< \n Unica pecca la velocita con cui si evolve la storia d'amore, essendo una romanticona avrei preferito leggere qualche scena in piu tra i due protagonisti. Lo stile e piacevole, fluido, giovanile e fresco. Credo si possa paragonare questo libro a una dolce brezza che avvolge il lettore per poterlo accompagnare in un piccolo viaggio alla fine del quale capira che per avere cio che si vuole, non dovra mai arrendersi davanti agli ostacoli che la vita ci pone davanti. Spero tanto in un seguito *c* e nel frattempo lo consiglio a tutti coloro che amano gli angeli, le storie d'amore e la natura."}

I think L.J. Smith deserves a round of applause, if she hasn't already ;) I think I was really liking this for 2 reasons only. 1: Nick and Cassie's relationship and how it develops 2: Faye.. FRICKING... Chamberlain! My favorite character in this whole book, wouldn't be Cassie, wouldn't be Diana, wouldn't even be the Henderson boys for their humor.. but Smith really made me love Faye Chamberlain!

{"text": "See full review for Shadow of Night at: http://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.w... \n As a rule, I don't like time-traveling books. It's nothing personal against authors or anything like that, but I just don't like them. It's hard to get my brain wrapped around the idea that these people who are traveling back in time make changes to the time line that have dire consequences, and most of the time when the time traveling takes place, you're most of the way through the book so all these events that these characters change have already happened. It just doesn't compute with my brain. That being said, I was really surprised with how much I liked Shadow of Night considering it's very time travel heavy. \n When we last left Diana and Matthew at the end of A Discovery of Witches, they were traveling to the past to find Ashmole 792 and a witch that could help her with her wayward magic. At the beginning of book 2, they have successfully traveled back in time. Now the couple has to transition to the time they have traveled to, and get used to certain people being alive - Matthew's father Philippe. While on this journey, Diana and Matthew are finally officially married and the wedding night is definitely worth the wait. Their adventures are comical and serious and...well, like I said I'm surprised I loved this book so much."}
{"text": "This is certainly the most grown up book of the series so far. There is more real-world violence and adult themes, including violent animal death and mention of an attempted rape. \n Will is back again, and almost has a personality this time. We also get to meet Bran, whom I like almost as much as Jane. The Drew siblings do not appear in this book. There were parts that got bogged down with exposition, and I didn't think it was clear at the beginning that Will had forgotten he was an Old One, until he suddenly remembered. \n This book is not as tightly paced as Greenwitch was, but I enjoyed it at least as much as Over Sea, Under Stone, and more than The Dark is Rising."}

This book had elements of every kind of story that I love! \n The main character, Scarlett, is a wonderfully developed heroine. After reading so many stories with strong female leads that all start to feel familiar and like repeats of the ones before them, Scarlett was a total breath of fresh air! \n The characters, story and world building were all wonderfully done. Beautiful use of imagery throughout the entire book. The authors painted a perfect picture for me as a reader! \n I pretty much devoured this story and can't wait to see where it will go next! My biggest regret is that I didn't read sooner! Well done guys! Well done!"}

I'm hoping that the rest of the series will pick up. \n I wish there was a bit more flamel and a little less of the twins but we can't always get what we want :)"}
{"text": "Ever have one of those books where you wonder why you didn't really care for the first? This is one of those. I LOVED this sequel. I almost feel if this depth had been applied to the first book I would have raved about the series a lot more then I did. \n I really felt that Hardy brought a depth and level to this series that was lacking from the first book. This book really connected with me. Allowed me to see the characters, experience their feelings and understand what was going on in terms of the magic, the world and events. \n I also love that this book has a very unique concept with the whole Taking and Healing and all that. I feel like it hasn't been done before and really brings a fresh voice to fantasy."}
{"text": "It is very rare that I won't finish a book due to some OCD complex that I have about seeing something through to the end. This book tested my resolve. In fact I only finished it in the end because I set myself an insane task to read 100 books in a year. \n Thinking back, in 1991, I would have been 11 years old and desparately not trying to be rude here, my 11 year old self was writing stories like this. It is a shame that I hadn't read TVD books before I started reading the more recent gems from Richelle Mead because they just don't compete. They don't even compete with the writing in LJ Smith's Night World novels which I read before TVD as well - and I wasn't a fan of those either. \n It is perhaps unfair to judge a series written clearly for very young adults when you are a thirty something. However JK Rowling completely lifted the bar with children's writing, so it probably isn't unkind to say that these books are the equivalent of Mills & Boon for young teens but where you don't really care for the characters. \n That said, LJ Smith clearly enjoys writing about her evil characters - Damon always seems a well rounded character which you can sympathise with while you just want to stab Stefan for being so.... blah. \n Let's just say I'm trying to be nice because I adore the TV series (which doesn't escape from its own mediocre writing sometimes) but I really didn't enjoy this book. Although the taster chapter for book four at the end of the book was actually the best bit of LJ Smith's writing I've read and I found myself wanting to see if I could borrow it from the library.... yeek!"}

{"text": "I like how this book started and how it ended. I'm not sure I liked the in between. The very beginning was detailed and definitely set the scene for a horror story. The middle was more like a regular young adult book but with some gore mixed in every once in a while. I enjoyed the story between Tana and Gavriel. Aside from that, there was a reason that it took me over a year to finish this book. It never really caught my interest enough. But for those who enjoy the gore of horror novels and the popishness of YA books, this would be a good choice."}
{"text": "Oh man, this book was SO much better than the second one. SO many plot twists and a LOT of characters died. I'm back into that GOT hype, and I can't wait to read A Feast For Crows. One thing I love about this series is how multi-dimensional all the characters are. Cersei's a bitch but we understand why she does what she does and to some extent, I respect her. Daenerys was the bad ass bitch I love, Tyrion is awesome as always, Jaime was more complicated than he originally appeared, Arya was awesome as always, Jon was cool as always, Catelyn was the bad ass mom she always is, Brann has exceedingly become boringer, and Sansa, well. With Sansa I'm either annoyed at her or I feel sorry for her. It was both in this book. I'm looking forward to where the story goes after this."}
{"text": "See full review for Once a Witch at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n So, if you haven't been able to tell, I have a niche when it comes to paranormal books. Female heroines who are outcasts and sublimate that with their sarcasm. But then something huge happens that makes them somewhat normal and the whole world rests on their shoulders. And of course, there's always the hot guy who tags along as their sidekick/love interest. Just like that you've pretty much got Once a Witch. Don't get me wrong, I loved the character of Tamsin and her need to be normal, she kind of reminded me of Stacey in the Blue is for Nightmares series. The addition of Gabriel was just maddening, but in a good way."}
{"text": "The book was descriptive and somewhat interesting. But it was unrealistic and dry at some parts. And ash was just pucking annoying."}
{"text": "This book followed in the footsteps of it's predecessors - insta-love with the mating bond, the usual shifter things including mental telepathy and hot alpha males, the closeness of the pack - but this one had something additional thrown in with the inclusion of a child. \n For me, it's very much a light read without much thinking involved - a little bit of escapism into a fantasy world. The strength of the story was in the handling of Hayley and not glossing over her presence and what that meant for her father - the child really did come first."}
{"text": "This book was o.k., it was very easy reading which is nice. A lot of dialogue, though it probably could have used a little more filling in with descriptions. Just my opinion. \n I was a little bit disappointed by the ending, but the book grabbed and kept you until you got there."}
{"text": "I didn't like this one as much as the first book. There's too many similarities to Twilight, Harry Potter and Sookie series."}
{"text": "For me, this ending is absolute perfect. I laughed, I cried and I cheered. I remember when reading this book for the first time all I could think was, \"How the hell are they going to make a movie out of this?!\" So much big things happen trough out the entire book that (even though I hate it when they split the last movie of a series in two, for me it feels like they just want to make that much more money on the franchise)I completely understand the movie was made in two parts. Still hey missed a lot in the movie, but obviously you can't get everything in there (plus that leaves us bookreaders with that extra edge of \"I know more than you\"-muhaha). \n \"Tell me one last thing,\" said Harry. \"Is this real? Or has his been happening inside my head?\" \n Dumbledore beamed at him, and his voice soundend loud and strong in Harry's ears even though the bright mist was descending again, obscuring his figure. \n \"Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?\" \n I felt it was necessary that some special characters died, because otherwise the ending would be too soft for me, especially since the last three books became rather dark. That didn't mean that I didn't find it heartbreaking, but it just seemed right. Also, I loved how badass some characters were. Like Molly Weasley in her fight against Bellatrix Lestrange, professor McGonagall when Harry arrived at school, Neville Lungbottom but most of all: Harry himself. Harry was completely epic in the last fight against Voldemort. One thing I hated about the movie was the fact that nobody really saw the fight between them, while in the book they have an entire audience (thank god for that, that boy earns the credit). \n \"It's not a case of what you'll permit, Minerva McGonagall. Your time's over. It's us what's in charge here now, and you'll back me up or you'll pay the price.\" \n And he spat in her face. \n Harry pulled the Cloack off himself, raised his wand, and said, \"You shouldn't have done that.\" \n As Amycus spun around, Harry shouted: \"Crucio!\" \n The Death Eater was lifted off his feet. He writhed through the air like a drowning man, trashing and howling in pain, and then, with a crunch and a shattering of glass, he smashed into the front of a bookcase and crumpled, insensible, to the floor. \n \"I see what Bellatrix meant,\" said Harry, the blood thundering through his brain, \"you really need to mean it.\" \n Although The Order of the Phoenix remains my favorite book of the series, this epic ending comes closely second and moves The Goblet of Fire to third place. \n I may have gone a little crazy while adding quotes from the book in my updates (so definitely check those out), but there are just so much fun and intense lines in this book. I would have added more if there wasn't a limit on characters per update."}
{"text": "This author had a hard road to walk -- mixing fantasy with history. It's a fast read, and an entertaining one, and yeah, made me tear up toward the end... but I had a few problems with it. \n The author chose not to incorporate hardly any historical figures out of respect for the ship's passengers. I get that, and I admire that, but it also means there's rarely a moment during the first several hundred pages when the reader feels this is actually taking part on Titanic! Historical figures ground fictional ones. One brief encounter with Thomas Andrews didn't make me feel like I was \"on the infamous ship.\" Plus, the whole thing was just so ridiculous I never entirely believed it -- werewolves using the Turkish Bath to change. \n Secondly, I'm a bit tired of the cliche of boy and girl falling in love over the course of the voyage. I'm not a romantic in that regard. I enjoy a good romance but when I'm reminded it took place over the course of four days, that snaps me back into disbelieving reality. Plus, all her leading ladies (minus one) have slept with someone out of wedlock by the end of the book. This is 1912. Nope, nope, nope. \n I did enjoy her conclusion, though. She had a nice twist in the last chapter."}

{"text": "Although slow at parts, this was an engaging read. But while I sought some sort of resolution to the tension, Meyer has chosen to give resolution to the world of Twilight, but not the relationships within that world. Bella's marriage, pregnancy (i don't think i'm giving anything away) and transformation were handled well and give us added insight into how the world of Cullen works. The middle section from Jacob's perspective gives us additional insight into the imprinting phenomena which he is so terrified of, and we learn about the Alpha function in the wolf pack. All of these things bring clarity to how the world of Twilight functions, and what the long term trajectory of our heroes (Bella, Edward and Jacob) will look like. And that in itself is quite an accomplishment. While the fantasia of the plot line leaves Twilight open to any number of satirical attacks, I have to say Meyer dealt with these topics in a way that satisfied my nerves and avoided the general lameness that could have easily crept in. \n Fans (and parents) should also be aware that this is the most gory of the four installments. Rationally, not a surprise, since Bella has completely crossed over into the Cullen world. So we get several hunting scenes, and interaction with vamps who do not follow the Cullen's \"vegetarian\" lifestyle, but are considered friends nonetheless. Not to mention the innate violence of the Cullen family \"way of life\" from marriage through pregnancy (which were handled discreetly). While I can see why some would criticize this, I found this satisfying, as these are the very things Edward always wanted to protect Bella from and it would have rung false had Meyer failed to bring into focus what it really means to be forever Cullen. \n On a personal note, i was struck by the Biblical illusions referenced in Bella's transformation (though i'm not sure they were intentional), which brought about a rather analytic pondering of what it will be like when the mortal body becomes immortal, and how we will look back on our human life. I cannot recall this theme being dealt with effectively in other literature I have read. In order to prevent spoilers, I will simply give the Biblical reference that kept running through my mind for those who may not be acquainted. 1 Corinthians 13:12 \"For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.\" \n On an analytic note, I found it interesting that even though the Cullen's are 'immortal' they can still die and often fight to preserve their own lives. In addition, it is implied that the Volturi are aged. Are they then, truly immortal? Or merely people of prolonged existence? From a theological perspective, immortality is victory over and release from the possibility of death. Death is no longer a threat. There is no aging, no reduction of power or vitality. In the Biblical context, immortality is an entirely different matter. \n Even though I enjoyed the book, i can see why some fans are disappointed. There is no resolution of RELATIONSHIPS which have been the focus of the Twilight series, rather the story arc continues beyond Breaking Dawn with its rivalries, power struggles, dangers and romances. True, the relationships between Bella, Edward and Jacob are resolved but we don't have a happily ever after feeling per say because the main matter of external relational conflict, with the Volturi is disturbingly unresolved. And secondarily, and far less important, the main matter of internal relational conflict (the relationship between Jacob and Reneesme) is likewise left hanging. Why? Is Meyer intentionally leaving herself an open to door to more merchandising? This seems unlikely, given that if she had been merchandise driven, these thousands of pages could have easily been broken beyond four installments. in the end, I could only conclude that: \n 1) Meyer wasn't willing to sacrifice any of her characters to make the conflict realistic - many a writer has developed an affection too great to sever. The ending that is Breaking Dawn fulfilled her desire to tell this necessary installment, releases her from having to kill off anyone, and leaves the door open to further storytelling should she desire it. With an ending so satisfying to Meyer, is it any wonder the fans feel a little miffed? If Meyer guaranteed future books, I'm sure the fan base wouldn't have had a problem with Breaking Dawn. \n 2) The other thought that came to mind is that the tidy ending is more a function of the modern novel than classic literature, of which Meyer has said she is a fan. Perhaps it satisfies our current culture's desire for immediate and complete gratification. While \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Jane Eyre\" do provide a rather full resolution to their story lines, Jane Austin never fully resolved what life would look like for the esteemed Mr. Darcy with the troublesome Mrs. Bennett as a mother-in-law. Tolstoy's \"War and Peace\" brought clarity to the main concept (the impact of the war and the main relationships), but was certainly incapable of resolving the numerous plot lines of all it's characters. Likewise, \"Wuthering Heights\" does not elaborate on the future of the happy couple. When looked at from this perspective, one wonders whether the hysteric Twilight fan base would accept any ending at all? \n If you've made it this far, you'll want to finish. 2.5 stars!"}
{"text": "I received this book through a Goodreads Giveawqay! \n Holy moly! An epic, for sure. \n I'm not sure if my meh for this book was because I couldn't sit and devote myself to it. Was it because there were all sorts of things going on in my world that were too much that didn't let me give my intellect to it? \n I like Goodreads because I get to see what my friends thought of books. And sometimes, like this time, I just don't agree. Everyone loves this one. I was meh. \n I think I get it. The whole god thing. It just didn't resonate with me."}

{"text": "barely-2 stars \n wtf *disappointed sigh*"}
{"text": "9th&up. Wow. This book was good, but pretty depressing! Kind of \"The Village\"-ish. It starts with a small closed society, a fragile bubble surrounded by the chaos and pain of reality (in this case, zombies!), with a hierarchy and social structure that holds onto order with an iron fist and a heavy does of fear and intimidation for anyone who questions the way of things. \n The heroine is a bit selfish in my opinion, she reminded me of Katniss from The Hunger Games (and there are a couple of characters that have Peeta-esqe qualities as well.) \n While Forest ultimately offers a bit of hope for the future, it is a sort of feeble light almost extinguished by pain and loss and missed opportunities for love and meaningful connection. It leaves you with the question of whether dreams and hopes are worth pursuing at all, because what you sacrifice along the way might turn out to be infinitely more valuable than the realization of the dream that you held onto for so long."}

{"text": "Here's the deal...the reason I gave this book three stars is because, contrary to what I've seen people write below, it is not a bad book. I think most of the complaints have been about the writing and, as a reader, I admit that it wasn't exemplary but I wasn't really expecting it to be when I picked up this teenage book. \n That aside, I thought that credit is due where needed. The author didn't make them \"vampires\", they're \"vampyres\". With that said, I don't understand why people are criticizing her inability to make them similar. After all, they are different species. As for them being witches instead, I think it's pretty awesome that they can work with the elements. I mean, if she wanted a book about witches, she wouldn't have given them fangs, right? The aspect of the two worlds mixed together is pretty cool. \n I'm giving it three stars because it's not the best book I've read and I think I need to save those stars for more deserving books. Is it a good past time? Yes. Is it a good story? Undoubtedly."}

{"text": "I will admit, I didn't like this book as much as the other two. It was still a great way to end a fantastic trilogy thats for sure. I just found that at some parts, I would skim over it because I thought they were unnecessary information, but thats just my opinion. Being the romantic kind of person I am, I was a bit disappointed and I feel like the ending and what happens between Gemma and Kartik was a bit odd. There is really no way else to say it. It was an odd ending for him. Im glad Libba Bray didn't kill him but still..hm... I just wish it was better in a way. I know a lot of people agree with me on this one. I wont say what happens for obvious reason of course haha. This reviews going to be pretty short because again, I was a little disappointed with Bray for this book. Nonetheless, it was a fantastic trilogy and I probably will re read the first or second book again because I truly loved them :) \n Despite what I said, I think if your a person who has read the first 2 books and now are wary because of other reviews and mine (I'v read a lot and it's the same thing as my review), all I say is, please do read this one, hey maybe you'll like the ending more than us. But ultimately, i think everyone should at least finish the trilogy even if the ending sucked a little hehe."}

If this book were longer and some of the things taken out it might have been a little better."}

{"text": "I've been seeing this book everywhere (especially as twitter icons) and so when I found it at the library, I decided to check it out and I'm so glad that I did. This book is a lot more suspense/adventure driven than romance driven, and is a nice break from the typical YA Fantasy/Romance. There's a little bit of magic, and a little bit of romantic intrigue that I think may play a larger factor in the next book, but they definitely take a back seat to Cel's struggle to win the contest to be the king's champion. \n I think one of the things I loved most about Throne of Glass was how the main plot was set up. Celaena has two bad choices--win the contest to get a position she really and truly doesn't want, or be sent back to a death camp. She's fighting for her freedom, but for the short term, freedom is just another type of prison. \n Throne of glass has a relatively large cast of characters and I enjoyed most of them. The young prince, Dorian, is not what he seems at first, and he has a conscience. It remains to be seen if he'll develop the spine to go along with it, but I liked his character a lot, though I would like to have known more about him. \n Chaol, the head guard, is brooding and doesn't trust Cel, but I loved him the longer I read. He's worried for both Dorian and Celaena, and he has the guts to act on what he thinks is right. \n There is also a foreign princess, Nehemia, and I enjoyed the intrigue and secrets surrounding her. \n One thing that did confuse me at times was the time period. I really couldn't get a firm idea of what the level of technology would equate to. They seem to wear old fashioned dresses, all though when it is prudent Celaena dons pants and shirts, they use candles for light and travel by horseback but they play games of pool and chess and cards, and have large libraries with trashy romance novels. There were other more modern touches as well, which seemed a bit out of place."}
{"text": "Another alternate POV fairy tale. This time he takes aim at Scrooge. This one is interesting and tells the story of the spirits origins. The chapters are seemingly random at first and a mysterious woman is leading the story. The name of the novel aptly describes the reader during a lot of the book. And the ending left me with more questions than answers. I couldn't choose one quote that described the book for me since Maguire's language is generally poetic and lovely. The general way mundane things are described just tickles my fancy. \"They perched on unreasonable stools.\" \"She spilled the indifferent coffee.\""}

She assigns Lirium a mentor to train him to better cope with the strain of debt collecting. Within pages Lirium's fighting for his life and swearing vengeance. \n Gotta catch the next episode!"}

{"text": "Wish for Me by A. Star is the first instalment in The Djinn Order series. It is an action-packed steampunk, adult, fantasy and romance novel. \n The novel is narrated in the first person by Glory St. Pierre, who seems rebellious but is plain obnoxious. Glory stumbles on a strange looking vase which turns out is more of a genie or Djinn lamp. The contraption, nothing like the lamp Aladdin finds, houses the Djinn Irving Amir, who gives Glory the chance to make three wishes. The two characters start out their relationship on a sarcastic note but an arrow to Irving's shoulder quickly changes their relationship. \n Although there is significant character development for Glory, the protagonist and narrator, I did not like her; I liked her sometimes but those instances were few. The first few chapters put me off the two characters but bit by bit I began to like Irving Amir and respect him. \n Apart from the sweet-talk and \"uber-sexy abs\" and away from the early dislike of humans, Irving is overall an experienced, wise and loveable character, as opposed to Glory. \\ \n \"Humans are shallow creatures with shallow desires and they only ever wish for shallow things. Fame, infinite wealth, love from the one who would not love them otherwise... the story is always the same.\" This Irving's view of human in chapter one, but as the novel progresses, his view begins to change and begins to fall for Glory and she for him, although at first she is more attracted to him sexually than anything else. \n The sarcasm coming from both characters offers a bit of comic relief every now and then to ease the tension, which is a lot in the novel. \n After Irving gets a poisoned arrow to his shoulder and Glory accidentally wishes for magic, things change drastically. Both become hunted by more than one side. \n The ending of Wish for Me was much stronger than I anticipated. Not only that, many of the hunter-prey roles become reversed as Irving and Glory must team up with enemies to fight other enemies. \n A. Star uses several Arabic words and names, which I thought was cute considering Arabic is my mother tongue. \n I enjoyed the contraptions created by Irving. He likes to tinker and create. In his realm, everything is mechanical - the steampunk element - and I enjoyed the description of many of his creations, especially Nagi. \n One of the things that bothered me while reading, however, was the author's constant and repetitive use of \"questioned\". I mean there are options like \"asked\" and \"said\", and certainly others, but the excessive use of \"questioned\" irritated me beyond measure - it was worth a star or half a star in my rating. \n Also, there were several major shifts, from tit-for-tat arguments to romance in a jiffy. I didn't like that and felt it disrupted the flow of the novel. It also felt awkward in places. \n The adult content in Wish for Me is mainly because of the language and a couple of love scenes, which I didn't see as romantic or at least not what I was expecting with the author's bio (below). Still it is unsuitable for ages 18 and under. \n I did enjoy the action in the novel and felt like I was in a movie. \n A. Star uses several interesting and creative images such as \"Irving still treated me like a pimple he was itching to pop.\" \n Several revelations come at the end of the novel, paving the way of the second instalment in the series, which I would like to read if I get the chance. \n Overall rating: 3.5 stars \n Note: I received a free copy of Wish for Me via Xpresso Book Tours in exchange for an honest review as part of this blog tour. \n There is a giveaway as part of the blog tour, check it out here: \n http://nadanessinmotion.blogspot.com/..."}

{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n I'm not a fan of books where one of the plot devices is to have the main characters not talk to one another about issues important to them. It took till 3/4 of the way in for Julian and Emma to talk about their feelings and all I kept thinking was \"really? Really. Really??\" (Very coherent, well thought out thoughts, I know)... But, come on. It keeps being said that it is so obvious to everyone and then no one knows. Oof. And then! Of course then Robert dies after they tell the one person that can help them with the Clave. \n It was too much. The book is an enjoyable ride, but I found myself annoyed all the way through it. This may also be because I started TMI when I was in high school and I am now reading this series in my late twenties. Maybe I'm just outgrowing it? But I don't think so. I think I'm just plain old annoyed. \n Also, side note- Annabel? I mean I just don't think she would've killed Livvy after all the build up beforehand of her character and protection of the black volume. Once again, that could be me."}

A lot of it sounded as if it was a comedians interpretation of how teenagers speak. \n Oh and \"Bow\" loses their character. In the beginning their witty with immature jokes, but later on, they begin to sound more like a \"goody toe-shoes\". Totally lost what makes you love them. \n BUT before you give up on it and declare DNF, pleeeeease get to chapter 18. That's where the sh!t hits the fan and it gets so good!

I don't think I can completely call it wrapped up since they are all just starting their lives and we have no idea what will happen, but this part is over."}

His father was a hero of the Toy Soldiers, and his mother was a venerable Sugarplum Fairy, but Tim is just, small. And he's having trouble with his boss, Noel. For some reason Noel has stopped being friendly and is surly, forcing extra work and even dirty tricks on Tim. This is especially upsetting because Tim rather fancied Noel, at first. \n Noel is a hybrid elf, tall and well-built, but with deficiencies he's trying to hide. And his feelings for tiny Tim are even more frustrating. He does feel a bit bad about his latest shenanigan and goes to check on Tim only to find both of them caught up in a bit of intrigue surrounding Prince Jack Frost and Rudy, the ginger-haired Captain of the Rein Dears. \n It seems that Noel is attracted to Tim, and doesn't know how to handle it. Good thing Jack and Rudy are sensitive, and helpful. It's a sweet tale with the barest hint of romance."}

{"text": "I really love retold fairy tales, but I also have what I think should not be a terribly picky rule: a clever concept is not a substitute for a story. A disappointingly large number of so-called \"fractured fairy tales\" fail this simple test, and the cover art and blurb for this book were not very promising, to the point where I would not have picked it up at all if I hadn't been rather impressed with this author's book \n Goblin Quest \n , which had a clever concept and a very good story. This book does not have a story which is that good; it's decent, but nothing exciting, and frankly if I hadn't already had my expectations lowered by the cover I might not have finished it. On the other hand, there was a lot of heavy exposition coupled with many, many threads left dangling, which means that sequels would be starting from a much nicer place, story-wise. I'll keep an eye out, and in the meantime I don't disrecommend this book to fairy tale fans."}

{"text": "Provided by the Author through PaC Romance group \n Fated Desire by Franca Storm is a face-paced read with a lot to offer for PNR fans from Seekers, Vampire Kings, Alphas, magic and other Realms. \n In general there is not much to the overall world-building, it is unique and in the development stages. Cora Black is of the mindset that she can turn her back on being a Seeker. However Vampire Prince Luca and Alpha Ryan Winters have different plans for Cora. Prince Luca is determined to have Cora as his bride, while Ryan discovers she is his true mate. All the while, Cora is coming into her true powers, but what is she exactly and how will it impact her future with Ryan and Luca? \n The characters were well developed with a little mystery to their backgrounds. I was left wondering why the heroine, Cora, seem to be of a 'young adult' mindset in her actions and attitude considering she is almost 30. However, don't be fooled the romance development and sexual tension between Cora, Ryan and Luca is not of a 'young adult' mindset. \n Overall storyline has potential as a great series with both romance and action for any PNR fan. I am looking forward to reading more of Cora and her men."}

{"text": "from Amazon: \n Jack Perdu, a ninth grade classics prodigy, lives his with father on the Yale University campus. Smart and introverted, Jack spends most of his time alone, his nose buried in a book. But one winter evening, a near-fatal accident changes Jack's life forever. His father sends him to see a mysterious doctor in New York City--a place Jack hasn't visited since his mother died there eight years ago. In Grand Central Terminal, he meets Euri, a girl who offers to show him the train station's hidden places--the ones only true urban explorers really know about. Eight flights below the train station, however, Jack discovers more than just hidden tracks and mysterious staircases. He has stumbled upon New York's ghostly underworld. This, Jack believes, is his chance to see his mother again. But as secrets about Euri's past are revealed, so are the true reasons for Jack's visit to the underworld. Masterfully told, The Night Tourist weaves Classical mythology together with New York's secret history and modern-day landscape to create a magical adventure, full of unexpected twists and page-turning action. \n There are so many reasons to rate books highly. And it's difficult to confine myself to a rating system that is limited by whole steps (one star, two stars, but not three and a half, for example.) So while Moby Dick gets five stars not only because I enjoy it but for its literary qualities, The Night Tourist merits five stars because it's one I am can't wait to read to my children someday (when they're out of toddlerhood. And can sit still. So, what, when they're 20? Wait, am I off topic?) \n I put Night Tourist on my wishlist after reading about it on Jen Robinson's Book Page. I scored an ARC on bookmooch, and took it to bed with me that night. \n This is not a night book. This book is fun. The action is described with such wonderful language that you can feel the chill of the New York winter, catch your breath at the dizzying heights of the tall buildings, delight in the friendship Jack develops with Euri as though you'd just made your own friend. \n In addition to being fun, Night Tourist is well written. It's one of the smoothest books I've read in a while. The pace and the storyline, the characterization and the dialogue, the layers which peel away little by little to reveal the mystery of Jack's mother all flow perfectly - not so fast that the reader gets lost, but neither too slow that the reader gets bored. I found myself in the middle of the mystery without even realizing how I'd gotten there, but completely connected with Jack as he moves through the story. \n Finally, the ending is tidy but not unbelievably so. It's nicely satisfying. \n The book is recommended for teenagers, but I think that's because of the topic of \"death\" and because there are so many references to Greek mythology. Those references might be lost on younger students who haven't studied that subject. The story itself is ideal for imaginative older elementary and certainly for middle grades - and beyond. I enjoyed it immensely, and hope my kids will, too."}
{"text": "I received a copy of this novel from NetGalley.com. I was hooked from chapter 1!

I can barely finish a Dean Koontz book-- personally, this book takes Dean and Stephen King and locks them both in a closet. \n Very well written, nail bitingly suspenseful, well rounded story line.

{"text": "Full review to come. Until then...AMAZING. \n Update 12/31/16: \n See full review for Crooked Kingdom at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n Considering my record in the last few months with anticipated releases, I thought for sure Crooked Kingdom was going to be one of those books that was going to wind up letting me down. Especially because it had been so long since I last read Six of Crows. But I should have known better. It didn't take me long to get reacquainted with the world of the Grisha and the Crows that I came to know and love during the previous book. The group hasn't really changed since the last book, they just have a new mission with a little bit more higher stakes. A member of their gang has been kidnapped and the only way they can get her back is if they trade her for the precious prize they picked up while in the Ice Kingdom. But Kaz isn't about to go down without a fight and the plans his mind comes up with are just a genius to behold. This book is one twisty ride of fun. Just when you think the Crows have met their match, Kaz shows that he really has thought of it all and will stop at nothing to get his revenge."}
{"text": "A decent conclusion to the Farwalker trilogy, but it puts me in mind of Maria V. Snyder's Study trilogy, in that, by the end of the third book, you're leagues and galaxies away from the beginning of the first. Too far away, almost, to be really believable."}

You know a story touches some part of you when you put it down and immediately want to write a poem about it. Sophie Jordan's prose are beautiful.

I know, it's cheesy, but I'm totally into pretty word pictures like that one. This book was breathtaking, so artistic and well crafted. I loved it. \n Oh, and here's my poem: \n Song of the Fire-Breathing Draki \n They call me \"it\" \n A wild unearthly thing \n Cornered in the mouth of a cave \n Shivering in a puddle of red and gold \n Trapped, wounded, dangerous . . . \n I hold my knees to my chest and stare down the hunter \n Infusing my skin, my lungs with fire \n Insisting, demanding, daring him to kill me \n To look me in the eye and send me to my death \n And yet he stands there as if frozen in time \n Caught off guard by my vulnerable face \n The emotion in my posture \n The humanity in my eyes \n I shake and my skin burns hotter \n Red as the pounding blood in my veins \n Gold as the reflected sunlight at my feet \n Earth and fire, Sun and water \n It drips from the ends of my hair \n Flows over the tops of my toes \n And just like that, he touches me \n \"Beautiful,\" he says."}
{"text": "Welcome to Hell. \n Yes, Breton, Virginia is Hell on Earth where all the criminals and murderers are placed to face their demise at the hands of Vampyres: the judges of morally right and wrong. \n I have to say after having just finished this novel, I found myself speeding through the rest of the pages to read the Epilogue - and I need to know what happens next. \n This was a delightful take on the Vampire genre. And as a good fan of Vampires, I have to say, Ronald Andres Moore's Vampyres are a fresh take on, what I feel, Vampires have always been at their core: Creations for a purpose beyond themselves. Whether it be to take blood for the sake of surviving, or, in this case, existing to dish out justice to those deserving of it (and sometimes not). \n Which leads me to the colorful cast of characters. Here we have a vast (and I mean vast) collection of characters that fill this claustrophobia-inducing novel with their differences. Even the town itself is a character, a low hanging cloud of amnesia hovering just above its mostly derelict buildings. \n I don't want to give too much away, so I won't, but our heroes vary greatly from an amnesiac Vampyre named Michael, to a cast of (IMO) fiery orphans who have known nothing but their existence in the stifling town, to a renowned Vampyre Hunter with numerous tricks up his sleeve, an assassin, and two English Gentlemen, not to mention the various women that take up the fight to the soul suckers. \n At its core NOCTURN is a tale. Simply put. A riveting tale of that morally gray area we humans always seem to dwell within. It asks the question, \"What would happen if we got rid of our criminals and placed them within a town away from the good?\" And it answers that question with a roaring romp through darkness, blood, and gore. Those that created this town are the wrong ones, but we can hardly spare a feeling for them because we're so swept up in the varying characters's dilemmas as they come to terms (slowly) with the fact this town that always exists in one year, is not all it appears to be. (But we feel rightly justified when everyone wakes up and takes the fight to those in charge.) \n The baddies in NOCTURN are a slew of Vampyres, many of which, I'll be honest, I can't name right now, but I do remember Isaac, Rurk, and of course, Ruthven, a brilliantly crafted Vampyre that has lived far too long - so long he's let his power corrupt him to the point he's oblivious to any notion of humility - it's not for him, you see. \n There's so much I can say about this novel, from it's origin of the Vampyres (they're Nephilim), to the different fantastic creatures that all descend from mothers of ancient (dark) lore, to the awesome characters, and the world that existed in this one town. \n Mr. Moore has created a riveting tale that I believe any fan of Vampires (they're vicious, just like I like 'em), historical fiction, claustrophobic horror, suave Van-Helsing-type Vampyre Hunters, and the little orphan inside us all will enjoy greatly. \n I greatly await the next installment in this series. Mr. Moore has crafted the Vampire story I didn't know I wanted to read. But I do now, and that's all that matters. \n Keep your bite, Mr. Moore. \n You're a blessing to the Vampire genre."}
{"text": "As a child, I read another edition of the Arabian Nights, however I don't think I really appreciated it until now. Maybe it was the selection of the tales, however this time I really enjoyed the adventures. Many of the tales were humorous, in particular Sinbad's various exploits. The stories had the lure of the ancient worlds of Bagdad, Persia and China with lots of mystique and magic tied with a morale to be learnt at the end. They are not \"fairy tales\" as they don't always have happy endings, but definitely \"just\" endings. It is marketed as a children's fiction, but I don't know how appropriate that maybe as they are so many incidences of beheading, and maneating etc. My favourite tales were \"the Story of the Envious Man and of Him who was Envied\", \"the Voyages of Sindbad the Sailor\" (all of them), \"The Little Hunchback\" and \"the Story of Ali Cogia, Merchant of Bagdad\". All in all lots of fun and adventure."}
{"text": "Avian begins where Fledgling left off--literally with Jaevid in the same scene still reluctantly riding home for the three month interlude. Jaevid returns to find Katty with another boy (another blacksmith!) named Bren and his childhood home abandoned. Katty lives up to her name early on, and it's clear she has complicated feelings for Jaevid, who has no desire to relate or reconnect with his childhood friend. \n Jaevid learns wood-working, finds a mysterious sword, and a note from his brother, who's now an infantry man at the front. These things (and Mavrik's company) keep Jaevid from spiraling into self-loathing angst. Jaevid can't indulge carpentry forever because an urgent letter from Beckah prompts him to go help her, Sile, and her family. Jaevid finds Icarus chose Beckah to be a dragon rider, and even though women aren't allowed to go to the academy, Beckah is determined to learn, but things take another turn for the urgent when Sile's wife nearly dies during pregnancy. She's saved by Jaevid, who triggers a series of new Eleven powers, including super-healing and initiating his own growth spurt into adulthood. \n Then, the dreams begin...dreams that aren't part of Jaevid's memory. He sees his mother, who talks to him while a mysterious Elf kills the king. At the end, there's a lone soldier, and for most of the novel, Jaevid wakes up here. The dream begins to impact Jaevid's life at the academy, and he knows the plot on Sile's life extended all the way to the king. Jaevid knows his dreams are connected, but he's struggling to survive his second year at the academy, which includes rooming with his school nemesis, Lyon. \n I seriously never wanted to stop reading this book. The slight up-tick in pace, the logical growth in the characters were all great. There's so much that happens in this second book, and the biggest improvement is that everything feels a bit more organically rooted this time. Jaevid's relationships with Beckah and Sile are fleshed out, and Felix's incongruous attitudes become grounded in his family problems. \n The training was more practical this time. That has to do with Jace Rodin being an actual character instead of a last-minute stand in for Sile. The sadistic instructor, Thrane, pushes Jaevid to his limits. Thrane's a racist, and he gets to Jaevid by breaking Lyon's arm repeatedly and trying to goad Jaevid into a battle fever. \n Mavrik, Icarus, and Nova all have actual personalities. The dragons still aren't the main draw to this novel, but Icarus is a big-softy now. Mavrik has his own frustrations now; he's being trained to keep pace with Jace's dragon, Ghost, who is the fastest flyer among the dragon riders. \n The one plot I didn't like: Katty's. It felt like trying to avoid a love triangle. This worked a little bit because Jaevid becomes friends with Bren, Katty's new boyfriend. However, I still didn't quite get the sudden change in Katty's personality. I suppose that it could be explained because we're seeing the entire relationship through Jaevid's perspective, and he's clearly confused about Katty's actions as well. \n Beckah: a turn for the awesome. I liked her in Fledgling, but I loved her in Avian. Beckah's plot to become a dragon rider concludes awesomely. There was a scene with Beckah that I expected to go one cliche direction, but I loved her a thousand times more when that scenario was subverted. I don't want to say anything else more about that scene because it's worth it. For all the great moments Beckah gets in Avian, you should know where her plot with Jaevid is going. Jaevid and Beckah have 'forbidden romance' oozing from their pores, and it's a sweet romance. \n This book was exactly like I expected, and yet, refreshing and different. It grew out of the mold Fledgling provided. The academy is more dangerous, the mysteries behind the conspiracy feel like they matter, and Jaevid struggles with his new powers and strengths. Every character in this story feels like they belonged in this world more."}

{"text": "My first reaction when I finished this book: Imagine Brent Weeks had channeled Brandon Sanderson and you're halfway to knowing what kind of book this is going to be. McClellan has developed a magic system that is very reminiscent of allomancy - powder mages snort or consume gunpowder much like a cocaine addict, endowing them with powers physical and metaphysical. We also see magic in the more traditional sense (hand waving wizardry so to speak), Knacks (people with one off powers, X-menish but without the flair), all resting in a world we can almost recognize as being modeled after late 18th/early 19th century Europe. And like so many books I've stumbled into recently, a B plot centered around religion and gods. \n The initial hook for this book is the calling in of a retired investigator to solve a riddle left by a dead sorcerer at the end of the coup that brought down the King, spiraling out from there to include rogue magi, betrayal among the coup's conspirators, and a civil war. Good stuff, to say the least, and where McClellan might be faulted for a lack of depth, he more than makes up for by keeping the novel at a brisk and relentless pace that hurtles the reader to the conclusion of the first volume far too quickly. A little cliche, but a lot of fun to read, and yet another author/series to add to the queue."}

{"text": "This book just gutted me. Make no mistake, this book might be YA but it is hardcore. Days of Blood and Starlight is quite different from book one. This book is far more epic in scope, and decidedly darker. It is drenched in the horrors of war and presents a heart breaking, sophisticated and intense reckoning of the physical and psychological toll warfare takes on individuals and societies. It is a book with few clear heroes and villains and oodles of morally gray characters navigating impossible situations. \n Everything about this book worked for me. The characters were well drawn and developed organically, the plot was gripping, the writing was gorgeous, and it was both intellectually and emotionally stimulating. I was moved to tears by sections of this book. I can't wait for book three. The dramatic stakes are so high!"}

{"text": "Cress has been living alone in a satellite since she was seven. However, she dreams about earth, about helping Cinder and mainly about Thorne and his eyes. When Thorne goes to save her, Sybill and an official capture him and make the satellite fall, and try to capture Cinder and her ship. Sybill gets away, but she captures Scarlet to torture and interrogate in Luna, and Cinder gets stuck with Jacin, a guard that says is loyal only to the princess. Believing that Thorne is dead, Cinder has decided to find Dr Erland and start the plan to defeat Levana. She doesn't know Thorne and Cress are alive, and lost in the Sahara Dessert. And Kai has decided to marry Levana to stop the war and get the antidote. Cinder has to come up with a plan to stop the wedding and end Levana's reign once and for all. \n I didn't like Cress as much as Scarlet for mainly two reasons: the first one is that I just didn't like Cress herself. She was naive, a bit selfish, and really immature. Ii is to be expected after the way she grew up, isolated from every bit of human interaction, but still. I couldn't connect to her. And this was really sad because it made her story painful to read and her romance really forced. I love Thorne, he's one of the best characters in my opinion, but their adventure felt flat and childish compared to the others. The second reason was that nothing really happened in terms of plot development. It felt like a transition book, and they ended up really similar to where they started. I wish they had a different mission than kidnapping Kai, but hey, at least at the end it got interesting. The thing is, it's a really big book to read for just the final chapters. At least now Kai is on board, he knows everything about Cinder being princess Selene, and they are finally going to Luna. I was sad about Dr. Erland but not that much, and I assumed early on that Cress was his daughter. Is it too much of a coincidence? Definitively, but expected nonetheless. . Also, there was so little of Wolf that made me sad. I get that he's scared for Scarlet, but he should believe in her. And it also felt a bit like Twilight, like he can't live of function without his partner and becomes a walking zombie. And that kills the character for me."}

{"text": "I thought this book was cool because the adventure and journey throughout this book was entertaining. Rick Riordan never had a boring moment throughout the entire book and kept the reader on the edge of his or her seat. There was always something happening, every flip of the page and danger was eminent throughout. You can see the character develop throughout the book and brought the reader through a vivid maze of an adventure. Great book for anyone who is looking for an adventure and to follow a character who is trying to prove himself."}

{"text": "This was an interesting story; an interesting villain origin story. There were parts I really enjoyed, such as the tragedy of it and how they depicted Peter Pan as the villain, what a little butthead he was. This has always been a pet peeve of mine, how Peter Pan is glorified and this book paid tribute to the original story where Peter Pan is basically a little sh*t child kidnapper. \n I struggled with the repetitive nature of the story. It was a lot of back and forth with the same issues: to kill or not to kill Pan, to kiss or not to kiss Tiger Lily, etc. It felt like there was very little to move forward to, especially in parts two and three. \n Although, I appreciate the ending. How she remained true to the story and it really is a standalone. \n Conclusion: Don't Need to Buy"}

{"text": "I was in library school when the first Librarians movie came out, and while it was kind of silly fun, I never felt the urge to see any of the others. This book, the first of a tie-in series with the new Librarians TV show, was a lot of fun, if not anything profound. Trying to appeal to fans of both the movie series and the TV series, it alternates between a 2006 adventure with the original Librarian, Flynn Carsen, and a 2016 adventure of the new team. It wasn't clear at first how the two stories related together, but they finally did. All told, this novel was diverting enough to keep my attention on a recent plane trip, and I'd recommend it to fans of the movies and/or TV show. \n (Note: I received my copy of this book through a Goodreads First Reads giveaway.)"}

{"text": "3 stars \n While this book started out strong, it didn't continue without issues for me. Detective Charlotte (Cee Cee) Caissie is a member of New Orleans homicide team. She's working on a case in which bodies have had their throat and heart ripped out. She has a suspect in mind but proving it is another thing. My first issue with this is the crime seems to be glossed over. If something like this occurred, newspaper would run amuck with stories, and the people would 1) be scared out of their minds 2) demand answers from those who sworn to protect them. It seems minor but the procedural element in this book fell short for me. \n Then there's the MC, Max and Cee Cee. I liked them but their relationship didn't burn off the pages. Yes the heat was there but there's more to romance than just sex. While Max character seems like an alpha male at times, other times, he's lead by someone else on a leash, figuratively speaking. Max has been manipulated ever since his mom died and he's taken in by crime boss Jimmy Legere (who's also the man Cee Cee is going after). This is where I can understand why Max seeks out love and acceptance because very few know who and what he is. Max can turn from dangerous to what I call, childlike behavior the next. I can sort of understand that as his mental well being has been affected. Not knowing his father and losing his mother at a young age still affects him. Even though Jimmy regards him as family, it isn't in any sense as Max is used time and time again to do his bidding. \n Cee Cee, on the other hand, seems to run hot and cold, which bugged me quite a bit and I felt bad for Max. The other issue I had is where was her supervisor in all this? Crimes are happening yet there seems to be no control over anything. No one is being held accountable for their actions. The only voice of logic was Cee Cee's partner. Again, may seem minor but I need to believe it! \n There were some interesting and revealing moments, but there were also moments where it plateaued out. I get that this is a paranormal romance, but in order for me to buy in to the story, other elements should be plausible. \n As these two characters story spans 4 books, I will continue on, but I'm hoping there's much more character progression as well. I do like the way Ms Gideon writes, it's just the execution that left me wanting more in this one."}
{"text": "This book is pretty sweet. It covers three very interesting historical periods (a bubonic plague outbreak in 1627, Jack the Ripper's rampage, and latter WWI in addition to the sections set in the present) and it is beautifully written. The style is just gorgeous and the author supplies the perfect amount of historical information. I loved all the information on old time medicine. \n I was planning on giving this book 5 stars for awhile, I was that impressed by it, but it does have some flaws that keep it from reaching that level. The through line that connects the three historical vignettes and the present is the pursuit of protagonist Bess by the man who initiated her into witchcraft, the wicked Gideon. Gideon is underdeveloped as a character, as is Bess's relationship to him. This makes the conclusion underwhelming. \n Thankfully this book has enough going for it that I can still strongly recommend it despite this problem. I look forward to reading more from this author."}

{"text": "I can't put to words what I felt when I was reading this book, but I can tell you that what you've seen on the TV adaptation of this marvelous novel is exquisitely true-to-the-book. \n Ok, I guess somehow I have to say a little something about this read. First of all, this is an epic fantasy book. I can't fathom Martin's imagination; zombies, frozen wastelands, a cunning queen with a cruel son, a twisted plot, a smart dwarf, a young fighter, dragons; everything's here. Though it's a long read and it will really take all your time to finish through the end, it is worth it. \n I especially love Daenerys' flow of story. Every time I near through the end of a character's POV, I almost always wish that it's Daenerys' turn. I love how her life turned upside down. She's becoming stronger as each page past, even Viserys can't contain how huge her authority had grown. I was just saddened that Drogo had that fate (though I already knew what will happen). She's my favorite character in the book. \n Another character I fancy is Tyrion Lannister, the imp. He's wise and can't be fooled and those are the features that make him stand out. I adored the moment when he was about to be executed on the Eyrie by Lysa. Thinking about that trial by combat - wow. I look forward for more interesting scenes of Tyrion when I read the second book soon. \n Although Arya is headstrong and naughty, I also liked her character, because unlike Sansa, her eyes weren't blinded by the truth. She was smart, too, having to escape the castle when Lord Eddard was captured by Lannister men. \n Overall, the flow of the book wasn't confusing at all. It was well written and the story was just divine. It's a masterpiece that the author should be really proud of. I can't wait to read the second book, A Clash of Kings, and I can't wait for the season 3 of its TV adaptation. \n This is seriously a 5 out of 5 stars for me."}
{"text": "This is the teenage werewolf book I've been wanting to read. It's not perfect, and in some parts it's a little confusing, but this is an enjoyable read for those who want a werewolf book that's actually about werewolves. Colin is a boy living with his misanthropic grandma, and he thinks he's a huge loser (and maybe he is, but maybe it's just a high school thing). Colin gets bullied relentlessly at school by Gareth & Co. This is when he decides to run away, but there's a werewolf plus a car attack that gets in the way. He hallucinates a lot, and I liked the instant post-bite action. None of that waiting a month for the next full moon here. \n I like the awkward teen vibe Colin has going for him. It's not forced. There's a definite Teen Wolf vibe to Colin's transformation. It's fast/immediate. Colin has a friend (seriously, a single friend), and I guess part of the point is that he doesn't really like or know anyone at school. This gives Colin's character a feeling of isolation early on. He could've used a wacky friend. \n There's clearly something going on with Becca and her dad, Mr. Emerson, early on. Becca's secret comes out later, and there are several mysteries surrounding people in this book that get dropped all together towards the end. You might guess the big secret, but you might not. It's a standard enough paranormal twist, but there's a certain level of confusion as to what is going on between different people in this story that it made me uncertain where it would resolve itself. A little surprise: not a bad thing. \n Creepy dude, creepy dude, who are you? Silas Baxter, werewolf and werewolf hunter. There's quite the conspiracy happening. It 100% involves Becca's father, and that's obvious. I wanted him to ultimately become more likable throughout the book, but Mr. Emerson never does. What kind of relationship does Becca have with her father? We never really find out. There's a lot of strange people in Elkwood--the twins, Garth, Becca, her dad, Colin's grandma. It feels like everyone else is in on this conspiracy except Colin. (And they are.) That's okay, because Colin finds out soon enough what's happening, and this story never makes you wait too long to get to the interesting parts. \n Link to the blog review"}

{"text": "4 Intrigued Stars! \n Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Intermix/Penguin Group \n I think it's ingenious to have a paranormal spin off come off a contemporary romance series. Brilliant. I'm not totally sure what's going on yet with this series as the novella was setting the stage sort of speak into a new supernatural underworld. In this novella there are a few parallel stories going on. \n We have where the Emersons are in Florence at the Uffizi Gallery to donate Gabriel's beloved Dante collection. \n We have the subplot of the origins of these paintings and how they originally disappeared. \n We have the ongoing love story of the Emerson's but with a twist that makes me uneasy with this great couple. \n We also have the supernatural world arising and a war on the horizon after the Prince of Florence had an attempted assassin on him. Now we don't know how the war is going to go and who to trust. \n Even though I'm a bit clueless I'm completely intrigued how this new series is going to play out and how the subplots are going to be resolved. \n The idea of the series is genius, now my fingers are crossed that it lives up to its potential. \n For more reviews, visit Live Read and Breathe \n Like us on Facebook Live Read and Breathe Facebook \n Follow along with Twitter Live Read and Breathe Twitter"}
{"text": "I really like this series. I'm assuming it to be a series. This is the third installment of The Cemetary of Forgotten Books collection. I read the second book, Angel's Game, first. I picked it up out of the library of a cruise ship about two years ago. It was just such a good story. It's has the literary element. It is set in Barcelona (one of my favorite cities.) A dark, gothic Barcelona. It's a love story. It's a mystery. Many mysteries. And so on. Fun stuff. So then I read the first book of the series, Shadow of the Wind, which is actually a prequel to the second. If that makes any sense. And The Prisoner of Heaven is the third. But hopefully not the final. There is still a lot more story to be told I think. I will be waiting eagerly for the next installment. Carlos Ruiz Zafon is a master story teller. Well done."}

{"text": "When I saw The Deepest Night on NetGalley, I would like to say I was calm. Collected. Professional. \n But I'd be lying. \n I squealed, requested it, and then obsessively checked my emails for an approval notice like a rabid dog frothing at the mouth, slobbering and waiting for something to attack. So when the approval showed up I dropped everything, and read. \n And now I'm sad, and wish I hadn't read it quite as fast... because the experience is over, and I have to wait for the next book. Just like Jesse stays with Lora, The Darkest Night will stay with me, but it isn't quite the same. \n Shana's words are so magical, and musical they are really a divine delight to read. I find that when I'm reading her stories, the plot really takes a backburner to the pleasure of simply immersing myself in her prose. And her characters are so captivating, so vivid, I can't help forget this is fiction, not reality. \n The characters we adored in The Sweetest Dark are back - Lora, Sophie, Armand (Though he is definitely changing, not nearly as much of a jerk as he seemed at first in the first book) and in his own star-like way, Jesse. I was thrilled that he wouldn't totally be gone, because I really like him. What surprised me is how much Armand is growing on me. I am usually very against love triangles, but in this case I really do love both Armand and Jesse, and I don't blame Lora a bit for being a bit torn between the two. Heck, I'm torn between the two. \n The main characters are all so noble, and so selfless. If we didn't have Chloe to be a selfish brat, I'd think the entire cast a little too perfect. Fortunately, Chloe hasn't changed in the least, so not to worry. \n The plot here only had one major surprise, and I cannot tell you what it is of course, but I think it will startle you as much as it startled me and Lora. This book is more about the character's journey after the aftermath. Armand is dealing with the fallout from his father's episode. Lora is sucked into the fallout from his Reginald's episode. It is about to be the summer break, and Lora isn't sure where she will go since she can't remain at Iverson (and isn't even sure if she can come back.) Jesse is no longer living, which tortures all the characters in their own way. One of the most poignant parts is when Mandy tells Lora he'd give her anything she wanted, but the only thing she wants is the one thing he can't give her. \n I will definitely re-read this book just for the pleasure of going through the feelings of the characters again, and for the delight of sinking into Shana's world. The Darkest Night might be a bit sweeter than The Sweetest Dark, and it definitely left me wanting more."}

{"text": "3.5 Stars for this erotic paranormal romance. \n Well! I wasn't sure what to think about this one from the blurb. I mean, how does a ghost woo a woman? I was delightedly surprised! \n Okay, from the start we learn how worthless Sage is as a boyfriend. He has all the looks and all the money, and he's a manipulative SOB intent on \"moulding\" (\"molding\" for the US readers) Grace into the woman he could imagine marrying. See, she's curvy, with long auburn hair, and has little education. Sage likes how biddable Grace is however, so he's eager to re-make her into a waifish gal with a pixie haircut and a knowlegde of culture. Yeah. Class a Jerk-off, IMHO. \n Still, Grace stays with him, because, well, she doesn't have anyone else. Her family's all gone and Sage is a beautiful, successful doctor. He's a great catch, and he doesn't stray-even if he is WHOLLY awful in bed. Grace has had eight months of once-weekly, planned and scheduled, unsatisfying smexytimes. \n A bit down on herself and her life, Grace opens a few bottles of wine and invites her BFF Amy over for a gal's night. Amy brings along a Ouija board and they play a game-summoning the spirit named Breece. Drunk and silly, Grace challenges \"Breece\" to show himself. And, he does. \n Breece had been killed by a hit-and-run accident while jogging. He has no idea how, or why, he's been summoned into Grace's life, but he's not sad that she's a voluptuous woman. At first he's only a tactile spirit, meaning he can touch and be felt, so he takes a bit of advantage of the drunken Grace. She thinks she's having a fantastic sex dream of imagined Roman warrior Breece, meanwhile ghostly Breece is shagging her six ways from Sunday. \n She learns this the second time-when he takes her in the shower, with a most unSagelike passion. Sage, for his part, thinks Grace is bonkers, and a sex fiend, and arranges her to have a psychiatric evaluation. \n Breece is insatiable, and Grace is sex-starved, so they make a great pair, excepting Breece's undead state. Grace wants to keep up the front with Sage, if only to not be \"alone\" but Breece's attachment is growing steadily stronger-and turning Grace's heart into a pretzel. It doesn't help how caustic Sage is. \n I spent a lot of time loving Breece, liking Grace and hating Sage, which was, I'm sure, by design. This triad isn't meant to be a triangle, however, and Grace FINALLY makes the right choice, only to have more heartache. The end was expected, but not less satisfying. I think readers will cheer on the reunited lovers, and the fun twist at the end really made me smile. \n Lots and lots of fun smexytimes, some barely adequate sexual relations, and one horse's pa-toot of a boyfriend made this one memorable."}
{"text": "I read this in one day. Enchanting or maybe Haunting - a good quick read. I wouldn't really classify this as YA book."}
{"text": "I only found out a week ago that the author of this series and the author of Tempting The Best Man is just one person. Holy crap. That explains why she's really good at the love story. \n What I like about this book, are the characters. Especially, Kat. She's not your typical teenage, angst-ridden heroine. She's not annoying (not much. Haha) She doesn't go on and on about how ugly she is. She mocks the instalove books. And she's a book geek. \n I like Daemon. Though, I can't say that I love him. He's still a jerk. But a hot one. A real hot-jerk. I think I like him better than Jace of The Mortal Instruments. He's more..alive and mysterious. Despite his arrogance, he's still charming and sweet. Most arrogant male characters are trying too hard to be haughty that it's not funny anymore. But Daemon? He's natural. He's also a hero. Seriously. I rarely feel the 'hero-ish' vibe on a character. But every time Daemon appears Especially when Kat and Blake are fighting and Dee and Adam's with her, I just really teared up a bit that he came. I'm so relieved because I know that it's okay now. Daemon's here. Finally. it's like everything will be okay. He's really a hero. And now I'm rambling. Sorry. \n But I'm really sad that 75% of the book is..null. Shame. But at least it picked up at 25%. Daemon and Kat's conversation also ends up like Daemon hinting that Kat needs protection, then Kat saying she's not, she's strong and all that crap, and then Daemon, will say softly that he knows she isn't and he will dramatically storm off the house. (Drama queen, much?) Though that's really annoying, I still can't make myself like him any less. He's just so...ugh. I also think that the events are very predictable and non-thrilling. But. But. But I can't seem to care. IDK. \n My favorite scene: \n The video blog part. UGhHHHHH it was just too darn cute and sweet. I can so imagine it in real life. KAShdak;lsdhas. Daemon, you adorable arse! \n What is this series doing to me?!"}
{"text": "Madison, the protagonist and narrator in Rebecca Chastain's A Fistful of Evil, possesses an ability she calls \"soul-sight\", with which she can switch her vision to see people and the world from a different view and perspective literally. \n When Madison switches to soul-sight or Primordium, she sees people's souls and life force. Every person's good or bad deeds give them a colour, a particular shade of white, grey or black. \n Madison does not like her ability, after a sad experience in her teens, and wishes she could forget about it or get rid of it. However, while searching for a job, she finds herself part of the world of Enforcers and evil-fighting. \n Narrated in the first person from Madison's perspective, A Fistful of Evil has a lot of sarcasm, owing to Madison's character, making the humour element ever-present in the novel. One of the thoughts that come to her is after starting her new job and having to buy a phone. She says/thinks \"A cell phone yesterday. A video conference today. Watch out, world. I might get a Twitter account next!\" \n What I also truly loved about A Fistful of Evil is the fact that it does not have a love story or that the romantic element is neither the centre nor is even in the periphery. Madison and her best friend Bridget do talk about men and Madison has a crush on several, however, there is no romance in the novel. Applause to Rebecca Chastain for that. \n All the characters in the novel are well-crafted and loveable. Even the demon, one cannot seem to hate him entirely. Rose is funny, flirty and helpful. She is also the one who \"babysits\" Madison at first. One of the funny scenes I enjoyed was this: \n \"Mr. Pitt snorted. He redirected his gaze to Rose. \"Make sure she doesn't do anything stupid.\" \n \"That's above my pay grade.\" \n A Fistful of Evil shows Madison's character as it grows, falters and gets up again. Madison has several moments of revelation, of light and realisation, that lead her to her decision as to whether she wants to accept her soul-sight and become an Enforcer or not. It is also the little things that make us great people, as both Madison and the reader realise and as Chastain so beautifully reveals it. \n There are many beautiful lines, images and scenes in the novel. One of them has Madison contemplating and weighing right and wrong when doing good; how much wrong or rule-breaking is a person allowed to do in order to do good? \n \"I may not be proud of my job history, but I'd never committed a crime before, let alone a crime in the name of my job. Then again, I'd never done anything as important as battle evil. My other jobs had been meaningless or boring--often both. At least as an enforcer, I was positively influencing the very balance of good and evil. That had to outweigh the minor transgressions I'd made along the way, right?\" \n Imagery is an important aspect in the novel and Chastain is highly lauded for her choice of imagery and humour. A favourite is the funny and realistic \"But there was nothing like a hound of death on my heels to give me an Olympian-worthy boost.\" \n Also, \"The horror reel played out in my head, with the hosts scattering across the continent, then the world, a pandemic of evil\" is a highly visual image. \n Also, when she was scantily dressed, she thought to herself: \"embarrassment came complete with its own heating system.\" \n After battling a demon and nearly dying, Niko - also known as \"Mr. Dark and Deadly\" - takes Madison to refuel or \"recharge\" her energy, which includes having something to eat. One can proudly say that they will look at green salads differently after reading this novel. \n \"Niko selected Cobb salads for both of us--without bacon!--plus four large sides of grilled vegetables. \n Screw that. I'd almost died tonight. I deserved something better than rabbit food.\" Later, Niko explains why it is important to eat greens and why Madison's comfort food of fries and a milkshake do nothing to fill her up or recharge her energy. \n Overall, A Fistful of Evil is an enjoyable, quick-paced fantasy novel. It's fun, it's different and it makes you think. \n It is the first instalment in the series and I look forward to reading the second part."}

{"text": "There are two critical factors that must be considered here: \n 1.) I have my Hogwarts-coloured glasses on so I'll be inherently biased towards anything Harry Potter. \n 2.) I've always like fanfiction. ;) \n Makes sense that I'd adore Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. Everything I've wanted to happen has happened in the post-Deathly Hallows years: Hermione's Minister of Magic, Albus and Scorpius are like the mini versions of Harry and Draco but this time they're friends and yada yada yada. Then everything that I didn't want to happen happened: I didn't think Draco would be that much of a \"grieving mess,\" I just wanted Harry and him to be friends. \n Is that too much to ask?!?! \n Also, I'm disappointed with how Cedric Diggory's character was presented. But even that wasn't as bad as that now infamous Trolley Witch incident (kind of like Jar Jar Binks in the Star Wars franchise, right? \n I also feel like J.K. Rowling traversed the darkest depths of Tumblr, came back up with the most child-friendly ideas and pandered to the hungry Harry Potter readers. Wait, why am I complaining? Pander on, Ms Rowling, I do enjoy your work. \n Although I'd prefer if you do it in proper book format rather than a play format. That was damn hard to read."}
{"text": "I came into this book series late -- I was nearly an adult when I cracked open the cover of this book. Reading it, though, made me feel like a child again. This is one of the few book series I hate to put down as I read at night. I will literally keep going until my eyes droop, no matter how late it is. \n Reading this book after finishing the series, I can see where Rowling lays the groundwork for everything to follow. Some of it is less than obvious, such as Harry's observations that there are times he suspects Snape might be a mind-reader. Even the Sorting Hat's attempt to place him into Slytherin takes on an entirely new meaning after the final book. \n My encouragement is -- if you've read this series only once, read it again. If you've never read it, read it. Get lost in it. Laugh over it. Cry with it. Rowling is a best-seller, and one of the greatest childrens' authors of our time for a reason. \n If you're a Christian and hesitant about \"the magic,\" toss your reservations out the window. You'll be dumbfounded at the Narnia-esque symbolism spread throughout the books. (There's a reason J.K. Rowling can't resist picking up a Lewis book, and she pays homage to him here in a multitude of little ways only those familiar with Narnia will understand.)"}

{"text": "I really, really wanted to like this one. I got about half way and almost abandoned this crap book which I am now dubbing \"Titanic 2\" aka \"Epic Fail\". However, I kept going, holding close to that small glimmer of hope I had that this book would turn around at some point and, I don't know, stop sucking?! Alas, it did not. \n After 500+ pages I am stuck in some wtf?! coma. I don't understand how this, what seemed like, amazing story with unique premise and interesting blurb, turned into some horrible train wreck 50%-60% in. \n I liked the set up. Emo guy, cheerleader girl. Polar opposites brought together by an outside opposing force. I liked the Poe angle, I mean who doesn't like something a little dark and twisted every now and again?! \n We all know that these two were going to end up together at some point...if you didn't, you're a moron. Even knowing this, I really wanted to hear their story...I wanted to see how Creagh was going to push these characters to abandon their own social judgements and personal insecurities in order to connect. What can I say, I like that sappy stuff. \n What I hated was almost everything. Isobel...holy balls...I have never wanted to strangle/maim/smack a character more than I do her. She was vapid, lied constantly, a wildly irrational decision maker, and just pissed me off. \n The Storyline was good up until the class project was due. After that, it was a slow, painful decline to ShittyStoryVille. Was it a unique reality/story Creagh created? Yes. I'm all for originality, especially in this genre. I guess it was just so out-there for me and that's why I didn't like it. I did, however, like Varen, even though that has to be the worst possible name ever....no wonder he's Emo. And, I liked Gwen. Her dialogue was pretty hilarious. \n I just plain hated this book. It wasn't the most horrible thing I've read. It just disappointed. The pacing was slow and I think that added to my displeasure even more. I might be in the minority on this one, but I really had to push myself to even finish it. It had the potential, but just died and became ridiculous to point of just plain stupid."}

{"text": "The Sweetest Dark is a deeply emotional, unexpected treasure. \n I connected to Lora almost instantly. Not the things she saw, but just her raw, jagged edges. She is a tortured soul and I think most of us have felt that way at some point or other. Early in I desperately wanted to see her rise above her circumstances, put her twisty past behind her, and become more than another tragedy, another forgotten girl. \n For so long she heard the voice inside her, but was told she was crazy until she believed them. And then, when finally someone told her that she wasn't, it was like he offered her salvation. I cried for her loved how it turns out that she isn't the bottom of the lowest of the low. Instead, she is one rare, precious being. \n This book is almost entirely devoid of action, and almost even devoid of a plot. But yet I loved it. It felt like a reflective journey that was completely character driven. There were no real tension filled events dragging me through the story, but yet I couldn't put it down. The character is riveting and raw. \n This story is dark. If you aren't in the mood for that, this isn't the right tale. Beneath Shana Abe's beautiful language and amazing imagery, lies a bittersweet tragedy. \n I was so impressed with this book that I'd like to read more of the author's Drakon series. It looks like they may all be loosely connected."}

{"text": "This started off really well. The premise and mythology is very original, the characters are all memorable, and Maggie Stiefvater nails the multiple perspectives. The characters actually feel like teenagers, something a surprising number of YA novels fail to accomplish. Plus, there are more than a few moments where she really sings as a writer. \n My biggest problem is the whole second half. Sure it is pretty exciting and has some great scenes. However, there is no resolution to almost anything. This is my biggest problem with series. They are so focused with future installments that they forget to make a solid, satisfying first book. Harry Potter is a good example of a book that doesn't have this problem. Each novel works independently, introducing and concluding their individual stories while continuing the overall narrative. This novel's climax solves nothing from what was introduced in the beginning. It's just lazy storytelling. \n I am going to give this series another go and read the next book. Hopefully it will pick up the slack of this one while keeping everything that works."}

{"text": "In the city of Tharios, far to the south of her home, fourteen-year-old Trisana Chandler is facing two problems. The first is that she has acquired a student -- a journeyman glassmaker named Kethlun Warder -- who is not only several years older than she, but is afraid of her lightning magic; a serious problem since it turns out he carries such power himself. The second is the serial murders of several female entertainers in one of the city's poorer districts. Tris and Keth struggle with the rudiments of glass- and lightning-magic, and work to shape their powers to help Demakos Nomasdina, the man in charge of the murder investigation. Tris has difficulty accepting the harsh class-structure of this new land, and acquires two more responsibilities: A glass dragon created by her student and named Chime, and a four-year-old girl named Glaki who is orphaned by the killer.

{"text": "A lush, sensual, erotic and suspenseful story that is at once poignant and dangerous. Another must-read from.SR and easily one of my top reads of 2015!! \n To say that I was ecstatic to read this book is an understatement. \n The Raven has everything I love about Sylvain Reynard's writing and more. Lyrical, erotic, sensual and mysterious, The Raven begins another addictive series with the introduction of Raven and the Prince. This book is a must-read!! \n Professor Emerson and his wife do appear here, but Raven and the Prince are themselves insanely fascinating. Even if you are not a huge fan of paranormal stories, this book is a must read for the thrilling story and lush, intensely sexual scenes. We are introduced to the Prince, leader of the City of Florence, who is at once cold and calculating but beautiful in his own right. He cannot stay away from Raven and feels compelled to help her again and again. He sees in her virtue and goodness, and she awakens long-dormant feelings that he never believed he could have, even at his own peril. \n \"I'm afraid that trouble is not what you do. Trouble is what you are.\" \n Raven is an unlikely heroine and I fell in love with her! She is damaged goods, inside and out, and her painful history is hinted at and then ultimately explained. She is an extremely sympathetic character and I cannot wait to read more about her in the next book. The Prince, too, is surprised at his attraction to her; might she lead him to redemption and true love? \n \"In many ways, we are the most perfect match. We see each other as we are, but neither of us views the other as broken.\" \n I am not articulate enough to adequately describe the virtues of this book! Part art history lesson, part paranormal romance, part erotica, it is a must read for all fans of Gabriel's Inferno - and even for those readers new to the series. This book can be read as a standalone but is best understood after having read the GI series. The Raven is engrossing, suspenseful, sexy and and yes, humorous. Do not miss this book! And while it has a a fabulous conclusion, there is much, much more to come for these characters and I cannot wait for more!! \n Favorite quote: \n \"You are my greatest virtue and my deepest vice.\""}

{"text": "I received this book via Goodreas' Don't Buy My Love Program. \n 4.5 Stars for this richly textured, dystopian epic. \n The future world, as described in Outlier, is a mix between Xmen, and Hunger Games--without the games. There is one main city, Atlas, which is large and filthy, a hardscrabble life, segregated into wards. The Lifted City is exactly what it sounds like, a city built on a platform thirty stories in the air, upon which the ruling class lives, including the King and the wealthy. The lowborn can only hope to ascend to the Lifted City by means of Legacies. (here's where the Xmen link comes in!) Everyone in Atlas has a Legacy, some extra sensory ability that is manifest within them. All children are tested for legacy, and those who have powerful ones may be brought into the Court, either to amuse or serve, as needs be. Persons who have dangerous or extremely rare legacies are at risk of being named an Outlier, and (currently) subject to experimentation or destruction. Another aspect of life in Atlas is that no one sleeps past the age of two, hence, no one dreams. \n The story mainly revolves around the family of Wick Lesser, who is an Outlier, because Wick is 17, and Wick sleeps. He dreams, which is unheard of, and some of his dreams appear to become reality. His family hides his secret, but Wick has another secret, the desire for a male mate--one he continues to see in his dreams. Wick gets caught up in a rebel group, Rain, that is opposed to the current king, and wishes for a more egalitarian life. Wick and his fellow Raindrops *snort* are committing treason just by associating, but nothing prepares Wick for the night when part of Lifted City falls, and the nightmare he has been seeing for nights actually occurs in real life. Wick meets the boy of his (literal) dreams, and rescues this fallen Highborn, Athan, from the rubble. \n The story then moves forward with more rebellion, of a sort, and the brutal Guardian troops quelling discord in the slums of Atlas. Athan and Wick experience their first love, but this is completely downplayed. The story is in the struggle, the avoidance of capture. Wick knows that by not turning over Athan immediately, he'll be arrested for kidnapping. That alone will be a capital offense. Athan doesn't want to leave Wick, or the slums of Atlas--he has always dreamed of a life here, and cannot believe the luck of finding such a loving partner; his own family is cold and unloving. \n This is is an epic book with 10 or so viewpoints. I found it a fascinating read, though the story is really more the congealing of forces prior to the fight. All the players have been moved into positions on the chessboard, so to speak, and the next book promises explosions and uprising (in both rebellion and rising into the Lifted City). For all that this book is named Rebellion, it is really more rebellious in the sense of discontent and rabble-rousing than actual political/military action. That is not to say I didn't enjoy it--I very much did. I'm simply defining the terms, because this is not a war book. \n The romance between Wick and Athan was a bit sweet, but not too intense. There are also scenes of love between Wick's parents who are delightfully smitten after 25 years of marriage. Wick's family is a close-knit one, and I truly enjoyed their interactions. Unfortunately, they are in conflict by the end of this book, but I have high hopes for reconnection."}
{"text": "I've come to a stage where reading has become a means of procrastination from work... That's why right now , I tend to stick to Light easy reads rather than deep thought provoking ones. In accordance to this, Being Jamie Baker by Kelly Oram, couldn't have been a more perfect choice for me. Although the story does tackle some rather dark and depressing issues, the on-going humour and light-hearted atmosphere balances it out, so that the reader was not left in tears... \n Before reading this book, I have to admit I didn't read the blurb at all so I honestly had no idea what I was getting myself into . I found that the story itself was quite unpredictable and original in a sense that I truly was left wondering what would happen next multiple times and the ending did take me a lot by surprise. In the first couple of pages I was initially surprise at how casually the author brings up Jamie's ' Superpowers' ( like I said before, I didn't read the blurb) . I had no clue, and it was intertwined with the story so casually and sudden that I didn't really question the 'science' behind it all and how believable it actually was. \n Reading this book , I couldn't help but compare the story to ' Shatter Me ' . The connections were definitely there,. Girl with superpowers 'check', She can't touch people, check , dream boy who helps her through all this, check. I must say I did enjoy the characters in this book more than shatter em . Honestly I am a sucker for strong female character rather than extremely dependant ones. I found that the Jamie and Ryan had a lot more depth than ( insert lead female of shatter)And(insert lead male of shatter me ) And their relationship actually developed in front of the readers rather than the whole ' they love each other because I say so' approach. Okaaay... I don't want to turn this into a Shatter Me review or anything . In Being Jamie Baker , the readers really get a thrill in seeing the progress between Jamie and Ryan as well as them coming into terms with themselves. I really enjoy Kelly Oram's romance writings , its not cliche and definitely not romance for the sake of romance... \n Overall I enjoyed this book and will be looking for ward to the next one in the series. \n 4 stars , it was great yes, but not quite a 5 star book \n sorry for the sucky review :)"}

{"text": "This is a very strong YA urban fantasy, bringing a contemporary twist to the Camelot story. \n Morgan La Fay is a fire user, a fact her father has tried to hide her entire life. Morgan's mother, Morgause, was executed a decade before for the murder of her husband--while in self-defense--but no one would hear Morgan's testimony. It seems that Morgan's father wasn't Morgause's husband, and Morgause took great pains to keep Morgan's identity secret. \n Still, Morgan has a lot of anguish over losing her mother, and she's unhappy about the restrictions placed on all magic users in the realm. She wants to be the Maven, or head magic user charged with protection of the next king, Arthur. As Maven, Morgan would use her power to help magic users have a better life. \n Morgan auditions for a spot in Arthur's Round, the selection cycle for Arthur's Maven, and comes up against some talented magic users. Morgan and Guinivere, who has healing energy, become friends, but Morgan suspects something about water-user Merlin that isn't straight up. There are others, and the plot thickens when Morgan learns her mother was a member of the Luminary--a rogue group of magic users who attempted to kill King Uther, Arthur's father, fifteen years before. This attack resulted in the sweeping crackdown on magic use under which Morgan now exists. \n There are some definitely dangerous goings on, with Morgan sometimes smack in the middle of what appears a plot to incapacitate, or even kill, her. It also becomes clear that powers are working behind the scenes to promote Merlin ahead of Morgan--when Merlin doesn't even want to be Maven. Morgan struggles to figure out whom is responsible, and keeps coming up just short, but her determination and craft catapult her into the neck-and-neck race for Maven. \n There's significant mystery here. Morgan isn't a dishrag; she fights hard for all she believes, risking her very life to save others. The tension is real, though I sometimes felt the story jumped too fast. The end is a fierce resolution with plenty more story to tell...in the next book. \n I definitely would read on in this series. A great start with believable drama and well-crafted characters. Innocent, excepting, well, the grisly deaths of a couple baddies. So, safe for all ages."}
{"text": "Review originally posted on journeyintotheshleves.tumblr.com & journeyintotheshelves.wordpress.com \n **I received an eARC of this book courtesy of NetGalley and Tor. This has had no bearing on this review. \n Have you ever read a book that you just want to immerse yourself in and never leave? Every Heart a Doorway is one of those books. \n Every Heart a Doorway tells the story of the children who go on magical adventures through the wardrobe or fall down the rabbit hole after they come back to Earth. It's about the kids who journey from extraordinary to the mundane and can no longer cope. Returning home isn't easy, so these children go to Eleanor West's Home for Wayward Children, a place specifically made and meant for them, but this sanctuary may not be as safe as they hope. \n This book was incredible. I wish it was longer because I wanted to see more of this world that McGuire created; I wanted to dive into these characters and know what their lives were like before. I just wanted more. \n However, even though I wanted more, the book still felt whole. What we were given as readers was still enough to satisfy the wanting of a well-rounded cast of characters and a gripping plot that every reader wants when diving into a new book. \n The characters were well-rounded and very different from each other, which you could see, not only in the places that they went to, but their tone and manners of speaking. Each character, even minor background characters, had their own distinctive voice that added to this world McGuire has created. Not only that, but this book has an openly asexual and an openly transgender main characters where the plot of the book does not revolve around their sexuality, which was refreshing to read (because, like many, I am tired of books with LGBTQIA+ characters that are solely defined by their sexuality). \n Don't let the fantasy genre tag fool you, this book is a mystery. Despite it's short length, McGuire was able to get so much story and suspense squeezed onto every page that really brought this book to incredible heights. There are few mystery books that I've read where I didn't know or couldn't figure out who was the culprit (I blame watching too much Law and Order as a child), but this one had me guessing every step of the way. \n Overall, Every Heart a Doorway is a captivating, unique, and thrilling novel that delves into the psychology of those who are able to discover who their true selves are, and what may happen when that is all taken away."}
{"text": "This book was really a good fantasy book. I really enjoy reading this book since it has good story line and fast pace. I do enjoy reading about world building in this book because the author done a good job writing this book. \n This book is about a girl named Alina who have a power to help the world that she lived in. The character in this book was good and the plot twist is really awesome. \n I need to read the second book soon."}
{"text": "So I was really looking forward to reading this book. I was almost afraid to read it because I heard so many good things about it, that I didn't want to be disappointed. It definitely was not disappointing, it was really, really good:) It took a bit for it to get going in the beginning but once you got passed it, it was great! I absolutely LOVED The Time Traveler's Wife and it was really neat to read a young adult version of time traveling. Holly and Jackson had such a sweet romance and Jackson's desire to constantly protect her was just perfect. What girl wouldn't want that? It was really sad at times. Jackson and his dad really had to deal with some sad stuff. I'm really looking forward to the next book, the ending really left us hanging. Great read!"}

{"text": "This is a fantastic read. It's not a M/M romance, per se, but the beginning of one, perhaps. \n The action begins with Prince Damianos of Akelios being captured, stripped and bound as a pleasure slave to Prince Laurent of Vere. Akelios and Vere are enemy nations under a tentative truce since their last war 6 years ago. The decisive battle in this war was the one where both the king and first born son were killed, and Damianos had bested the prince in hand to hand combat on the field. Prince Laurent, only 13 at the time, was too young to take the crown and Vere has been held by the Regent king, Laurent's pedophilic and profiteering uncle. \"Damen\" as Damianos is dubbed, has been made a particular gift for Laurent--who at 20 years of age is ten months shy of his coronation--by Damen's half-brother who has unlawfully assumed control of Akelios. See, everyone thinks Damianos has died, tragically, allowing the crown to fall to the usurper. \n This is a taut political drama with plenty of intrigue. Laurent wants nothing to do with Damen. He hates all Akelians due to the loss of his father and brother in battle with them. He also hates his uncle, which this reader suspects has something to do with the Regent king's sexual proclivities and Laurent's own frigidity. \n This is not a romance. Damen is smart enough to understand that his life hangs in a very dangerous balance. Were any of the Veretians to learn his identity he'd be killed. In the meantime, Laurent spares little thought to brutalizing Damen. There is a wary respect that develops as Damen makes requests that confuse and intrigue Laurent, particularly regarding the disposition of two dozen Akelian pleasure slaves that languish in Vere. True to the insight of Tsun Su, one can expect that Laurent knows his life is also in a precarious position. Ten months remain until he takes the throne and it seems his uncle has played a very deep game to cement his further rule. \n This book is titled Volume One, and is part of a richly-written series. It ends with Damen and Laurent at a rapprochement. Laurent needs soldiers who will defend him against his uncle's schemes, and Damen knows that Laurent staying alive is the only thing keeping Vere from waging war on a divided Akelios. Keep you enemies closer, indeed."}
{"text": "I didn't know much about this book when I got it so didn't know what to expect but I have to say I really enjoyed it. At first when Ella was involved in an accident it was clear there was going to be some kind of eerie goings on but I never expected the way it turned out. \n I really liked Ella and Tristan even though Ella kind of annoyed me sometimes for over-reacting towards Tristan but their relationship was alot of fun. \n It left me looking forward to the next book with a cliffhanger ending like that, would definitely recommend this book!!"}
{"text": "I have to say, Myrnin was most defiantly my favourite character in this book! This sixth book picked up right after the ending in fifth-- Bishops in control and Claire and Michael are basically his ** SORRY FOR LANGUAGE** bitches. Its true, and it pisses me off and want to go into the book myself and kill Bishop myself! On a lighter note, Myrnin was amazing as usual, I even liked the little drama with his old \"friend\" ;) Ada. Well, maybe not a 'little' drama, but nonetheless, it was different and refreshing then the other drama with Bishop, which just made me want to punch a wall. This book kind of made me proud of the Morganville residents, the humans and vampires, yes AND the vampires sort of .. team up? to stop Bishop. READ READ READ, if you have read all the books, just read this one because this one cannot be missed!"}
{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n Solid 4 STARS. Would have been more if it weren't for some typos. My gosh, how do I review this? I couldn't put the book down and, even now, I want to start Saving Grace. These were $1.99 for the Kindle books. \n Grace has been punished for thousands of years--being thrust into bodies that were fighting losing battles. She has suffered so much pain for just one kiss with an angel, her angel. She has constantly been searcing for him on earth and saving her heart for only him. In this life, she has finally met her match in the body of Grace. She lives on for her, her brother Jacob and best friend Lea. \n When Grace meets Shane, she has lost all hope after losing Jacob to a long, torturous bttle with cancer. Shane is lighting a fire in her labido, but this faulty man could not be him. The sparks that fly and witty insults are definitely entertaining. Grace tries so hard to resist his charm and she fights the good that she sees in him the longer they spend time together, but can she give up her search for 'him' and give in to her desire for Shane? She is a stubborn one. \n MAJOR CLIFFIE!"}
{"text": "A really long book, it is nevertheless entertaining. Although I loved the series, there are some parts in this final book that disappointed me. Description of each of the battles in excruciating detail is often over done. Also, there are striking similarity between the plot details of this and Lord of the Rings. Just like Eragon went to collect the energies of Eldunari to win, Aragorn (in LOTR) had gone to the ghosts. Even the names Eragon and Aragorn are very similar. Having said that, it is quite natural and acceptable that this series was inspired by works like LOTR. \n One thing that I liked was the long wrap up to the series. Most of the authors just finish off with an epilogue, giving a hint of happy years that run into eternity. In this case however, a surprisingly large section of the book is dedicated to events that happen after the final battle. It gives a finial finish to the series and gives the sense of a much required closure."}
{"text": "4 Solid Stars !!! \n Well, that was a book journey. \n I'm aware some rreviews mentioned that it has similarities to other novels and couldn't stop comparing it-well let me say I didn't read books that were similar to Existence and I try to keep a free mind when I start reading a book. That's why I could enjoy the Crossfire series without thinking it's like 50Shades;just saying. \n I really enjoyed Pagan's and Death's journey through the book. Yeah sometimes i thought Pagan was a lil slow in getting hints but it was interesting figuring out why Death spared her and found her so 'interesting'. I still dont know exactly why but I assumethe second book will enlighten me ;) \n One thing I didn't like was the names... Come on, how can you name a hottie Dank??? o.O This name doesn't role smoothly LOL \n Anyways, I've already the following books on my Kindle and gonna start Predestined tonight or tomorrow (I've a serious book issue, I swear :p ). I'm curious what kind of path the story will take; I wanna read about Leif's reaction and hell yeah I wanna see how Pagan and Dank find a solution!!"}
{"text": "I enjoyed the book. It is what I would call a lighthearted read...one that is fun, a bit campy at times and easy to fall into. There are others who criticized the repetition of certain mannerisms of the characters (hands on the hips, etc.) but don't characters reflect real people and don't real people tend to have mannerisms that they repeat? At any rate, the book held my attention and was charming enough that I would like to read the next book. Perfect read for a snowy afternoon."}

{"text": "Robinson Crusoe on Mars. No, really. Mark Watney is struck by flying debris as he and the rest of his crew are packing up their Mars mission early due to a sandstorm. His shipmates believe that he is dead and, per protocol, leave him behind. Mark comes to and finds that himself stranded on a most inhospitable planet. No, really. Mars keeps trying to kill him. But Mark has mad survival skills and a lot of equipment that was abandoned by his mission. The author often lost me with the maps, math and science (which have been fact-checked and approved by NASA personnel) but the survival story is absolutely riveting. Most of the tale is told in the format of a journal kept by a man who believes he will probably die but intends to survive as long as possible in case someone can mount a rescue mission. The rest of the story occurs on mission control on Earth and on the spaceship that reluctantly abandoned their crew mate. This book had been on my Kindle for months. I decide that I should read it before seeing the movie. Now I can't wait to see Matt Damon recreate this wonderful, exciting adventure. Really."}

No longer the King's Assassin, she is the Queen of Terrasen and she has revenge to wreak on the King of Adarlan and his Valg army. But before she can avenge her parents' deaths, she must first get back her cousin Aedion from the King's clutches. To do that she needs to seek help from the last two people who would be willing to help her. Chaol - the King's former Captain of the Guard - and Arowyn - the King of Assassins who betrayed Aelin years ago and threw her into Endovier. She hasn't spoken to Chaol since he got her out of Rifthold and saw who she truly was and he has a lot to tell her. Starting with why he isn't the captain of the king's guard anymore and what exactly has happened to their mutual friend Prince Dorian. \n Arowyn, on the other hand, Aelin has plans for. She hasn't exactly forgiven him for all those years she was trapped in Endovier because of his betrayal and she hasn't forgiven him for what he did to Sam. Add in the fact that he has one of the Wyrdkeys that rightfully belongs to Aelin and things don't look all that good for the King of Assassins. On the other side of things, the King has something interesting up his sleeve that has to deal with the Valg princes - especially the one that now inhabits his son. Manon Blackbeak's story becomes even more intertwined with the rest of the Throne of Glass cast as she realizes just what kind of people her grandmother has allied themselves to. \n Okay, so I'll admit that after Heir of Fire I was desperate to get my hands on Queen of Shadows. Aelin was coming back to Rifthold to help her friends and not a moment too soon! This book - even though it was longer than book 3 - flew much faster with all the action and just PLOT between the pages."}

{"text": "I have been wanting to read Grendel for years and to re-familiarize myself with the Beowulf legend. \"Grendel,\" however, by John Garner, first published in 1971, turned out to be one of the strangest books I have every read. It is the Beowulf story told from the point of view of Grendel, a seeming invincible monster and probably one of the first serial killers in English literature.(The tone of this novel reminded me of Joyce Carol Oates' novel Zombie, about a teenage serial killer.) Before reading this novel, I read Seamus Heaney 2000 translation of \"Beowulf\" : an epic poem which was originally written in Angelo-Saxon between the 8th and 11th centuries. I found it to be mostly readable and beautifully written. In brief, Beowulf, a Scandinavia superhero (he can swim for six or seven days and in the process kills water monsters) goes to Demark to help the king whose \"mean hall,\" or feasting hall, has been terrorized for years by the monster Grendel, who has been killing his subjects by biting off their heads and eating them. Beowulf ultimately kills Grendel. Then he kills Grendel's mother who is out for her son's revenge, and then in old age Beowulf slays a dragon. This epic poem, an adventure story with loads of vivid action, is exciting to read. It pretty much focuses on Beowulf. Not too much is learned about Grendel. We learn, however, that he, his mother and other creatures were created by God after Cain killed Able. \n \"Grendel\" is told from the first-person point of view of the monster himself. He is an articulate creature. \"Talking, talking, spinning a spell, pale skin of words that closes me in like a coffin.\" How he learned to speak so well - and become so educated - is never explained. In fact, Grendel himself glosses over those points. He can even speak to the Danes that he is killing and terrorizing. Grendel lives with his mother in a cave. She does not have any language; she grunts and groans, but she is a mother who loves her son. Also, dwelling in the cave are shadows , the creatures created after Cane slew Able. The novel humanizes (dehumanizes?) Grendel, shows how he became a killer, a mass murderer. He does have a soft side. He falls for the queen, whom he cannot kill. The novel also paints a not-too-rosy picture of the Danes: they are greedy, immoral, duplicitous war-mongers. In a way, Grendel kills because of his treatment by the Danes (they treat him like a monster!) and also because that is what he is expected to do. The most awesome character in the book is the Dragon. He is erudite and philosophical. \"The laws of nature are large average effects which reign impersonally. But there is nothing average about expression: it is essentially individual.\" He lives in a cave and is surround by his pilfered gold, which is what he lives for. He says to Grendel, \"My advice to you, my violent friend, is to seek out gold and sit on it.\" He also tells Grendel that killing is Grendel's purpose in life : \"You improve them, (the Danes) my boy? Can't you see that yourself? You stimulate them! You make them think and scheme. You drive them to poetry, science, religion, all that makes them what they are for as long as they last. You are, so to speak, the brute existent by which they learn to define themselves.\" In the end, Grendel is killed by Beowulf, who is a shadowy figure in the novel and mentioned by name maybe only once. \n I recommend both \"Grendel\" and Seamus Heaney's translation of \"Beowulf.\" Both books are beautifully written, have depth, stay with you, but are not always easy to read. Yet they are well worth the patience and time spent on them."}

{"text": "More like 2.5 stars. Throne of Glass reminded me a bit of the Graceling trilogy, though the characters were far less lovable and the plot far more predictable than Graceling. I mean, the clues that you assume are red herrings are actually just pointing smack dab at the correct answer. After reading, I feel like I already know the jist of where the entire series is headed. \n As far as MCs go, Celaena is...meh. I didn't hate her, and I appreciate a female character who can kick butt and still enjoy dresses and frills. That being said, she felt more like a collection of traits and hobbies than a real person. Plus, she's a sneaky Mary Sue; sure she has a temper and is an occasional egomaniac, but these qualities just make everyone swooooon because they're so obviously fronts for all the emotional turmoil roiling beneath her (obnoxiously stunning) surface. In addition to being pretty enough for everyone to fall in love with (don't get me started on the dumb love triangle), she just, like, loves eating, and reading, and is a master piano player, and is also the greatest assassin in the entire world, literally. And she's eighteen. That should be enough, but I haven't even mentioned that Celaena is also super nice, super smart, a friend to conquered peoples, an orphan, and clearly has some latent magical ability. \n In spite of all this, she comes off as a terrible assassin; she consistently fails to pick up on obvious clues, cannot hit a stationary target with a flower pot, blabs left and right about what she's thinking and feeling, and is reduced to terror by the king. I did like Nehemia and Chaol, though, so there are certainly redeeming characters to balance out Celaena's extreme specialness. \n As with Maas's other series, ACOTAR, I though the strength of this book was in the world-building. Maas has given us a glimpse of a compelling landscape for the characters to explore and set of problems to resolve. I will definitely keep reading, if only to continue seeing more of Erilea and learning more about the role magic plays in its fabric. Even though I found much to criticize, I can't deny how much I enjoyed reading it and being immersed in a new fantasy world. Plus, I'm always a huge sucker for fairies. I'm hoping the rest of the series is stronger, and I'm definitely looking forward to the TV show that's apparently being optioned now!!!"}

{"text": "Where has this book been my whole life? I LOVED the Borribles, and to be honest with you I'm not sure why. \n I don't know if it's the adventure, the unique world, or strange characters that just... kept me reading, but I loved it. \n ******************************** \n It is time to jump in the way back machine and take a look at another 'oldie but goodie' book. This time I am featuring The Borribles, which is the first book in The Borrible Trilogy. The Borrible Trilogy is a gritty children's/YA urban fantasy series. \n I am surprised at the amount of people who have not heard about The Borribles. When I first read the book in 2012, I was over the moon about it. It was unlike anything I had read at the time and that was almost 36 years after it was first published. Immediately upon finishing it, I started talking about it to others and it was surprising the amount of people who answered with \"What are Borribles?\" or \"I have never even heard of this book\". \n To answer the question - a Borrible is a runaway child. They look just like regular children, but they have tiny pointed ears (which are easily covered by knitted hats). Once their ears are pointed, they stay a child forever unless their ears are clipped. Borribles are smart, witty, and capable of surviving in the world without the assistance of adults. Their biggest fear is being captured by adults and having their ears clipped, which will turn them into boring, dull individuals. \n Borribles form their own groups, which are like tiny little clans. These groups protect each other at all costs and even have their own claimed territory. \n The first novel, Borribles, starts off with the Borribles of Battersea encountering a giant rat-like creature. These rat-like creatures is typically only found in enemy territory, so the fact that it ventured into the Borribles of Battersea land is frightening and could be an indication that an invasion is near. In an effort to prevent an invasion, several brave Borribles volunteer to go on an epic journey. The Borribles tells the tale of this epic adventure. \n One of the first things that stands out about The Borribles is it is an extremely violent, gritty novel. I was surprised when I learned that many people classified it as a children's book. It definitely has a lot of violent, bloody scenes and the life the Borribles live is not all rainbows and butterflies. This book would probably be classified as a YA book by today's standards. \n What is there to like about The Borribles? It has a detailed, solid plot that moves at warp speed. It was amazing just how fast I was getting through the novel and before I knew it, it was over. The adventure scenes are detailed, but not to the point that they are over-fluffed up. Readers are given a sense of adventuring alongside The Borribles, but they aren't experiencing every, single mind-numbing part of the adventure. \n When the novel ends, there is a desire to pick up the second book right away. And I highly recommend doing that, as one novel completes and blends right into the second novel. It also helps to relieve some of the nagging questions some readers may have about the Borribles and their world. \n In addition to the detailed plot and fast paced action, the characters are surprisingly fleshed out. Considering the length of the book and the sheer number of characters (there are a lot more than 6 or 7), one would assume that the characters would be just one-dimensional individuals, but they really weren't. I honestly formed true bonds with the characters and by the end of the book, I have to admit there was a small part of me that wished I could become a Borrible. \n There is another aspect of The Borribles that I really enjoyed. It was the social commentary within the book. I read the novel as an adult, so I was able to appreciate the subtle hints and examples of social inequalities, pure greed, and other social problems. Many times authors try to beat the reader over the head with their point-of-view and opinions, but I didn't really get that with The Borribles. It was enough to make you think about things, but it didn't interfere with the plot or go overboard. \n Now, there is probably a concern that a book written in 1976 might not be relevant in today's world, especially an urban fantasy. The Borribles really fits in with today's world. Sure, some of the social commentary might be a bit dated, but for the most part, The Borribles is just as good when read today as it was back in 1976. This is probably because the world in the novel is unique. People will be able to relate it to London, but there are aspects that make it unique and fun to read. \n Overall, I was surprised at just how much I enjoyed The Borribles. It wouldn't have been a book I would have thought I'd have enjoyed as much as I did. I wish more people knew about it and gave it a try, but I really think in terms of urban fantasy it is a classic. So hope in your time machine and give it a try, you won't regret it!"}
{"text": "Rachel Caine's book Ink and Bone was another huge favorite of mine. It was a novel that had a very Harry Potter-ish feel to it, but it still had a unique feel. Everything from the concept and loveable character, to the world building was captivating. I was so in love with the book that I honestly could not wait for the second book, Paper and Fire to come out. \n Considering how high my expectations were, the immediate question you should ask yourself is \"Does Paper and Fire live up to the hype and expectations placed on it from the first book?\". My answer would be \"Sort of\". \n Paper and Fire is the ultimate definition of a middle book. The first novel, Ink and Bone, was so unique and surprising that it was a pure delight to read. It made readers want to love it. Paper and Fire, while a wonderful novel, doesn't have that sparkle and shine that comes with a first book in a series. \n The biggest issue with Paper and Fire is its plot progression and speed. There is a lot of action going on during Paper and Fire. The characters are arranging rescue missions, running from enemies, and trying to stay ahead of The Library. Unfortunately, there is this feel of too much action. \n The characters are always running around doing something or exploring a new place or looking for some clue. While this might seem like plot progression, there is very stagnant feel to the book. It is almost like all the characters did was run around and not a whole lot was accomplished. In fact, I ended the book and my first thought was 'We didn't really get much done'. \n The entire second book is basically one giant rescue mission. There are some tidbits here and there that further a character's development or progress the plot a little, but not enough. It really had a feel of a lot of running around and not a lot of progression. \n I will say the last few chapters opened up a whole new possibility for the next book and a lot happened in the end, but there were still a lot of missed opportunities throughout the book. Let's just say that there is a cliffhanger at the end and it will definitely leave fans of the series waiting in anticipation for book three. \n Even though it was a rushed book and basically one giant rescue mission, it doesn't mean the book was bad. It just didn't have the appeal the first book did. There are still a lot of things I loved about the book - the idea of who controls what when it comes to knowledge and books, the whole portrayal that reading physical books is better than a screen on a tablet, and the whole idea that using technology to store information could result in some very important information being wiped away if the higher ups don't agree with it. \n Overall, Paper and Fire was a fun read. It didn't have the wowing power the first book did in the series, but it wasn't bad. There is a lot to look forward to with this series and I honestly cannot wait until book three."}

{"text": "An utterly delightful and moving fantasy that is sure to enchant middle school readers! \n In a sad little town called the Protectorate, there exists a terrible tradition- every year on a certain day the youngest member of the community must be left deep in the nearby woods as a sacrifice to the evil witch who lives there. The villagers mourn their lost babies, but if this task is not fulfilled the entire town will pay the price. \n At the same time every year, a kind old witch wanders through the forest and finds a poor abandoned baby that has inexplicably been left to fend for itself in the woods. With no other option, she takes the babies to the town at the far end of the forest, feeding them starlight and keeping them safe on the long journey where they will finally be welcomed with yearning hearts and open arms. \n This year is different. A mother refuses to give up her daughter, and is driven mad when the baby is taken regardless. A young man accompanies the elders on their mission and begins to question the morality of their actions. The witch who finds the child accidently feeds her moonlight instead of starlight, and realizes that since the baby is now full of magic, she must keep her and teach her how to control her powers. This year the winds of change have begun to stir, and when baby Luna turns thirteen and realizes what she is capable of, the storm will awaken in full force and nothing will be the same. \n This wonderful fantasy is not to be missed. With lyrical writing, delightful characters, and lovely messages, Barnhill has truly created magic. \n This ARC was obtained at BEA16, in exchange for an honest review."}

She wields a broader vocabulary than any writer I can name and can write sentences that flow clear and fast. They sparkle with wit and insight. The subject matter, retold fairy tales with an erotic twist, feels a bit aged, like the darkly lit, wood paneled men's club interiors of chaste Sixties Playboy photoshoots, and there are quite a few wolves, which imagery feels overused. The libido-on-the-loose vibe pervades these stories, but the feminist messaging, if any, went right over my head."}

{"text": "Some books have that unique ability to capture your attention instantly. Every Heart A Doorway by Seanan McGuire was one of those book. I was barely three pages into the book and I was already immersed in the world and forming an emotional bond with our first main character - Nancy. \n Every Heart A Doorway tells the captivating tale about a boarding school for young adults between the ages of 12 and 18, but unlike regular boarding schools this one is designed as a rehabilitation center of sorts. All of the young adults who are present at the school have at one point in time journeyed to alternate fantasy worlds. These worlds include everything from lands with fairies and unicorns and rainbows or Wonderland weird worlds, to just plain scary/horror universes or the land of the dead. \n All of the children at the school are struggling with one major problem - they want to go back to their fantasy world, but they have been cast out from it and it might not happen. This has caused all the children to experience what can only be described as PTSD-like symptoms. Of course, the children also have to deal with other \"real life\" issues, such as forming relationships, dealing with parents, navigating the scary world of high school, and overcoming bullying. \n Nancy, our main character of the story, is a new student at the boarding school. Unfortunately, right as she arrives at the school murders start happening. Every Heart A Doorway follows Nancy and her new friends as they work to find themselves, solve a mystery, and work to potentially find their hidden doorway that will lead them back to their fantasy world. \n Every Heart A Doorway may seem - from its description - to be a light, fluffy fantasy novel, but it emotional and dark. Many of the characters are struggling with extreme emotional issues and various problems, which leads to a disturbing/creepy feel to the novel. \n One of the amazing things about Every Heart A Doorway was how detailed almost all the characters were. This is only a 170 page novella, but every character from Nancy to the secondary characters of Jack and Jill, was fleshed out and felt real. A pretty amazing feat when you consider the novel also had to create a world/backstory and progress the current plot all in 170 pages. \n Characters weren't the only extremely well-thought out or creative element. I was intrigued with the whole hidden door/alternative universe concept, which was extremely detailed and fascinating to me. I probably could have read an entire 400 page novel on just this concept alone, but it was extremely well-done given the short page count. \n While I did enjoy the novel, I have to admit the murder mystery part of it fell flat for me. The mystery element comes in about a quarter of the way through the novel and it never really felt well developed. It had a very rushed feel to it, especially when things were solved and everything was 'wrapped up'. \n Despite the clunky or rushed feeling at the end of the novel, I was impressed with Every Heart a Doorway. It certainly isn't your light, fluffy Narnia/Wonderland novel, even though it seems like it might be from the overview. It is a novel that is emotionally engaging, unique, and creepy/weird. \n While it may not be my top read for the year, it certainly is up there. I would recommend Every Heart a Doorway to fantasy lovers who are looking for something unique or for those that have ever wondered how characters reacted when they left their fantasy world and returned to their real lives."}

{"text": "The Secret Crusade is the second book I read from the Assassin's Creed book series, and surely enough, it is astoundingly out of this world. The narrator is Niccolo Polo, who tells the incredible story of the Assassin Altair, and the events that happen through his life and consequently shape his creed. Altair had a mission to undertake, killing nine men that was. Soon he was to discover the connection between them. Furthermore, he started finishing them, one at a time, and uncertainty grew inside of him each time he did so, and all the way looking for answers soon to reveal before him and leave him in surprise of the turning of events. \n The story is profound and very well-written. For the second time, I sense the extraordinary form of emerging emotions and feelings throughout the novel. I know how good a book is from the impact it leaves on me and how much it makes me pensive.. That was deeply felt after reading Oliver Bowden's work. Sheer magnificence indeed. \n Ultimately, I feel pleased to have this novel on my shelf!"}
{"text": "This audiobook was read by the same guy who read Under the Banner of Heaven. Although I'd heard him read before, it took me a while to get in tune with his doing multiple characters. Once I got into it, though, I think he did a really nice job. His monotone fit the story of androids, bounty-hunters, and electric animals. In a post World War III Earth, most inhabitants have emigrated to Mars, androids escape from the red planet and run around back on Earth, and because of the radioactive dust, men wear dust-proof cod pieces and animals are ridiculously rare and coveted. It's quite different from Bladerunner (though now that I've finished the book, I want to re-watch the movie), but good in its own way."}

Somehow Cat was able to do that, and I cared about what happened to every character. I also couldn't handle the suspense and the twists. I really enjoyed it. Can't wait for the next one!!"}
{"text": "The tiny English village of Milbury lies at the center of an enormous ring of standing stones, but that is not its only oddness, as Adam and his young son Matthew quickly learn. Adam has come to the village for a few months to take scientific readings of the stones, and he and Matthew are immediately struck by the strange behaviour of nearly all of Milbury's residents. From their universal greeting of \"Happy Day!\" to the apparent brilliance of Matthew's classmates, everything feels wrong. The only exceptions are a few other newcomers to the village, an eccentric Welsh poacher named Dai, and Mr. Hendrick, who lives in the old manor house. Gradually, Adam and Matthew realise that the villagers are subject to some sinister power which saps their wills and removes all thought and independence, and their fellow newcomers are falling prey to it before their eyes. How can they fight the danger when they don't know what it is, or how it will come at them? All they know is that they must do something quickly, before they are the only ones left in Milbury with the power of independent thought. All they know is that it's something to do with the stones. A good read, especially for the 9-12 set. The only issue I have with it is a low level of casual misogyny. This book was published in the 1970's, and it seems like, even though Margaret and her daughter Sandra have been in Milbury longer, Adam and Matthew come up with all the good ideas to solve the mystery, while \"the girls\" [sic:] just sit around going, \"I never thought of that!\""}
{"text": "One of the best Vamp Books I've ever read \n This book was freaking awesome! If you are a PNR fan, add this IMMEDIATELY to your tbr or buy it right now! Jessica blew my mind with this one; never ever would I've guessed it'd be THIS awesome. \n You know what was the best part in this book huh?? I'll tell you: No effing, unnecessary, cheesy romance that makes your head hurt, cringe, or role your eyes! It's true, sometimes a book is much better without all the drama and lovey-dovey crap. Instead, Jessica focused to keep her story thrilling, exciting, by adding twists & turns, and some seriously mind-f@ckery. She kept on surprising me until the very last percentages and I often heard myself saying:Oh no...no, she didn't/wouldn't do that to the character...oh crap, she really did. Yeah,Jessica had not really any mercy for her characters *chuckles*, and I LOVED it -every piece of it. \n \"This is not a story about love. There is no happy ending. There is only darkness, and the struggle to avoid being consumed by it. This is a story about survival.\" \n She made Mia fall out of a building, smash her head in, getting almost sucked dry, and some rough sex on the kitchen counter was there too- I was truly in PNR heaven :D \n Ok, here a bit about the story. \n Never ever had Mia thought she'd end up as one of those girls... those girls, you know, that got kidnapped, never seen or heard of again. Well, her cockiness put her exactly in this situation. She gets abducted and that's were her living hell begins. \n \"They're going to rape me and kill me and I am going to die. They're going to bury me in the woods ...\" \n She finds herself in a rotten room with a 'roommate',who's half dead, waiting to get put out of her misery like an old dog. This so-called roomy tells her that every 90days she usually has a new roommate...well crap huh, Mia thinks. BUT little did she know that the big bad Vamp boss has different plans with her. \n \" 'How long will you keep me?\"I asked suddenly. he didn't have to think about it. 'Forver.' I believed him.\" \n When Mia gets moved to another room, one of his Vamps,Ryan, she uses the only chance to escape... a chance that ended in a free fall, face first. \n I still don't know if I love or hate Ryan. He's a special kind of twisted. His action didn't all really make sense to me, but I think that's what truly hooked me. I love weird characters, trying to figure them and their attentions out. It's still unclear what is really going on in this VERY old Vamps mind. He's a closed book, but he's the one who changed Mia's life forever. One minute he's sugar sweet and I wanna hug and squeeze him: \n \"You made me want to be a better person, he said in my head, ... You're the reason i'm leaving that life behind. I want to help you...\" \n oh and in the next minute I wanna flog him myself. He's unpredictable, a ticking time-bomb, and I loved the crap out of him. I'm dying to know what he truly thinks and feels for Mia. \n Is he using her just as a tool for himself, having his own agenda or are his intentions pure and honest?? I do not know yet, but I'm eager to find that out in book 2 ! \n \"I'll never leave you ... I'll never be afraid of you. *sigh, he really does know when to push the right button. \n But Mia doesn't forget, he's the reason why she's here in the first place... why she died with 17. \n It's a constant struggle and this book has some disturbing things going on, so be aware!!If you don't want to feel offended, then take a minute and put yourself in Mia's shoes - I know what she wants and did was cruel, but ask yourself: What have you done? \n Nevertheless, I can't wait to get my hands on book 2! \n If you're looking for a HEA, then don't pick this book up; if you're looking for a cheesy romance, then don't either; but if you're looking for a kick-ass Vamp book that makes you gasp, wonder, yell out loud and glues you to your kindle because you wanted to find out what's going on, then this is a must read! \n This is NOT your typically come of age, NA/YA Vamp book -and thank f@ck for that!! \n Copy of book given by author in exchange for an honest review \n _____________________________________ \n Amazon buy link: http://amzn.to/1oDv73u \n My Blog review: http://bit.ly/1l66O7t"}

One day, he finds a hurt girl on the street, and despite his girlfriend's protest he decides to take her home and take care of her. What he doesn't know is that there is a parallel London where magic and legends are real, and that saving Gate's life means he gave up his confortable world for this magical but deadly one. With the help of the Marquis de Carabas and a bodyguard called Hunter, he must help Gate discover who killed her family and wants to kidnap her before the cruel assassins Croup and Vandemar can catch them. \n This was just an ok book for me. I was definitively expecting more. I couldn't connect with the characters, and I didn't understand the world at all. Maybe is because I'm not from London, so the inside jokes didn't really humor me. It seems the author just took names of places literally and that made the whole parallel world, but there was no cohesion. It was just random places. \n I also felt too much like it was a tv series (I understand it was originaly that). For example, he revealed things to the reader but not to the characters, so you hae to wait almost the whole book for them to catch up. That for me is unforgivable. There is no big surprise, and the ending was not satisfactory. It felt flat. That made it hard to finish until almost the end.

{"text": "I received a free copy for an honest review and this is my stop in Aoife Sheridan's October blog tour! \n \"Ghosts, angels, and demons exist. They are not the things from movies. They are so much worse.\" (p. 43) \n Hunters is the first instalment in The Demon Series by Aoife Marie Sheridan. \n I enjoyed the novel, loved the characters but the protagonist, Abigail, I hated her! \n It's the first time for me to dislike a central character so much. \n Abigail Thornton is a nineteen-year-old vodka-aholic demon hunter. But instead of demon hunting, it seems she has a knack for attracting demons - for reasons unknown to her or the reader. \n In the first demon-hunting encounter the reader comes across, the demon recognises Abigail and calls her by her name. The situation is unheard-of, even for a hunter. \n I particularly like how every character is a mystery, not just the central character or Daniel, who is always by her side and is like every girl's dream, but also Cathy, Nicholas, Father Peter, even Simon, to a small extent. \n Abigail has had a rough childhood. Her mother, as she remembers her, suffered from depression and was rarely herself. Her father was never around and her childhood was spent playing with her brother Sam. Abigail came across her mother's body after she had committed suicide. But that wasn't the worst thing eleven-year-old Abigail saw that night, there was someone else in the bathroom, a dark figure, whose face she had never seen before. \n Abigail and I can agree that some characters are just down-right obnoxious like Steven and Cathy, though the latter can be good at times. \n There is a thin line of romance in the novel, between the often unfeeling Abigail and Daniel. The love is not unrequited, it's a mystery of its own. However, one often gets the urge to want to smack Abigail on the face, like when Cathy does, but for different reasons. \n Sheridan lays out several mysterious threads throughout the novel, a sort of large setting for the parts to come. Some threads are answered, others are not. As the saying goes \"The more you know, the less you know.\" (No idea who said it), but that's the situation with Abigail. She has so many questions about herself, her parents, her life, Daniel. But as she begins to ask questions, she begins to fear the answers that she will hear. Worse, answers come to questions she never even thought of; they begin to surface, particularly those of her birth. \n Hunters is narrated in the first person perspective, mostly from Abigail's point of view, though occasionally from Daniel's. Abigail might be a sad and angry teen most of the time, but she is highly sarcastic, giving some dark humour to the already dark story. \n I look forward to reading the coming instalments in the series and to see how these threads of mystery will come to light. I hope more questions will be answered rather than asked."}

{"text": "Magic, Merlin and lots of humour and mayhem, that's the first thing that came to mind when I started reading Sharon Pape's Magic & Mayhem. \n A paranormal, fast-paced, hilarious cozy mystery, Magic & Mayhem opens with Kailyn Wilde adjusting to the passing of her mother and grandmother, both witches, and to becoming the only person in charge of their magick shop \"Abracadabra\". \n Narrated from Kailyn's first person perspective, the novel is full of humourous comments, descriptions and events. Set in the small town of New Camel, the mystery is revealed from the beginning when Kailyn and her aunt Tilly go to see their lawyer and find him dead. \n \"In this town, heavy traffic was five cars lined up at a red light.\" \n Magic & Mayhem has an assortment of wonderful - and less friendly - characters, but all of whom have a role to play. There is Kailyn, whose magic, along with that of her family, has suffered a bug of late, as well as her aunt Tilly, who reads palms - although the accuracy of her readings can be questionable. \n Kailyn follows her mother's advice and attempts to summon a familiar, a kind of animal guide believed to help witches with their magic. Instead, she discovers an old man in her basement who goes by the name of Merlin. To her and Tilly's surprise - and to the reader's - the great wizard himself was somehow thrust forward in time from the Middle Ages to Kailyn's storeroom. \n \"Did this man really expect me to believe he was the legendary wizard? He looked more like a Don Quixote wannabe.\" \n One of the funniest and most entertaining aspects about Magic & Mayhem is Merlin's adjustment to and discovery of the gadgets of the modern world, from the toilet to the iPod to pizza. \n I loved the references to books and movies, as well as all the magic and witch-related terminology which gave Magic & Mayhem a truly magical feel. It made me feel I was part of the story. The overall word choice of the novel was perfect and the narration was highly enjoyable. The imagery was interesting and impeccable throughout. I have never seen so many perfectly-worded similes in one place. \n \"The kettle had gone from whistling to screeching like a banshee, by the time I plucked it off the stove. Merlin stood in the middle of the kitchen, rotating like a clumsy ballerina.\" \n After the discovery of the dead body, Kailyn begins her own investigation and several townspeople attempt to help her in any way they can, whether through throwing gossip her way or through actual help. Kailyn's curiosity is commendable, especially after she begins receiving death threats, and with the fact that the best suspect for the murder is her best friend Elise. \n \"There was no telling what would happen to history if Merlin died in the twenty-first century. It was bad enough that he would return to his time babbling about computers, aircraft, and men on the moon.\" \n As a cozy mystery, Magic & Mayhem fits all the characteristics, having a fair share of quirky characters, cats and a well-penned mystery. I liked how romance did not play a major - or even minor - role in the novel. \n Characterisation and setting were among the aspects that drew me in to the novel as well. Each character was well defined and the setting was realistic. Coupled with the fast pace of the novel, I couldn't put the book down. \n Almost before I was half way through the novel did I expect to give it a five-star rating. Having finished, I'd definitely give it 10 stars and can't wait to get my hands on the second instalment in the Abracadabra Mystery Series by Sharon Pape. A must-read at all costs. \n \"If we ever figured out how to send him home, it might to be with a pizza oven.\" \n Note: I received a free copy of Magick & Mayhem by Sharon Pape in exchange for an honest review as part of a blog tour with Lori Great Escapes Virtual Book Tours."}
{"text": "The Treemakers started as a dark and beautifully written story, but soon turned unnecessarily inappropriate for a book classified as being for young adults. I enjoyed the variety of genres it explored; with hints of romance, adventure and mystery that kept me guessing more often than I thought it would. I was disappointed with the direction that it took. The first third and last third of the story had so much potential and originality. I have to admit to being conflicted between finding some of the writing too dark for young adults, and some of the writing too childish."}

{"text": "Despite the good writing, I couldn't finish this one. The first story was fine, the second one was sort of okay, but by the third I was so tired of sparkling perfect beautiful supernatural creatures that I just couldn't stand to read anymore. And the protagonist in the third story, Keller, was so rude and obnoxious that I couldn't even stand to see things from her point of view."}

{"text": "So, am I the only person who didn't realize that this book is meant to be the first in a trilogy? I guess I'm kind of glad I was unaware, because I probably would have given it a pass if I had known. Finding out that there is more to come definitely made me feel better about the less than satisfying ending, though. Saved me from having to hunt down Mr. Cronin and shaking him real hard while yelling \"How could you do this to me!\" over and over again, so yay for trilogies on all fronts! \n As for the novel itself, there were times, especially in the middle, when things dragged a bit. It also took me a bit to get used to the epic nature- not the length, but the breadth of the story. Just when I became attached to a characters, or a particular feel of the book, Cronin would rip the rug out from under me and I would have to adjust my frame of mind. \n Although I'm not sure that the story had to be quite as long as it was, I am glad I read it, I was thorougly entertained, and I am looking forward to the next volume."}

{"text": "This really does deserve the whole five stars, but I just couldn't do it. Part of me wanted a Neil Gaiman story from beginning to end. Norse Mythology is simply what it claims to be, a telling of the Norse tales as best as can be done. It is more than enough. I was sucked in from page one and it is with much sadness that I close the finished book only a day later. Quite often while I was reading it I could hear Mr. Gaiman's clear, Brittish voice reading aloud. There aren't many authors that I want to read their work almost as much as I want them to write it. It is because I have come to associate Gaiman and his voice as being on a different plain, of escaping reality and connecting with the magic that he writes. \n Norse mythology is often thought as simply a parallel to Roman with different characters. Mr. Gaiman's book has provided some of the stories, and a background which is adds to every Norse reference that I encounter. Sure I knew Loki, Odin and Thor, and of Valhalla and Asgard. Now I know how Thor got his hammer and of Loki's daughter Hel guards the Underworld. I know how Ragnarok ends the world, only to have it begin again."}

After that, I would find myself trying to keep on task doing something else but wandering back to Siren to read more. \n Our main character, Vanessa, gets involved in a mystery of sorts, which keeps you guessing as the reader for the entire thing. As you may have guessed, the title does play a role, but since it has elements of fantasy you aren't able to immediately figure out what is happening with Vanessa and her sister. \n It's a hefty book (almost 350 pages), but I whipped through it and really enjoyed myself (besides the time I was reading it alone at night and my phone rang, making me jump). The one thing I did NOT like, and actually really really did not like, were bits in the end - some of it felt rushed and I was not satisfied with how it was tied up in the end. I'm wondering if they are hoping for a sequel? \n This is a very strong read, especially for those that enjoy paranormal books."}
{"text": "Sarasija Mishra has no idea what he's gotten himself into when he blindly accepts a job offer that moves him from Washington to New Orleans. He's never met the man he'll be an assistant to, but the pay is substantial and the contract is for a single year. He wants to help pay some of his mother's bills now that his father recently passed--and he feels a bit inadequate compared with his elder siblings who all went to professional schools, while he screwed around and got a \"go nowhere\" degree. \n Sara's not so pleased when it turns out his employer lives in a rundown bayou house in the midst of the swamp. And his employer, Mr. Thaddeus Dupont doesn't want him there. All Sara can think is it's because Mr. Dupont doesn't want a gay man living with him, but he soon realizes that Mr. Dupont is a man unlike any he's met before. \n I mean, really, has anyone ever heard of a gay vampire monk? \n This book seems like it would be lighthearted, or at least kooky-spooky, but it's really an awesome paranormal thriller/romance. Thad has devoted his last 85 years to being an agent of death for demons the Catholic church can't eradicate. He works within a shadowy organization, the White Monks, who kill demons, and he's their back-up plan when it gets ugly. Thad does this, and maintains his celibacy, in order to redeem his soul. A devout Catholic, Thad wants the chance at an Afterlife, but being so close to Sara is an excruciating temptation. Sara is meant to be his food source. Thad can survive on small droughts of blood, but he only wants female vessels because they don't arouse him. Plus, Thad's compulsion powers don't seem to work very well on Sara. Sara's invading Thad's mind, too, which is deeply unsettling. \n Thad hasn't seen so much demon activity...ever, and the called ones are particularly interested in Thad. Why? Who's calling them, and how does this guy know so much about Thad's ancient history? The demons strike close to Thad's core, kidnapping his daytime agent, Nohea, and attacking Sara. Meanwhile, the ghost of Thad's only lover, Leo, has come a-calling and the message is not good: the person controlling the demon activity wants Thad to turn him into a vampire. \n The interplay between Sara and Thad is really a yummy build up of emotional and sexual tension. Sara isn't best-pleased to learn he signed up to be a year-long feast for Thad, yet he's paradoxically miffed when Thad won't drink from him. Is it because he's a dude? Is it the gay thing? Because Sara finds Thad to be very attractive, and his esteem grows by leaps and bound when he sees Thad in action, fighting and destroying the demons. Soon, he feels honored, not obliged, to offer himself for Thad's use--and that doesn't just mean as a blood snack. Thad's inner reserve is great, but he cannot resist beautiful, sultry Sara for too long. He also can't help feeling guilty afterward. \n I loved the intertwining of religion here, because Sara is a nominal Hindu. He didn't really practice the religion, but he knows some of the ancient tales, and begins a little bit of practice as a center for his own concept of soul--following Thad's example. It was cool how this came to be important at the climax, and I really enjoyed the inter-racial and interfaith aspects of the book. \n It's a little different take on the vampire mythos, but a nice change for the paranormal fan. There's more action than romance, but the tension is great, the plot quickly-paced and the hope that Thad and Sara can make something beautiful come from their odd-couple connection is also high. There are also elements of humor that are totally fun. Sara's a dead-pan kinda guy, and Thad hasn't had so much leavity in his life in a long, long time. I really loved how determined Thad was to keep human fatalities to a minimum, and how reverent he felt about Sara. He's a good man who got caught in a bad way. What was also sweet was the position the White Monks took to the advent of Sara, and Thad breaking his celibacy vow. The story ends, but the series has just begun. Very excited to follow along! \n I received a review copy of this book via NetGalley."}

{"text": "Grishas have powers like healing and controlling tides and fire, but their home Ravka has lost most of the war against Fjerda, a country that kills them for having these powers. They consider them unnatural and dangerous, and some of them burn them in a pyre. Now it seems there is a drug that a scientist has developed that can amplify their powers immensely but is also so addictive that most people that try it die while trying to get more. \n In a small island called Kerch, Kaz is the second in command of a gang. He's considered a demon, feared by most and a target of the other gangs. But when a man offers him 30 million to rescue the scientist that has the formula for the drug, he decides the risk is worth it, so he can get the money to finally have his revenge on his brother's murderer. He designs a plan to infiltrate Fjerda, and gathers a team: Inej, a young girl that he saved from a pleasure mansion in exchange for her working as her spy and assassin. Jesper, a shooter that has a serious gambling problem. Wylan, a young boy that can make bombs and whose also the son of the man that hired them. Nina, a Grisha that can heal people but also kill them. And Matthias, a Fjerdan that has a history with Nina. \n I loved this book!! Its slow paced at times, but its interesting and you just want to keep reading. I LOVED the characters, especially Inej and Kaz. I know the book is a bit predictable, but the characters are just too endearing and the plot grabs you. \n Inej is amazing. She's strong and smart, quiet and loyal. She has such a hard past. She is so grateful to Kaz for saving her, and treating her like she's free and not owned, and eventually, realizes she's in love with him against her better judgment. Being a slave and sold as a prostitute was so hard, that it breaks my heart. While the book doesn't give you any horrible details, you can tell how much she suffered by the way she panics just looking at anything related to that place. I also love that she refuses Kaz, knowing that his phobia is so strong that they won't be able to have a real relationship. \n I also love Kaz. He's so broken he's made this whole persona whose only purpose is revenge. His phobia is the only remanent of weakness and it's his body's way of dealing with his pain. He doesn't allow himself to grieve or feel anything but hatred, and while it drives him, it's also hurting him. It seems that Inej is the only thing that makes him feel something else, and in a way her being taken drives him even more than his need for revenge for the death of his brother. \n Jesper was so much fun. He brings some deserved comedy to the book, but he's also faulted and broken in a way. His need for adrenaline and his gambling can make him do stupid things, but in a way that makes the character great. I thought he had a crush on Inej at first, but then realized it was on Kaz. It seems he's falling for Wylan, and while sometimes a relationship like that can be a little forced, it felt natural and exciting to see develop. I wasn't expecting him to be the one that sold them out, but he didn't mean to compromise the mission. He can be naive and blind because of his fear for his father's farm, but he can't stop himself at the gambling tables. I hope he grows as a character. \n I loved Nina and Matthias. Nina is so strong and smart, and Matthias is the type that has a really strong sense of moral and duty to his country and religion, so strong that he's blind to the radical ways of his people and has a hard time opening his eyes to the lies. It is only with Nina that he starts to doubt his beliefs. Matthias reminded me of Wakka from Final Fantasy X, he's the typical fervent believer that thinks his war and murders are justified. When he feels attracted to Nina and starts to see her as a human, bold and brave and compassionate, he's conflicted with himself. I love how Nina is totally in love with him, but at the same time is strong in her beliefs and won't put her country in danger at any cost. \n I wasn't expecting Wylam's father to be the bad guy, but I also wasn't expecting Kaz to use Wylan as Kuwei. \n I can't wait to read the next book. I hope we get to see Ravka, meet more Grishas and expand the world even more. It's such an interesting universe that I want to explore the whole map. And I really hope they get the recenge they deserve."}

{"text": "Note: I received a free copy of Lady Blackwing from its author Devorah Fox in exchange for an honest review. \n \"What would she write for her first entry?\" \n A character study of poor ole Ollie over there? Or, how about that Laundry Room Zombie Apocalypse? Mercedes twirled the pencil, the scene forming in her mind's eye. \n Lady Blackwing by Devorah Fox is a 25-page novella about Mercedes, a waitress who likes to write but never finishes a story. \n The short novella opens with Roger, a man who wants to write his big story and so buys an extravagant notebook, a brand of pencil known to have been used by John Steinbeck. He sits at a cafe and orders an espresso, \"The drink of famous writers who, if they didn't hang out in bars as had Hemingway, hung out in coffeehouses.\" \n Roger gets frustrated by his inability to write a single word and leaves his notebook and pencil on the cafe table and leaves. Although Roger's accumulation of items used by his favourite authors doesn't do anything for him, they do more than plenty for someone else. \n The opening character reminded me of myself, when I want to create the perfect setting to get my writing flowing but nothing actually happens. Writers will easily relate and sympathise to him. \n \"He failed to understand what was so special about these notebooks and why Hemingway and other writers were so fond of them. His hadn't done a thing for him. His Muse had been AWOL.\" \n After Mercedes writers her first story, she wakes up to discover that it might have been real. As Lady Blackwing progresses, Mercedes slowly begins to write, grow confident and understand what the magical pencil can do. \n While there is little imagery in the story, there is character development for Mercedes. The book cover isn't the prettiest but it shouldn't put you off. \n I liked how Devorah Fox makes the reader question the paranormal aspect of the novella. I also liked the idea of a story within a story. As we get bits and pieces from Mercedes' short stories. The reader also gets to see how Mercedes, as an author, thinks; how she tries to throw obstacles in her protagonist's way and tries to resolve. \n Overall, Lady Blackwing by Devorah Fox is an exciting, quick-paced short novella. Highly recommended. \n Author Devorah Fox has revealed that she is currently writing a sequel to Lady Blackwing. I'm curious what else awaits Mercedes in the new adventure. \n Overall rating: 4.5 stars"}
{"text": "I have never really liked angel/demon themed books, and I have read quite a few of them with the hope that \"this one\" will change my mind. I really didn't have high expectations for Sweet Evil when I started reading, but soon found myself unable to put it down. I read this book in one sitting because it is by far one of the most engrossing paranormal/fantasy YA books I have read in some time. \n The characters were just plain awesome. The were well written and believable. Each and every one was written well-developed and interesting in their own right. There is nothing I hate more than a female protagonist that is annoying, who makes irrational snap decisions, or who relies on others' heroism. Anna is none of these things. Others have commented on how \"good\" she is, how it is unbelievable that she doesn't lie, respects Patti, ect. considering she is a teenager. I disagree with that. That is who Anna is, due to her mother's influence, and its intrinsic to the person she's become. I feel it makes her even more believable and adds to the inner struggle for the character which makes the plot that much more interesting. My first impression of Kaiden was, \"great another bad boy about to be reformed by love.\" Boy was I wrong. I loved the fact that he didn't lose himself in the feelings he developed for Anna, and how didn't turn into some simpering love-sick puppy. He retained that \"I'm a jerk, so what?\" attitude, but you could tell that he was engaging in some inner change/growth. The rest of the supporting characters complimented the story well without detracting my attention from the main plot. \n The book was not what I would call action-packed, but that's not a bad thing. The pacing was slow, but the author was world building and developing character relationships, within the book as well as with the reader. If you are one of those readers that need non-stop action cover to cover, then this might not be the book for you. I image now that the author has set the stage, future books will much more fast paced. \n I'm glad I took a chance with this one. The theme is not unique, but the author's spin on it is. The plot captured my attention and held it the entire book. I thought the characters were well written and had a certain relate-ability that was refreshing. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the genre, I believe you won't be disappointed!"}

There are certain aspects of this that I absolutely LOVED -- as in had me jumping up from my bed in excitement type of love -- but it wasn't enough to push it up there with my favorites. \n What I LOVED: \n The plot twists! Boy, does this book have it's plot twists! I can honestly say I did not expect the majority of those, and I enjoyed being mindblown during those instances. \n The characters were great, for the most part -- not likable per se (some not at all), but they were intriguing to read about. The villain was especially twisted and sick, I thought, and I loved to hate her. \n The writing was great. Even when I was frustrated that the story was going nowhere, I still enjoyed the reading experience (if that makes sense?). Melinda does a fantastic job with ambiance, and I thoroughly enjoyed her writing in that sense. \n What I...didn't...love: \n I mentioned it previously, but I found myself a bit frustrated with the first half of the book. I feel like not much happened in the first half. High fantasy novels obviously need to set up a whole new world, but compared to everything that happened in the second half, I don't know if there was enough of a setup in the beginning for all of the twists and turns at the end. This leads me to my next point: \n It feels like this was trying to tackle and include too many elements in such a relatively short novel. \n The fact that she's supposed to have these powers, but no, wait, she doesn't. So there's no magic in this world? No wait, yes there is! Remember that medallion mentioned really briefly 150 pages ago? Yeah, that's super important now! That fairy tale you thought was merely symbolic and random, turns out it's very literal! And the guy she (and I as a reader) fell in love with is really a total d**k, but you only find that out in the last 10pages! Ugh! \n I really, really wish that this was a longer novel. There were just too many things going on and I wish some of them were better developed. \n ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n That being said, I think I will read the next book. I was invested enough in the story (and some of those twists) to want to know how the story continues -- especially with this new discovered threat, and I really want to see Twylla develop further. I wanted her to be a lot more badass than she was. \n I'm definitely keeping my fingers crossed for the next one!"}

{"text": "On paper - or the flap of a book cover - Doon sounds like an amazing and slightly unique book that was just perfect for me. It promised to be 'loosely based' off of musical Brigadoon and it takes place in Scotland. Unfortunately, what was promised didn't really meet up to what was delivered. \n The entire idea behind the story was fairly original and had so much potential, but extremely predictable, almost boring main characters, a slow moving plot, and irritating conversations and 'cutesy catch phrases' really just ruined the whole book. \n I'll start with the main characters. The novel switches between the POV of Veronica and Mackenna. These characters were extremely irritating to the point it ruined the whole book. \n Veronica is this 'gorgeous' beauty who doesn't know how beautiful she is, but that isn't the worst. She spends the entire novel swooning over this mysterious guy and whining/crying about how broken she is as a person all because her daddy left her and her boyfriend dumped her. While I understand the need for this back story, we - as readers - are reminded of Veronica's daddy issues and boyfriend woes every 5 seconds. \n Mackenna is the opposite of Veronica, except she too doesn't realize she's beautiful. She is supposed to be fun-loving, but comes across as snarky, mean, and extremely jaded. Now, here is the kicker. She loves Broadway and musicals. So, every few moments she is comparing life to some favorite musical or saying these really cheesy phrases like 'Holy Hammerstein!' and ' Sweet Baby Sondheim'. \n Maybe things have changed since I was a teen, but I can almost guarantee that teenage girls would not repeatedly make these phrases an everyday occurrence, multiple times throughout the day. It just seemed unrealistic and very tiring. \n If the bad characterization of the two main characters wasn't bad enough, we are given the secondary character of James MacCrae and Duncan MacCrae. These are extremely handsome guys who come equipped with eight-pack abs, because six-pack abs just aren't sexy/hot enough. Unfortunately, these characters lack personality and are only developed from afar because we are given a look into life from Veronica/Mackenna. \n Another huge issue with the book was the writing. The team of authors seemed set out to make a point that Veronica/Mackenna are BFFs. To make their point, they tell the readers that these two 'share a brain' at least a dozen times. I get that it is a cute phrase and all, but it really was overused. \n In addition to the issue of the overuse of cute phrases, the use of a rather frustrating Scottish dialect made this novel a difficult read. Every individual who is from Scotland speaks with an abundance of dinnas, kennas, tas, fers, and other random words. Every single time someone opened their mouth they had this come out of their mouths. \n Overall, the entire book - which should have been great - was executed in an extremely juvenile way. This would have been great had two 13 year olds written this, but it wasn't. I understand it is a YA novel, but I really don't see this appealing to its main audience. And it certainly is not appealing to anyone outside of the main audience. \n Sadly, what could have been a wonderful novel with a few slightly typical YA quirks turned into something completely different. I kept reading hoping it would get better, but it didn't. I would not advice people to not read this book, I would just say to approach it with caution and a very, very open mind."}

{"text": "You know...I'm actually surprised with myself. I really enjoyed this book more then I thought I would. The first book was alright for me so I decided to give the second book a try and I'm very happy that I did. Book one was good but didn't \"grab at me\" as much as this book did. Not exactly sure why since book one had plenty of things going on. It might of been the fact that Lila annoyed me somewhat in book one but I can say that I liked her character more in this book. I liked the new characters and thought it was a good addition to the book. I feel like I usually have something that bothers me in books I read but I can happily say that I didn't with this book. I'm quite excited to read the next book since this book was left on a cliffhanger. Would recommend this book! 5 stars!"}
{"text": "I loved the first book so much that when I finished it, I immediately started book two. I was held up then. Between practicing for our dance performance for the Employee's Night for the town's fiesta, and work, and binge-watching TV series, I completely neglected reading. I just finished reading this one on the night of the 24th, fingers numb from gripping the kindle ever so tightly because the ending was so thrilling. \n Spoilers up ahead! \n The novel began right where book one ended and I liked it that the author wrote it like that. The children's' adventure to the Peculiar Capital of the world was full of thrills and twists. I enjoyed reading this novel and some of my favorite parts were when they discovered the secret passage through Ms. Wren's menagerie loop, when the children were caught by the Wights before boarding on the train to London and Hugh saved them, when they finally found Ms. Wren, when they thought Ms. Peregrine will finally change to her human form and when the book cover finally made sense. \n Riggs has truly captivated me in his world of Peculiardom. It's just magnificent how he got to think of every detail that would contribute to how fantastic this made up world would be. \n My excitement was built up when I got to the ending, a major cliffhanger awaited me again that had me scrambling to start book three right away. I seriously feel sorry for those who read the second book when it was released and had to wait for months for the third one to come out. I'm glad I waited until book three was released before starting up with this series. \n All in all, book two is exciting and I look forward to meet new characters on book three that have amazing peculiarity. I cannot wait for the movie. I hope September comes fast!"}

{"text": "10--19-2012--I am not finished reading this yet, as I have been busy lately, but I just got to a point in the book that I had to stop and replay over in my head because it was just so funny. Mac invents a new way to keep the Shadows at bay by super gluing brackets that stuck out several inches wide and held little spelunker lights, and Click-It lights, all over a hot pink helmet, and ankle and wrist straps with more flashlights. She turns on every light on her helmet, wrists and ankles, and then reluctantly turns off all thmae lights in the book store to give it a test in pitch darkness. Seeing that the light completely engulfs her, she was ecstatic, calling it the MacHalo. Before she knew it, she turned on her iPod and began to run around dancing in the dark, jumping up and down furniture, stabbing fake Shadows and singing along to the music, really making a complete fool of herself. Then, she rolls around to a tall shadow and trails off mid-song looking up to see it was Barrons, who had watched the entire peculiar dance around the book store with this ridiculous contraption on her head, and this is the first time we ever get to see Barrons laugh, and not just laugh, but explode hysterically. I love it! I just LOVE IT!----- \n -------- \n 10-21-2012-Writing a review later! Going straight to the next book, right now! What an ending!"}
{"text": "Besides the fact that I'm mostly shocked, I don't entirely know how to feel. I don't even know if I liked the ending. This book was great and had my heart racing several times but it was all, I felt, a huge built up for the next book. In my opinion, this was one of those transition books that, with the exception of several key things, was not all that. \n I'm thrilled to have learned so much more about Warner and I'm sure in the next book we are going to learn a lot more. I love him. More than Adam, maybe. Mostly because he's that messed up love that we all fall for. As to the future of the story, though, I feel she's meant to end up with Adam. It's only common sense. I've never read a trilogy where they introduce the main love in the first book and then completely change it after. So yeah...team Warner...regardless of the fact that it won't happen. \n Shatter Me left me begging for the second book. This book left me...nothing. I still feel like I'm where Shatter Me ended and something big is supposed to happen. Let's see."}

{"text": "3.5 stars. Everyone was telling me I would hate this book, and I did not! While it did have its faults, I enjoyed what it was trying to do and the general theme, even if the execution failed at times. It is a Beauty and the Beast/Hades & Persephone hybrid with some folklore mixed in. I cannot hate it. \n A review to come when I've fully collected my thoughts!"}
{"text": "I'm a little late in reading this, I realize - the sequel is now out, and here I am just getting to it. I remember when \"The Magicians\" came out, critics likened it to \"Harry Potter, but with older kids.\" Of course, the fans called it \"Harry Potter, but with older kids!\" I guess it was whether you used an exclamation mark that made the difference. \n Personally, I found the novel a little uneven. Prior to going off to magic university, I liked the protagonist, Quentin. At school he was a jerk, but ok, not following some of your decisions or comments, a little out of the blue, but I can move along past the angst of entering a new world. By the end of the book I cared less and less about his choices, what he was doing, or even why. I cared more for the secondary characters than for Quentin, and I never got that emotional bond that's supposed to tie you to book and make it impossible to put down. \n The coolest part of the book was the laying out of the Narnia like story the characters grew up with, and then interacting with the real thing. But even here the story was uneven. Some of it was the gritty underbelly of a pseudo-Narnia you know is lurking in the shadows, but then it stopped and became all quick brushstrokes again, glossing over any sense of depth and leaving it all feeling hollow. \n The parts of this novel that were good, were really, really good. Sadly, the parts that weren't dragged this down a couple of stars in my opinion."}

You know, I wasn't sure that Rachel Caine's Morganville Vampires series could get any better than it did in the last book Ghost Town. But I was shockingly surprised. \n In book 10 of the series, Shane is having his usual anger management issues, but they seem to be worse than normal. He's attacking Michael for no reason. He thinks Claire is cheating on him with Myrinn, and he accuses Eve of being a fang banger. Jeez, Shane take a chill pill would you?"}
{"text": "Couldn't put it down!! So good! Thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a little too predictable, hence the 4 star instead of 5 rating."}
{"text": "If you read Shiver and didn't enjoy it, this is most certainly is not going to change your opinion on the the writing or plot line. If you enjoyed Shiver this will just make you fall in love with the characters and become more involved with the story then the first novel. If paranormal YA romance novels are not your thing then Linger won't change your mind on reading them. \n The problems that I encountered in Shiver are addressed here. Grace's parents seem to be a bit more aware of situations going on in their house. This was a MAJOR problem for me as I couldn't understand why the parents were so out there and not knowing what was going on. I can't give away too much without the bulk of the story being ruined but this is definitely addressed in this novel. The timing issue was also addressed and elements seemed to flow a lot smoother then they did in Shiver. \n Linger like Shiver is 80% teenage love/angst and 20% actual plot and story line. Readers should be prepared for a bunch of lovey dovey kissing, cooing and teenage romance. Besides that Linger is very much a middle novel, it contains just enough information to resolve some of the questions from the first book but really sets up for a third book. Be prepared to be left with a massive cliffhanger which won't be addressed until the third book hits shelves. \n Putting aside the teenage love, the actual plot element of Linger was a bit predictable. When Grace started to show symptoms I knew instantly where the story was going to go. As I had guessed all of my predictions did come true. I don't know if this is from reading so many books or if it was really that transparent. This problem led me to enjoy the book a little less then I did with Shiver. \n All the characters that were present in Shiver are still present in Linger, except there is an introduction of a new character, Cole. This new character was my favorite part of the novel. Cole was new, fresh and added a new plot thread. Everything else in the novel tended to come across to me as if I had read it somewhere or was just like Shiver. \n Overall, I enjoyed Linger not as much as I enjoyed Shiver but it was a decent read.I await to see what happens in the 3rd novel. In the end, Maggie Stiefvater's writing is just as beautiful and lyrical as her previous novels and she really knows how to draw a teenage romance that'll make readers wish that they were a part of."}

Butcher keeps getting more inventive with his world, and he's toned down some of Harry's groan-worthy qualities. The side characters are introduced better and feel more fleshed out and necessary."}
{"text": "It's a clever setup and there are some nice moments in the opening third. \n And that's it. \n Far too much of this falls over my threshold of humour and frequently appears spiteful. Digs are had at everything from mild, the writer for example, to excoriating, the fantasy genre and publishing in general. \n I was disappointed with the much heralded dark ending. It's hard to pull off and he really doesn't make it. He pulls a few sleights of hand to tie everything up in a satisfactory fashion but they are either too late or jar too much to be effective. \n Ultimately it's hard to care about any of the characters and without that there is very little to distract you from a series of well worn tropes. The same hackneyed elements that he takes a shot at early on. \n It's a shame because, as I said, the general idea is a good one, but clumsily executed, muddying the waters with a number of plot elements that really don't hang well with the degree of vitriol poured on the targets of his scorn. Is it a parody in reaction to one question too many of \"Where do your ideas come from?\" A reaction to the excesses of the \"next great thing\" publishing pulls out from time to time? A Scoop for this generation's book mills? You really do wonder what some of these people have done to him. \n With a gentler touch this would work better, in the vein of Pratchett (one of the few names he merely sniffs at rather than kicks) or even at full throttle, Robert Rankin perhaps."}
{"text": "Do you like a story about Shifters - Vampires - Werewolves and throw in a little mystery? well then this book is exactly what you are looking for. Mariana Thorn has done an awesome job of throwing everyone into this story plus hate groups that hate anything that is not human. Natalya is a weretiger and doesn't remember a lot of her past - she works for PIB as an agent. Not giving any spoilers away but this is one book that once you pick it up you won't want to put it down - it grabs you the minute you start reading and you just want to find out what happens - be ready to chuckle at some of the things that these characters do. Can't wait to read the next book in this awesome series. I would definitely recommend this to everyone."}
{"text": "How can you not like a book where the main character urinates into a castle and on a princess to save her from a fire? \n In this book Lemuel Gulliver enbarks on many journeys full of adventure, danger and mystery. Gulliver continually sets off on voyages to new worlds and each time ends up in strange lands, each different from the last. He spends extended time in these lands, learns their language, politics, culture and their way of life. \n In each place he goes he finds both friends and enemies, good and bad and all of this affects how he views his people back home in England. He starts off a cheery optimist and by the end of the book, can't stand humans at all. It's interesting to see how this character develops and finds a way to survive with minimal damage throughout the years. \n It is my understanding that Gulliver's Travels is meant to be a parody on human nature and tales from travellers and I think Swift does this well. He combines these themes together to teach us about society, government and religion through a bigger picture."}
{"text": "Baci immortali e il romanzo auto conclusivo della talentuosa Taylor Laini,sul quale avevo riposto grandi aspettative...di fatto puntualmente deluse! \n La trama mi ha incuriosita e della Laini avevo gia letto \"La chimera di Praga\",romanzo che ho semplicemente adorato,ma in Baci Immortali nonostante lo stile inconfondibile dell'autrice e il mix di fantasy e storie maledette,ho faticato e non poco a terminare questa lettura! \n Complice a mio avviso e stata la suddivisione in tre storie del romanzo,tre storie diverse con protagonisti che hanno in comune solo il fatto di essere vittime di una tremenda maledizione. \n * La prima storia e un breve racconto,la protagonista e Kitty una liceale che sogna di essere piu carina e disinibita proprio come le sue coetanee,detesta il suo aspetto fisico e trova imbarazzante le stranezze della propria famiglia.Infatti chiamare stramba la famiglia di Kizzy e dir poco...oscure maledizioni,credenze popolari di oltre un secolo fa,uniti a riti e superstizioni rendono Kizzy tutto fuorche una normale adolescente!Kizzy sogna continuamente di cambiare e desidera l'amore,quel tipo di amore che riesca strapparla dalle sue origini.Proprio di questi sogni si nutrono i Goblin,creature spaventose che rubano le anime con un solo bacio e sono attratte proprio dalle ragazze come Kizzy! \n * La seconda storia,la mia preferita,narra di Anamique vittima di una maledizione dalla nascita,chiunque ascolti la sua voce perde la vita all'istante.La storia di Anamique e un mix di coincidenze e magia,una vita scandita dal silenzio e dalla moltitudine di suoni e parole chiusi nella sua mente.Una voce sublime tenuta in gabbia e un soldato sopravvissuto alla grande guerra,si incontreranno grazie ad un diario dimenticato sui vagoni di un treno...coincidenze o fato? Una protagonista maledetta da un incantesimo e la forza di un sentimento che la portera fin all'inferno per riuscire a riscattare un destino avverso! \n * La terza ed ultima storia e quella che mi ha coinvolta meno,per via del background troppo astruso dei protagonisti che non riescono a far decollare la storia. Mab ed Esme sono madre e figlia in fuga dai Druj,demoni senza anima malvagi e in cerca di corpi e anime da possedere.La storia ha continui cambi di pov,e rimandi al passato che spesso fanno perdere il filo del racconto,ma la cosa che piu mi ha infastidita e il non riuscire a capire il corso degli eventi e le pseudo spiegazioni fornite dai protagonisti a riguardo! Spesso saltavo con gli occhi le ripetitive descrizioni di fatti o persone nei quali puntualmente l'autrice si dilungava,rendendo la lettura noiosa e facendo scemare il mio scarso interesse! Non approfondiro ulteriormente la descrizione dei fatti per non spoilerare,ma proprio quest'ultimo ha fatto si che togliessi una stellina al voto finale. \n Le atmosfere che la Laini descrive non riescono a convincermi del tutto,la maledizione che accomuna le tre protagoniste pur essendo diversa ad ogni racconto,non riesce a costituire un elemento interessante.Il primo racconto e breve e per nulla interessante ed il finale sembra troppo affrettato,perche non riesce a dare una degna conclusione alla storia.Ho l'impressione che l'autrice abbia avuto fretta o si sia stancata di andare oltre! \n Il secondo e il mio preferito fra i tre:una trama interessante e non scontata che mi ha coinvolto fino alla fine. \n Il terzo e secondo me l'apoteosi della prolissita,troppe descrizioni e rimandi al passato poco chiarificatori ai fini della storia,che mi ha annoiata molto! \n In Baci immortali la Laini non si e smentita in quanto a stile narrativo,perche riesce sempre ad essere molto nitida nel descrivere e far immaginare le ambientazioni che racconta.Ma,a mio avviso,pecca in argomentazioni trattate,forse dipende dal fatto di aver suddiviso la storia in tre racconti o di aver incentrato tutti e tre sul tema della \"maledizione\",resta il fatto che non sono riuscita a provare empatia con i personaggi delle storie. \n Non riesco a dare a questa letture piu di 2 stelline,nonostante abbia apprezzato lo stile dell'autrice,le storie e i protagonisti non hanno saputo catturare la mia attenzione come avevo sperato! \n Voto:2 stelle"}

{"text": "I'm pushing toward a 3.5 star. The writing was clean and had a nice flow. Movement from person to person was necessary, but ddn't come together until about 50% in. Once all of these characters crossed that line, I was really needing to know what happens. Blue is a sweet, eccentric girl who has been sheltered by her Mother. She holds power within her spirit that makes connections for others stronger. I believe that she also draws people to her.This is a book about discovery of self, of magic, and of finding your own way to do the right thing. \n Something held me back from loving this. I just didn't connect. Perhaps there is too much innocence? Too much nonchalance? This is very YA. A great mystery and ghost story."}
{"text": "This book was right up my ally! You guys know how much I love the evil, dark, female characters in books. Cas Lowood is basically the new and improved cool ghostbuster, in modern day. At first I mean, how serious can this book be with a ghost hunter traveling across the country with his witchy mom and weird cat? Little did I know that this was going to be a gruesome, dark twisted story about Anna, whom is literally dressed in blood; the title and cover don't lie to you! Come on, the ratings and reviews can talk for themselves, this is Kendare Blake's most reviewed and rated best-seller worthy book! So if you haven't read it yet? Read it. You won't regret it. \n Cas had been killing since he was 14! 14!!! That's a crazy childhood to have and to then top it all off, his father dies. Well, Cass makes his dad proud by inheriting the hunter's mysterious and dangerous athame, and he goes to town finishing what his father had started. Until, he meets Anna. Never has he encountered nor heard of a spirit so powerful and angry. Anna was killed in 1958. While walking to prom in her beautiful white dress, her throat was slit, blood covered her body entirely, thus earning her the name, Anna Dressed in Blood. It's described in the novel as: \n \"Someone cut her throat, but that's an understatement. Someone nearly cut her head clean off. They say she was wearing a white party dress, and when they found her, the whole thing was stained red. That's why they call her Anna Dressed in Blood.\" \n Pretty gruesome and frightening stuff. I'd be pretty angry too with what Anna had to really go through that night. This was an interesting book because we didn't only get to read and learn about Cas, being our protagonist. Instead, we also got to learn a lot about Anna; her background, past, personality, why she is the way she is. It was said in the novel that she had been tied to her house and has never been able to step a foot past her front porch. Being as this is a legend and known to the townspeople, many have tried to check it out for silly pranks, and only 27 have gone in, and have never been seen alive again. I loved her character because she wasn't black and white, she was a gruesome killer yet a victim at the same time, evil yet innocent. It really put things into perspective about morality and I loved how Cas handled the situation. Also, there is a huge twist at the end about the real reason why Anna died, and it puts a whole new meaning on cruel and thriller. \n This book is actually in talks about being turned into a movie!!! And the director being the one and only.... Stephenie Meyer.... this should be interesting. Though i'm still excited! \n IF you liked this review, check out more YA and other genre books on my blog! \n http://keepcalmandloveboooks.blogspot.ca"}

{"text": "I thought I knew what to expect from this book when I went in, but Butler managed to subvert my expectations at every turn. The story opens when our protagonist awakens badly injured in a cave with no memory of who she is or how she got there. I expected that the book would be the story of her solitary quest to find her place in an uncaring world, but that was wrong. As she meets first one friendly person and then more and more, the scope of the book gradually widens from one lonely cave in the middle of nowhere to a whole world society, most of whom are well-meaning and honorable and sincerely want to help our heroine (whose name we eventually learn is Shori Matthews) in any way they can. Of course there are bad guys in the story, ones who caused Shori's injuries in an attempt on her life and are hell-bent on finishing the job they started, but we never get the sense that they're going to win. Butler's tone is gentle and life-affirming but also eminently logical, and her prose is clear as a bell through the whole thing. \n My only regret? The book doesn't come to much of an ending at all, and I have a feeling Butler intended this to be the first book of a new series. Unfortunately, she died not long after it was published, so the only way I'll ever find out what happened to Shori is to make up the rest of her story myself."}
{"text": "The Trouble With Witches is a cute, fast read. The main characters are quite appealing. The story is narrated by Ophelia Jensen - a small town librarian who is psychic and a witch and who seems to have a hobby of solving crimes. Ophelia has a powerful partner in her adventures - her gifted 74 year old grandmother, Abby. And a good friend and co-worker, Darci, who wants to be included in their cases. And a dog named Lady and a cat named Queenie (both of who seem to be better judges of character than their owner). This particular mystery involves a missing girl and the mysterious group that she moved in with shortly before her family lost contact with her. Ophelia and her crew head off to a remote lake in Minnesota to investigate the problem head-on. I enjoyed reading this book and probably would have given it four stars except for one annoying characteristic. The narrator and other characters spend too much time referring back to previous stories in this series. I would normally be out looking for the other books but feel like so much plot was revealed that it would spoil the mysteries."}
{"text": "When I read Stargirl by Jerry Spinelli, I got so intrigued by stargirl's personality. she's so interesting. so mysterious. so peculiar. so when i found out that the sequel (Love, Stargirl) is on her point of view, I am ecstatic. I picked it up as soon as possible because I want to know her; I want to see what's inside her mind; what makes her who she is. I finished the book anticipating for the Stargirl I know. But I didn't found her. She's different. Something's missing. The part I want to know is missing. \n And that's what this book is like. The Warner I know from Shatter Me is different from the Warner in this book. I doubt that maybe it's because he's just really that good in hiding his emotions and pretending to be a sadist asshole in the first one that Juliette didn't notice he's really a kind-hearted broken boy..? \n Warner appeared as a dangerous, psycho in Shatter Me. And in this one all of a sudden he became a sympathetic, soft, emo boy? wat It's like the author's trying so hard to salvage what was left of warner's goodness because lots of readers took interest in him. SO she tried to make him as desirable as possible. So that more people will root for him and the love-triangle will be more interesting. Yeah? \n Anyway, I can say that I liked the writing style in this one compare to the first. Thank fudge there's no more 'poetic' lines (not that much anymore - since there's still her diary entries) For I hated Juliette's mad musings. \n lol at the chapter 22 though. just when i thought that the poor boy's finally having a normal teenage guy kind of dream haha. poor warner :p \n Also one last thing. Warner always makes his father sound like the worst man ever. As if Warner's a saint. *scoff* There's this line: \n I look up, my eyes carefully devoid of emotion. I hate his face. I can't stand to look at him for too long; I don't like experiencing the full impact of how very inhuman he is. He is not tortured by what he does or how he lives. In fact, he enjoys it. He loves the rush of power; he thinks of himself as an invincible entity. \n If my memory serves me right, from what I can remember, Warner was said to be a man who loves power and control in the previous book. So what is this hypocrisy? \n I still like him as a villain though. x"}
{"text": "La segunda parte de la trilogia nos adentra aun mas en el universo de Lesath y a pesar de que tiene algunos fallos, mejora en cuanto al primero. \n Los personajes siguen siendo muy inmaduros y las relaciones son abruptas, pero comenzamos a ver mejor sus caracteres y como piensan. \n Hay varios plot-twist que le dan mayor interes a la historia y el ritmo es mas constante. Ademas ya no contamos con los errores gramaticales de la edicion anterior. \n Creo que Tiffany ha mejorado, pero hay momentos en los que todo se vuelve confuso por la manera en que se narra o por la falta de coherencia. \n Aun asi es un avance y espero que el tercero pueda al menos mantenerse."}

While the author may have made inadvertent errors, it is difficult not to cringe at them while encountering basic mistakes. Kusum and Kolabati are not Bengali names, nor is the turban worn in Bengal. Also \"Hindutvu\"(sic) is not target for right wing nationalists and demons are called \"Rakshash\" not \"Rakoshi\". I think this is due to an inherent bias in me as a reader but these additions do not hamper the story in any way. \n Jack starts off the book with an appointment with an Indian diplomat, Kusum, who needs his help in recovering an artifact that was stolen from his mother. Jack reluctantly agrees even though he has to accept another case related to his former girlfriend Gia. Gia's rich aunt has disappeared without a trace and the police are unable to help. Due to his previous experience with a British officer ,Jack is recommended to both the incidents. Jack finds and returns the artifact on time and gets to meet Kolabati, Kusum's Sister. A quick chemistry develops between them and this seems to irk Kusum. Gradually the story moves forward telling us about the past of both Jack and Kusum. After about halfway into the book, the real demons appear and the story moves at full speed. Jack encounters the demons and finds out the Gia's daughter Vicky might be the next target. He has to move quickly to save Vicky's life while finding out more secrets about the Indian siblings. \n The book is recommended for fantasy and horror lovers that like to read light action."}
{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n I adore Cat and Bones. I love their relationship, the thrilling plots, the spicy writing, the humorous banter, and Frosts' ability to make you care about the characters- even the secondary ones. \n As much love as I have towards this series in general however, that is how much I LOATHED this book. I hated the path the plot took, I felt that Cat and Bones each displayed the worst aspects of their personalities for almost the entire book, I hated the whole Gregor issue- which was wrong on so many levels (borderline statutory rape/sexual coercion, and just general ickiness). I hated how the situations Frost put them in seemed to me that it took something special away from Cat and Bones' relationship. I detested the way Cat and Bones acted towards each other, saying and doing things that could only partially be taken back. Basically I spent most of this book just wishing that I could unread it."}

{"text": "I don't know! I read it when I was supposed to be doing other things and enjoyed it. Had the feel of the middle book of a trilogy where lots of time was spent \"Leveling up\" (with the sex goddess, with the buddhist/spartan warriors, in the court of his Maer, leading a team of mercenaries, etc.) but I never got tired because Rothfuss created a world I could escape into. However, the story feels like it is getting unwieldy and saggy and one worries that this inexperienced author created a character he can't control and a story he can't wrap up. We'll see!"}
{"text": "I really enjoyed this book and would have LOVED it had it been about 200 pages less. There were so many side stories that it got my mind wandering and not caring about the book. So many characters had to tell their side and we'd follow them. And every so often some overly cute thing would happen or a new object would jump out. I enjoyed it but felt it dragged and could see kids getting bored easily."}

{"text": "Smoldering Hunger is the latest story in the Dark Kings which focuses on Darius and Dr. Sophie Martin. I wasn't sure what to expect, since you get a glimpse in Passion Ignites as well as the Dark Alpha's Claim. The story moves along nicely, filled with a budding romance and dragons abound. \n It's been seven years since she barricaded her heart. Focused on her career and helping others, Sophie Martin refuses to let any man get the better of her. That is until Darius walks into her life claiming he is not a good man. \n Not concerned with finding his mate, Darius' past continues to haunt him, preventing him from getting too close to Sophie. But his baser instincts are drawn to the passionate doctor. Unable to stop himself from seeing her, he finds out Ulrik is interested. Determined to find out Ulrik wants with Sophie, he is forced to confront the Dragon King. \n While the story focuses on the main characters, the secondary characters continue to grow, some who already have their stories told, while others we are still waiting for. With glimpses of Rhi cooping with her feelings and wanting to be loved, I am looking forward to her story. Balladyn is determined more than ever Rhi is his. The Reapers remain hidden throughout the story with an occasional blip. Ulik is still scheming to bring down all of the Kings before going after Con. Smoldering Hunger can be read as a standalone; however it is part of an ongoing series. Smoldering Hunger was provided by Netgalley for an honest review."}

{"text": "I believe this is the first book I've read in the Young Wizards series, though I'm aware of Diane Duane, and I've read some of her other books--but not in this series, which I'm only now aware of. Games Wizards Play caught my attention because I like the idea of the mentors and their mentees and their puzzling backgrounds. The premise is intriguing, and I enjoyed the book. The characters are interesting and fun and sometimes annoying (Grow up, Penn!), and the author filled in the background well. (I'm sorry I never got to know Ponch, and like the characters in the book, I wondered what happened to Roshaun.) I like Spot and Bobo and the Planetaries (cool idea!) So many imaginative characters and interesting premises. Great family and friends relationships--and believable. (I always appreciate that.) This story kept me reading. I don't want to spoil the rescues, especially at the end, or the new characters. I really like this book and plan to reread it. Recommended."}

{"text": "I thought Flame Moon was entertaining and a nice change of pace using mythology as a background. The book is well written and the author does a good job with dialogue and describing the environment. One of the big problems I had was the relationship development between the two main characters. One moment Skye was just tossing around the idea of maybe being more interested in Aiden than she expected, and then next they were all over each other pledging their love and devotion. \n Nonetheless, Flame Moon has piqued my interest and I wouldn't mind reading the next book in the series to see what happens."}
{"text": "Holy shit. Oh, my gosh. That ending. It was so EPIC. The story was epic and the characters were fleshed out and well-written. There was never a boring part and I think I really need to start watching the show (at least season 1) so I can actually see the epic battles and sword fights taking place. The hype for this book is well placed. So many plot twists. A lot of political intrigue that I wasn't expecting but very much enjoyed. Looking forward to the next books."}
{"text": "See full review for Living Dead in Dallas by: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n Another thing I liked about the TV show over the books? Lafayette Reynold lives. Living Dead in Dallas starts off with Sookie finding Lafayette's dead body in Andy Bellefleur's car. Lafayette was my favorite character in True Blood and after only a few interactions in Dead Until Dark, I kind of wished Harris had kept him around more. Anyway, Lafayette is dead, probably because of some outrageous parties that he had been going to recently, but Andy is still a suspect in his murder. The murder though gets pushed back because Sookie and Bill are needed elsewhere. \n Sookie made a promise to Eric in the last book that he could use her ability as long as he wanted to if he let a human prisoner go. He agreed and is making good on Sookie's promise. A vampire nest in Dallas needs use of Sookie's ability to find a missing member of their nest. What Sookie stumbles across in her search for answers is not at all what she expected. Turns out that the missing vampire was taken by an organization called the Fellowship of the Sun - a church of followers who believe that vampires shouldn't exist and need to be taken care of permanently. Sookie goes to the Fellowship to figure out where exactly the missing vampire is, but is betrayed by her counterpart. As usual, Sookie find her way out thanks to help from a vampire and another were creature, but the Fellowship isn't quite done yet."}
{"text": "I was skeptical of Clarity, if only because paranormal wears on me quite quickly. Especially with summer around the corner - the season for contemporary (in my opinion anyway). \n I loved the family dynamic in Clarity. Each of her family members are normal besides their paranormal gift, and I loved that they have a family business based around it. And Clare and Perry aren't exactly happy about it all of the time - which made them real people with paranormal abilities, which definitely isn't always the case in books like these. Paranormal abilities tend to take over characters so I really appreciate when it doesn't. \n The mystery in the book is fun, a murder that Clare is asked to help solve. Makes it kind of suspenseful (of course) - not the most complicated mystery, but was still fun to read about. \n Clarity is overall quite enjoyable. I'll be looking for more from Kim Harrington!"}

{"text": "Alec MacAiden is a NYC detective with a photographic memory and a long history with weird shit happening. He's had several close calls with death that were averted by inexplicable means. While chasing down a suspect one rainy night he's disturbed by the perp knowing not only his true name, Ailig, but also by the claim that he must go to Cronin, and find some key, to avert war. Oh, and by this stranger exploding into dust in his very arms. \n This is only further compounded by Cronin appearing at the police station and taking Alec away by quantum leap. Alex can't control his feelings around Cronin, and this is explained, much to Alec's dismay, by Alec being Cronin's FATED mate. And, hilariously, that's even more upsetting than learning that Cronin and his two trusted confidants, Eiji and Jodis, are all centuries-old vampires. \n Really, it's the writing (not the vamps) that sparkles here. The humor and pace are both brisk, and excellent. Alec doesn't like the idea that he is matched to Cronin without his consent. Not that Cronin isn't delicious. Because he is. He's over 6 feet of sexy ginger vampire, originally from Scotland. He is also Old World in manners and sensibilities. And he's thwarted in his desire because sexual relations with Alec will turn him into a vampire, and a new prophesy has a very human Alec sitting squarely in the midst of a brewing war. \n I really enjoyed this one! The historical references were seamlessly interwoven and the new enemy on the horizon is interesting and dangerous. I loved how Alec took all Cronin's revelations with aplomb and humor--and I loved how Cronin and Alec took advantage of the few days they had to make the most of their budding relationship. The sexual tension was delicious, and the advancement of their \"courtship\" was so sweet. The battle scenes were fantastic, and the story was completely wound up in the resolution. The sequel will focus on a new foe, which was excellent."}
{"text": "See full review for Shadowland at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n Susannah Simon has never been normal. From a very young age she has been able to see and talk to the dead. As she got older and when her dad died, she started figuring out that these ghosts came to her to help them move on to the next life or whatever. Of course, because of this she's gotten into a lot of trouble back in New York. But all of that is going to change now that her mother has remarried and they're relocating to Carmel, California. With the new step-dad, she gets three new step-brothers (who she has already nicknamed Sleepy, Dopey, and Doc) and a house that is a historical monument and has the ghost to prove it. \n His name is Jesse and he haunts Suze's bedroom. And really he is the least of her problems. It turns out that the only reason she was able to start at the school that her step-brothers go to is because a girl died over the winter break. The girl, Heather, though hasn't left the Mission Academy. She's still haunting it and despite Father Dominic's (the principal of the school) best efforts, she is not moving on. And now that Suze is there, Heather feels that she is taking her place and she is very, very angry. \n Okay, so Remembrance (book 7 of The Mediator series) comes out in less than a week, which means that it's time for my re-read of the series to prepare. I'll be honest this is like the third time I've re-read these books in the last 10 years and it gets better with each re-read."}

{"text": "4-4.5 \n Wow. Well, shit. \n I don't usually read fantasy (I was told this was paranormal at first, but I researched and found out that warlocks and such is fantasy). Still, I would kind of classify this as paranormal. Idk you read it and let me know what it is please. \n Anyhow, I usually don't read this genre, but holy crap I loved this story. Gabriella (the MC) is a cool chick, I can see myself hanging out with her. She didn't annoy me, though I did spend 60% of the book wanting to shake her and tell her what I knew that she didn't. I fully expected this to be a typical \"insta-love romance\". I appreciated the fact that Gabriella took it as \"insta-lust\" . I really really appreciated that. \n \"Why would any somewhat sane, shrewd young woman deem it necessary to completely throw herself at a man she's only known for a week? \n \"Between the champagne and tequila shots, my head is swimming and my inhibitions have taken a dive along with my already questionable morals.\" Tell me you haven't been there. Or don't bc if you haven't been there...I'll corrupt you. \n She's trying to find herself throughout the book. Trying to figure out who/what she is and who/what she should become. \n I appreciated the lost journey she went through because we all go through that. Hell, some of us are still going through that. I loved that she wasn't weak and didn't take crap from anybody. \n Dorian, Dorian, Dorian. This guy made me swoon. Like, all out, butterflies in my stomach, swoon . This doesn't happen often (really, it doesn't). He's such an enigma that it should be difficult for you to connect with him, but the way he is written, he just draws you in and makes you sit on edge waiting for the next time he comes out. \"No one has ever moved me like you. Ever. The feeling you give me is insane. It's unnatural. You intoxicate me.\" \n \"Cut the shit. I'm not some giggling schoolgirl and I don't take kindly to games. So save the googly eyes and phone sex voice.\" BAM! \n So Dorian has his secrets, Gabriella seems to think she has her secrets. \n \"You see Gabriella. Darkness is not always what it seems. It can appear frightening at first but there is truly nothing to fear. Sometimes the light can blind us from the truth.\" So many times I wanted to hit Gabriella upside the head and say \"PAY ATTENTION!\" \n Anyhow, I kind of need you all to read this story so we can discuss. Please and thank you. \n I will leave you with another quote (seriously, ever since I discovered how to highlight I am on a total quoting frenzy). \n \"I am not light. I am not Dark. I'm his.\" <3 So am I, Gabi, so am I. \n Also, it's not that this book leaves you with a cliffhanger, I don't think I would classify this as one, but O.M.G. I need to know what is going to happen!"}
{"text": "First off... \n I won a copy of this through a First Reads giveaway. This book was one I have been waiting for all year. I have loved every single Kate Daniels novels, and I literally did a fist pump in the air, danced a jig, or what-have-you when I received notification that I had won a copy. \n I have not been unhappy with any in this series, and Magic Rises did not disappoint, at all. \n I loved how the location changed. I love the Georgia setting, but a change of venue was welcomed and refreshing. \n I loved how there is relationship conflict between characters. I like when characters have to face trouble, internal or external. I feel it allows the series/book to progress instead of stagnate. \n I loved the snarky/smart-ass dialogue. I know Kate is famous for her zingers, but I realized I was laughing more with this one. Kate was not the only one, though. I love how authors, dealing with heavy, dark situations can insert a bit of levity now again seamlessly. It all comes together to result in one really well-rounded story. \n Pacing was great. I didn't get bored or skim, which sometimes happens...sometimes even with some of my favorites. The story started strong and continued through until the end. I wasn't shocked by how the story played out however. Saw some of it coming way before \"everyone\" else. That doesn't really bother me though because Andrews' writing really got me invested in the overall story and characters. \n Cast of characters was well-rounded but not overwhelming. Some books, specifically series, introduce so many characters that you don't really remember them and they all blur together. They are all memorable and stand-alone in their own right. \n I liked the Hugh conflict a lot. He kind of, ALMOST, got me rooting for him. He instigated a potential problem that really hasn't been addressed yet: Kate will always be separate from the pack. That with Doolittle's reaction to being healed, I think opened up a Pandora's box in Kate's mind. I am really looking forward to seeing this development play out. \n All in all, I love this series. I know that as a series' book count rises that story lines, characters, etc. sometimes start to suck. I've had a couple of series stop appealing to me because they begin to get ridiculous. I am a die-hard, loyal fan to this series and will be (not) patiently waiting for the next!!!"}
{"text": "Crosspost: TheReadingBelle.com \n Anyways, I'll start off with what I didn't like about Truthwitch. There will be minor spoilers in my review. First off, I did not like the world building, which plays a major role in this book. There is a lack of world building, and it was very confusing in the beginning of the story. I would have loved the book a bit more if there was a glossary at the end of the book. There was none. It would have been very helpful for readers. There were many ideas that were put into this book, but not well executed. For example the Origin Wells or the myth of Cahr Awen. Then there is also cleaving...I don't know how to quite describe it myself. It's more like overexerting your power limit and destroying yourself physically and mentally...Well, there's a lot of cleaving in this book. The cleaving reminded me a lot of Shin Sekai Yori (From The New World; an amazing anime that you should totally watch). Also, I would have loved it if there was an explanation of the different types of witches in that world. The powers did remind me of another book series: The Grisha Trilogy. \n In addition, this book was very political. If only the world building was better executed, well then I would have liked it more. The book had bits and pieces of what the world was like before the Twenty Year Truce. I would have liked if the book elaborated to what had caused the nations to go against each other, and also what caused the war. Safi plays a crucial role, since she is a Truthwitch. She is wanted by almost every country in the world because her power is very rare. There are several hints here and there about the upcoming war, and Safi will play a much larger role when it comes to the fight. Hopefully, these issues can get resolved in the sequel. \n Now, what I liked about Truthwitch was the friendship between Safi and Iseult. Safi is the loudmouth and emotional one, while Iseult is emotionless, and very tactical. Safi is usually the one to get them both into trouble. Though Safi manages to mess up a lot, Iseult never abandons her dear friend. \n \"Where's your hair?\" she shouted. \"And what happened to your arm?\" \n \"Cut my hair and got shot with an arrow!\" \n \"Gods below, Iseult! A few hours away and your whole life tumbles through the hell-gates!\" \n \"I might say the same to you,\" Iseult shouted back--though it was getting hard to scream and ride. \"Four opponents on your tail and a ruined dress!\" \n Initially, I didn't like Safi at all, but by the end of the book I ended up loving her. She has a lot of character development and learns what she has to do for the people she loves even if it means sacrificing her freedom. I also like that there different povs in this book. Iseult has her own storyline, and I would like for it to get explored more. I want to know why her race is hated so much and why the leader of her clan wants her dead. I really liked reading her perspective a lot more than Safi's. Also, I want to know how the Puppeteer is able to get in Iseult's mind, which was really creepy. \n Now as for the love interest, I really liked Prince Merik. He won my heart once I read that he was a pirate. Very swoon-worthy, but not as much as my precious Prince Nikolai Lanstov. I really liked his relationship with Safi. Lots of sexual tension between those two. One of my favorite moments had to be the dance off. I loved how cocky Merik was. Another character that I really liked was Aeduan, he's a villain that you're bound to love. \n \"Oh, the Bloodwitch named Aeduan was no longer bored. No longer bored at all. And now he had work to do.\" \n I want to know more about his family's history and how he ended up at the monastery. He is going to play a major role in the later books. He is one of the most interesting characters from this series. I also want to see how his relationship develops with Iseult as well. I didn't really think of them as a couple because I was shipping Aeduan with Prince Leopald, since I really liked their misadventures together. \n I really enjoyed reading Truthwitch, and it's a bit diffucult to get into. Don't give up on it, it's really good! It's very hyped up right now, but it wasn't one of my favorite. I will love to continue reading the series! \n Final Rating: [?][?][?][?]"}
{"text": "For years people have been asking me about Mr Wolfe's Shadow of the Torturer, assuming I had read it and that I enjoyed it. I liked the prose - as I do with all of the author's works which i have read. \n My challenge was that the protangonist is about as exciting as paint primer. His few willful actions were like pulling teeth to me and the rest of the characters seemed grossly hollow and base in their actions. Plus the world lore is beautifull and painfully deep... but the reader is exposed to it like paper cuts and mosquito bites in long fables told to others. Highly frustrating to my reading preferences: give me meat, let me sink my teeth into it."}
{"text": "I've seen the movie and I didn't have any idea that it came from a book! When I learned that it did, I immediately sought out the book and read it. I was in awe. It was haunting and beautiful at the same time. You can never outgrow this even if it is categorized in the children's book section. It is an easy light read and there are no boring moments. It just took me a long time to finish this read because I needed to put it aside to study for my exams. I finished reading this yesterday and I was really scared. The ending of this book screams creepy, creepy, creepy. I would want to spoil some parts but I think it's best not to. I hope you'll read this, it's really worth your time."}
{"text": "This review was written for Joyfully Jay Reviews. \n 4.25 Stars for this contemporary M/M shifter romance. This is the second book in the Little Bite of Love series, and it is highly recommended to read both in order as they are sequential and share characters and plot elements. Be aware this review may have spoilers for the first story. \n Hunter Devin is a fierce Enforcer, a half-wolf/half-husky shifter whose once esteemed position as protector to the husky Alpha has been diminished over the past several generations. Now, he is considered little more than a glorified mutt by the pureblood leaders of his former husky clan. Living in the newly-formed Daegan clan that consists of a few powerful families, Hunter is heartsick over having left his lover, Ari Jannsen, behind. \n Ari's determined to escape his near-captivity. His mother, Skyrah, is determined to ally her family with the Alphas of Hagan clan and is glad to be rid of the half-breed cur who corrupted her precious Ari. Hunter knows if he even approaches Ari's home he will be attacked, and his diminutive Ari may also be caught in the fray. \n Here's what I loved the most: this book has a tense plot. We have big secrets and double-crosses. We have crazed parents, and others finding their way past homophobia. We have caring and compassionate men and women. We have life-or-death battles that kept me flipping the pages. And, we have (a little) magic. The main heat of this book is told in flashback, with Hunter and Ari lamenting the loss of their clandestine love as distance and circumstance separates them. Because we begin with their separation, reading their lovestory is especially poignant. \n Of course, there are skirmishes that nearly wipe out the Daegan clan and their pups. The action here is fast and furious. This is a world on the brink of war, with many players seeking to grasp the leadership of the Hagan clan--not least of which is Trip Hagan's homophobic father. Trip, Boone, Kristoff, and Robbie are right in the thick of this book, which means that reading the series in order is really important. \n I adored the blossoming romance between Ari and Hunter. They are so sweet with each other. As is usual for Cochet's books, the emphasis is on characterization and relationships. All the players in the book are well-drawn and have unique contributions to the story. I was glad that we saw some resolution of the homophobia from the first book, and restoration of broken relationships. The end is sufficient to complete this story, while leaving the door open to another book (my money is on Kristoff finding love!) in this series."}
{"text": "TRANSPARENT is a fast-paced adventure, packed with light Sci-Fi goodness, and a splash of romance. \n Plot premise: In the near future the use of radiation blocking medicine alters the genetics of humanity resulting in mutations that creates superbeings. Some of these mutations are kinda lame. Who really wants blue skin? The ability to mimic the scent of a skunk, anyone? Going once, twice... \n Fiona O'Connell, however, had the (mis) fortune to be born invisible--to a crime kingpin father who figures she's just perfect--as an assassin. With his Charm power, Jonas O'Connell can woo any female to do his bidding, and he's decided that Fi, at 16, should become a cold-blooded killer. So, Fiona goes on the run with her telekinetic mother--trying to escape her first deadly assignment. Thing is, when you're brought up around criminals, it's REALLY hard to trust anyone. \n And, Fiona doesn't. \n Not the kids at the new school who are attempting to befriend her, and especially not her eldest brother, her father's right-hand man and a confirmed killer. In order to survive, she must learn to confide in the super kids she meets, however, and she must also trust that this time her mom won't go crawling back to good old dad. \n The best part of this story, has to be Fiona's sense of humor. She's wry and witty and, due to no one knowing her facial expressions, used to being candid. Of course, author Natalie Whipple stands the invisibility barrier on its head to bring in the romance--which works well. Poor Fi! And, yet the lesson of facing one's fears head-on is subtle and sweet. \n I'd definitely recommend this to upper middle grade and YA readers. It's a great story with fun twists and while it resolves nicely, it's got built-in sequel potential."}
{"text": "FIRST LINE: \"Moth was flying his kite near the aerodrome when he heard the dragonfly crash.\" \n Young Moth had grown up in Calio, the mountain city, dreaming of becoming a Skynight, one of the elite pilots who flew the fragile, beautiful, newfangled flying machines called dragonflies. To the north of Calio stretched the Reach, looking like a sea of fog that never ended. Flat and peaceful, the mists of the Reach flowed all the way to the horizon, and Calio loomed over this vast forbidding expanse like a sentinel standing guard. \n There were numerous tall tales about the lands beyond the Reach, and Moth heard the wildest of them from Leroux. Leroux, had once been one of the legendary Eldrin Knights, had taken guardianship of the ten-year-old when Moth's mother died. At first, Moth had been expecially fascinated by Leroux's stories of the Skylords, but at the grown-up age of thirteen, Moth was becoming increasingly skeptical about the existence of these mysterious, powerful and frightening beings from beyond the Reach. \n When Leroux died, Moth was faced with an impossible task: to protect Lady Esme, Leroux's pet kestrel. And protecting Lady Esme would mean venturing into the forbidden Reach with his best friend Fiona, to find dragons, battle Skylords, and discover the secret hidden within the kestrel herself. \n It would be easy for me to ambiguously rave about Starfinder. As I said before, I loved it. But I know that others found it lacking, so I thought I would specify what I loved, so that you can judge whether you might use the same criteria as I. \n 1. It's intelligent. \n The tone of the book doesn't condescend to readers. The narrative might be a little slow for someone only interested in action, but the metaphors and literary elements are delightful for those who choose to identify them. The language is lyrical but not flowery, with lots of good SAT words sprinkled throughout, in only appropriate places. \n 2. It's original....but familiar. \n The Hindenberg meets Fantasyland? Heck, yeah. I never expected, plot-wise, what would happen next. The characters were complex enough to keep me guessing. And the Reach itself is a magical land created wholly by Marco, rather than lifted from the idea of some other one. \n While the plot and characters are original, Starfinder, for me, had the feel of so many of my favorite worlds and authors and characters: Narnia, Neverland, Naussica of the Valley of the Wind, Anne McCaffrey, Lewis Carroll, Howl's Moving Castle, Xena - to name a few. In other words, this story felt very comfortable, both exciting and familiar, and that added to its charm. \n 3. It's got heart. \n Marco is careful not to reduce any of the conflicts in Starfinder to dualisms. There are many shades of grey, and the reader is given a chance to think about what his or her own response might be even as Moth or Fiona make theirs. There's a great deal of affection - parental love, friendship - without romance playing much of a role in this book (other than, for example, a husband-wife who are obviously fond of each other.) Whatever the emotions, Marco elicits them organically, without resorting to cliches for loss or joy or anger or exhilaration. \n Starfinder would make a great present for boys around ages 12 to 14 who like to read, or for reluctant boy readers ages 12 to 18. I wouldn't buy this for a girl unless I knew she was open to the strong female characters and didn't expect mushy romance. But everyone - everyone - should at least check it out from the library."}

{"text": "Non so veramente da dove iniziare! \n Questo libro si e rivelato qualcosa di unico, sconvolgente e originale tanto da sorprendermi e incantarmi completamente. Una storia che rievoca e traduce in chiave moderna il classico senza tempo de \"La bella e la bestia\", ma non aspettatevi una copia sbiadita e noiosa... assolutamente no. \n Rosamund Hodge rivisita il classico Disney e lo racconta mescolando un po' di steampunk, ambientazioni oniriche e descrizioni degne della mente geniale di Carroll in Alice in wonderland. \n Reale o onirico? \n Crudele o giusto? \n Incanto o incubo? \n Amore, odio, tradimenti e redenzione. \n Questa storia ha un pizzico di tutto cio, e un mondo in continuo divenire in cui la realta spesso si confonde con l'illusione o l'incubo peggiore. \n La Hodge racchiude tra le pagine di questa storia l'incanto di un sogno e l'efferatezza di un patto che distrugge ogni cosa. Crudelta, bellezza, e un mistero che avvolge un intero stato come una maledizione. \n Lo stile e squisitamente elegante, ricco di mistero e riferimenti onirici. La mitologia greca usata come filo conduttore per legare il passato al presente e svelarne i misteri. Una lettura che ti avvolge e intrappola, un vaso di Pandora che non ti permette di pensare ad altro, se non il volere sapere cosa succedera nel capitolo successivo. Un castello che contiene al suo interno un intero mondo... \n Chiavi che aprono porte che un istante dopo non ci sono piu... \n Riavvolgere il tempo e sacrificare l'amore? \n Oppure ascoltare la voce dell'egoismo? \n Incantevole!"}

{"text": "DNF 68% \n This book wasn't for me. It's labeled as YA but it felt it was even for a younger. I agreed to review it due to the blurb, which sounded promising but when I reached the 70% mark and everything made no sense I lost my interest and gave up. \n The writing didn't really captivate me - this includes the characters, dialogues, and attempt to create a mystical feeling. It felt stilted and dull. The book was missing the important LEADING PATH throughout the book to hold a readers attention because now it seems there's a lot of jumping back and forth. The lack of cohesiveness and slow build-up to the story, the important action -the peek of the book- was just not gonna happen. Maybe after the 70 percent there's some enlightening, action etc. going to happen but the author didn't do a successful job keeping my interest on the story or on the faith of the characters. \n ___________________________________ \n Read all my review (A-Z) on the blog \n Like the blog on Facebook"}
{"text": "My favorite stories, whether they are told through movies or books, are most often inspired by Arthurian legends. Meredith Bond has skillfully woven those threads into a new series about the descendants of those well-loved characters from Camelot, and called it, Children of Avalon. \n Book One is \n Air: Merlin's Chalice \n . Set in medieval times, a magical race of people is threatened by witch hunts, and a 200-year-old prophecy that foretells of a threat to all humanity and, specifically, to the Children of Avalon. A young woman, who was left on the doorstep of a church as a baby, is driven from the only home she has ever known for being a witch. She begins a quest to find her true identity, only to discover she is one of the trio mentioned in Merlin's prophecy. On her journey, she encounters risks to her life and her heart, knights in shining armor, and a powerful mortal enemy who will stop at nothing to kill her. Fortunately, she also finds several allies, two of whom are the other Children of Avalon. \n Romance, intrigue, magic-what's not to love about this book! It's wonderful and I'm definitely going to pick up the next book in the series."}
{"text": "See full review for Serpent's Kiss at: http://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.w... \n So, as much as I loved the first novel in this series, Serpent's Kiss was a little bit of a let down. The characters were still their usual witty selves, but the story line was kind of lacking for me. \n At the end of Witches of East End, Fryr - Freya and Ingrid's brother - comes back from Limbo and accuses Killian of being the true person who destroyed the Bifrost, the link between Asgard and Midgard. Freya is sworn to secrecy and is put in charge of trying to find her brother's - who goes by Freddie now - trident. This causes a slight rift to grow between her and Killian and he can't figure out what's going on. Ingrid and her boyfriend Matt are getting along just swimmingly, until he confesses that he doesn't believe in any of that witch stuff. For a good portion of the book, Ingrid overlooks that, she's more concerned with finally losing her virginity - even though she does back out at the end - and it isn't until the aftermath of Thanksgiving dinner that she realizes that maybe Matt and her can't work. Joanna is dealing with not only her husband, Norman, being back but the romantic interest of a guy named Harold as well. But even she gets sucked into something witchy that ends being involved with Freya and Killian."}
{"text": "This is another book that I listened to via the Audible version. I have not read this book previously so the narration was my first experience of the story. \n I'm going to make a claim without really being able to back this up - the audio version was brilliant and really enhanced my enjoyment of this story! Okay, I don't really know if I would have enjoyed it any less if I had read it but I totally adored the narration of this book. \n The characters were totally wonderful and I fell in love with both Whyborne and Griffin. Outwardly Whyborne was so unsure of himself, shy and unassertive, totally lacking self confidence but in reality he was a wonderfully strong man - standing on his own, following his own path in life and supporting himself rather than relying on his well-to-do father. Griffin appears strong and confident but has his own demons and inner torment. Together they are fabulous. \n I am not a huge fan of historical romances and only read a smattering in the paranormal genre so was surprised by how much I liked this book. The style of writing, the speech and the behaviour of all the characters seemed to capture the era perfectly. I particularly liked the formality of interactions between work colleagues and the totally fabulous Christine! \n The story was full of mystery, intrigue and horror as Whyborne and Griffin team up to stop the resurrection of wonderfully descriptive evil monsters. They follow clues, deal with Whyborne's colleagues at the museum, fight off half-human-half-animal creatures, all while their attraction for each other grows. \n Julian G Simmons captured the essence of Whyborne perfectly. The soft spoken quality of his voice, his tone and inflections matched the character of Whyborne and was totally in keeping with the period of the story. \n I can highly recommended the audio version! \n I publish all my m/m reviews on my blog so if you want to see all my m/m reviews in one place come visit at Because Two Men Are Better Than One!"}

{"text": "3.5/5 Stars \n This book was fantastic! I was so excited to read it, and was not disappointed. The beginning was a little slow, and I think some of it was unnecessary to the rest of the plot and definitely could have been cut out, but once I got past that the book flew by! The concept of time travel has always intrigued me, and Alex did a great job with all the nuances. However, I feel like, compared to the beginning section on the boat, the actual time travel/treasure hunt section was way more rushed, and I wished we could have visited more places and spent more time solving the clues in exchange for less time on the ship. It just felt like we found out that we could visit almost any point in time, and that her mom made a really complicated scavenger hunt, but we only ended up going about 5 places. Hopefully there will be more of that in the next one, because the ship sections were probably so Etta could get some info about time travelling from Sophia. I really liked the characters of Etta and Nicholas and their relationship, and the way they balanced each other out through the journey. I also appreciated the way that the racism that Nicholas experiences in various times, including present day, was not glossed over, and was discussed as an issue. The historical details from all the time periods was incredible, and it was so enjoyable to read about all of them. Also, the world itself was extremely well-developed. Overall this was a great book that lived up to my expectations!"}
{"text": "This is a really, really weird book. Since it's the only one I've read by Pamela Dean, I can't tell how much of the weirdness is her writing style and how much comes from the peculiarities of these particular characters.

{"text": "This book's great strength was its depth. You really felt for the characters. The southern backdrop of the story was well done.

The pacing was a bit slow for me and there was a certain question I was dying to know that never got answered by the end of this book about the mortality of one of the main characters. One I can't very well ask on a review if I don't want to spoil the ending. The authors certainly had time to explain it, though, in a book that was over 560 pages long. Over all, I enjoyed it."}

I LOVED the Percy Jackson and the Olympians saga, but the Kane Chronicles felt a bit childish to me. The adults in these books were ridiculous. It felt way too childish, wich probably means I'm a bit old for these books. Don't get me wrong, I think they are cute, but the fact that there is not a prophecy or something else to explain the fact that the world depends on who little kids makes it a bit hard to swallow. That, and how childish one of the point of views is (I'm looking at you Sadie). I liked Carter, and I also liked secondary characters like Anubis and Bast, but couldn't stand Sadie. \n Maybe I just like greek mythology more."}
{"text": "I liked this one, but not so much that I'll read the sequel. I didn't really care all that much about the characters until about half way through the book. The author is amazing with descriptions, that's the main selling point for this series. The way Ms. Clare solved the love triangle was daring. I saw it coming, but then dismissed my instincts because I had a hard time believing the author would actually go there--then she did. \n I won't say anymore because I don't want to give anything away."}
{"text": "DNF 45% \n *I received this copy from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.* Oh my oh my. Where shall I start. I really don't like to give a bad review on ARC copies but I'm going to be honest as always. I got interested in this book because I saw quite a few people excited about getting a ARC copy of this book. My overall description of this book is a book version of a low budget movie with bad graphics. I feel bad saying/writing this but it's true. Oh and don't get me started on how people/genders are talked/described in this book. I know I know. I'm probably making a fuss but it kinda bothered me.

{"text": "This wouldn't have been half the tale if not for the L'Engle's remarkable gift of characterization. Meg's teenaged angst is pitch perfect and yet not overcooked in the least.

There's also a heavy dose of spirituality - heavy but never heavy handed. The text, from the early 60's, hasn't dated in the slightest. Only regret? I didn't read this when I was the right age for it."}
{"text": "I liked this a lot more than I thought I would, but it still has major issues. I decided on a generous three stars because despite technical flaws I actually kind of enjoyed it. \n The positive: \n -Lia. I thought she was going to be a bratty spoiled child that I would despise. She never shirks her duty and seems content to live a quiet village life. It never come across like she is playacting at being a commoner. While I didn't always agree with her choices, they made sense since she is a 17 year old girl. \n -Pauline and to a lesser extent Gwynth and Berdi. It's great to have strong female friendships! With no bitchy female character criticizing the heroine! \n -The romance. I'm a sucker for romance and I knew going into this that this was romance heavy so I was prepared. I liked how it unfolded, and there was no real love triangle or insta-love. Though Lia was obviously attracted to both guys, there was a clear favorite most of the time. \n The negative: \n -An assassin that doesn't assassinate. This is one of my biggest YA fantasy pet peeves! (I'm looking at you Celaena and Shazi) One of our characters is an assassin sent to kill Lia, which he doesn't because...REASONS! \n Which leads us to pet peeve number two: weak character motivation. We're given some piss poor excuse why the assassin doesn't kill Lia. Something about he had to track her down for three weeks so he wanted to make her pay. (It's been a while since I read this so it may not be 100% accurate.) But he never does. Instead, he befriends her, makes himself useful around the inn, carries things for her and falls in love with her. He knows that eventually he's going to have to kill her. Why would anyone do that to themselves especially without a good motivation? The answer is no one would because it's stupid!!! \n -The plot...or lack thereof. Seriously. What's the plot for almost the entire book? Lia serves food at the inn! Dramatic! Lia ogles Rafe and Kaden! Exciting! Pauline and Lia giggle! Intense! The last 130 pages definitely picks up, however. Why couldn't we have the romance and an engaging fantasy story that has...I don't know...some elements of fantasy? \n -Deliberately concealing who the assassin is and who the prince is. To me, this was more of a gimmick than an actual writing technique meant to increase tension and add some mystery. And honestly, I couldn't care less. Why? Because it doesn't matter. They're both in love with her and they're both pretty interchangeable characters so it really doesn't matter who turns out to be the assassin or the prince. This also does a disservice to the characters, who as I just mentioned are not well drawn. Part of this is because we can't get too into their feelings and motivations because that would ruin the who surprise identity. Oh no! Can't sacrifice a gimmick for actual character development!"}
{"text": "This novel is very good despite all its attempts to subvert itself. It seems Maguire forgets basic concepts of storytelling, such as cause and effect and motif, making the novel's events seem random. There's no real joy here, and sometimes the writing can be subpar (don't get me started on the dialogue). I really disliked it when I started. Then about halfway through, something changed. Things began to come together to a thrilling conclusion. \n It's easy to like prequels. You see a nod to the original, and you are all \"OMG I KNOW WHAT THAT IS!\" \"Wicked\" isn't above this, especially in the last chapter which basically covers the events from \"The Wizard of Oz.\" However, Maguire uses these nods minimally, instead crafting a dark, adult, and complicated version of the Land of Oz. Basically, this novel is a work of dystopian literature, using a familiar and fantastic setting rather than a \"not too distant future\" cliche. And it's great. It may be off-putting for some, but I was completely enraptured in his world. The supporting characters are memorable, and although it takes a while, Maguire slowly hones in on Elphaba, the titular witch. She's an outsider for most of the novel's first half, but as it progresses, we get closer and closer, and her transformation is intriguing to witness. \n It's not fully satisfying, however. We all know how it ends, and you can't help but feeling like there should have been more, that things were cut off short. It's an original prequel, a literary work of fan-fiction, a grim but good read. I just want to know what happens to this world after. \n Well, I guess that's what the sequel is for..."}

{"text": "A super quick, light read that is entertaining enough though it is burdened with some annoying paranormal romance tropes (the simpering girl and the brooding angsty man fall instantly and melodramatically in love). The period detail and supporting cast were nicely drawn and the mystery, while somewhat simple, was interesting enough to propel the narrative forward."}
{"text": "I can say with 100% certainty, the cover made me choose this book. It is stunningly gorgeous, really fits the story, and I utterly adore it. \n Aside from the cover, my thoughts on this book are really mixed. Bear with me as I try and sort out my mess of feelings on this story. \n Let's start at the beginning. This is a sequel, but have no fear if you haven't read the first one. The author gives you a long, dry, drawn out narrative of the character reminding you (or informing you) about everything that happened in the last book. This went on for over 10 pages, straight. (no, not weaved in, or seamless) I hadn't read the first book, but if I had I might have stopped right there out of boredom. \n I get it, I do. It is great when a reader can come into a series that is already in progress. I honestly admire that. But the infodropping needs to be more like infosprinkles and less like infolandmines. \n I stuck with it, and eventually we got to the actual story of the current book, and it improved. Sort of. The plot did, anyway. The writing and the tone was still sadly a bit dry. I constantly found myself rolling my eyes. The dialogue was the worst. Very, very unrealistic. It was like \"Oh Caleb, I'm so mad at you so could you go stand over there where I don't have to look at you while I sit here and pout? Thanks, I really appreciate that you are willing to give me space even while you sulk.\" - No, that isn't an actual line from the story, it is me exaggerating a bit. But it was how I felt like they were talking. The dialogue was very introspective and indulgent and not at all realistic. \n Why am I going on and on about this? Because underneath the storytelling style that bugged the heck out of me, was a good story. I actually really did like the plot, and I continued to read when while resisting the urge to give up, because I honestly wanted to know what happened. I'm rating this book low because it honestly was not for me. But if this writing style doesn't bother you and you are a plot driven reader, you could very well really like this book. \n I'm a character driven reader, and I really didn't bond with any of the characters. I didn't even particularly like any of them. I thought Julia was a selfish spoiled brat. I thought her father was a moron, and I thought both of the boys deserved better. \n The best advice I can give is wait until this is available as an ebook, download the sample, and try it for yourself. If you aren't bothered by the style, consider buying it because underneath an unrefined storytelling style, is a gem of a story with important themes like \"nothing is set in stone, make your own future, and karma is a bitch.\" \n One other thing - If you are reading this for the romance bit - I wouldn't. It really isn't a romance, even though there is a 'love triangle.'"}
{"text": "Eh...I don't know. I am not in love with the characters. I don't think I'm going to finish the series. I don't exactly care what happens to them. The best parts of this book were the brother James and the underground superhero society. I like that idea but I wish it would have been introduced earlier. I am also disappointed with the lack of women in this book. For the majority of the book, it was just Juliette and the men's obsession with her was disturbing and exagerated. Eventually we met Sara and Sonya however they were twins who spoke at the same time and left little to no exploration or depth. \n Additionally, the language was distracting. I understand the style. I can appreciate the poetry behind the language but I found it disruptive to the story. Also, I was sick of it by the time it the story approached Juliette and Adam's relationship. It was dramatic and hyperbolic. Some of the analogies and metaphors were beautifully written and viscerally visual. Yet, they did not move the plot forward or do anything to develop the characters. If anything, it made me dislike Juliette more if that was how her brain worked all the time. It's exhausting. Can't she just experience anything as it is? The stars don't need to explode every time he touches her. \n Overall, I didn't find this story to be original. It felt like Rouge's story from X-Men. I didn't understand the world or the motivations behind the characters. I hear people rant and rave about Warner but someone who starts out as so horrible has to do an unrealistic 180 to become so lovable is not someone I wish to follow. If I am going to pick up the rest of the series, it will be to see where the underground society goes. But if it heads into some sort of revolution and war against the current government with Juliette as the figure-head, I'm out."}

To save spoilers, where it fell apart for me is when the setting change. For a brief time the narration tense changed, and it was distracting and brought me out of the moment of the story. After that I just never got into it as heavily. \n I'm not sorry I read it, but I am not sure if I have enough confidence in it to pick up the last 3 books of the series even though I am curious about what else will happen. \n I thought the idea of the story itself was very original and well crafted. I will say that I definitely do not feel this is a young adult book, there are to many adult themes and references ( I would say at minimum 16+) \n I also at times felt myself distracted by the unique terminology used to create the world. There is a fine line between setting the stage, and bringing the reader out of the world you have created because they have to stop and try and recall what a term means. I think this book possibly fell onto the side of being a bit confusing at times. \n The editing was better than many of the indie published novels I have read, although there were a few non distracting easily forgivable mistakes. \n In the end, I gave it 3 stars. It was worth a read, but I wouldn't go back and reread and I definitely wouldn't gush to my friends that they have to immediately read this book."}

If you like dystopian stories that are intricate and full of twist and turns this is a fun series to discover. \n \"The good guys and bad guys aren't as easy to tell apart as I used to think they were.

{"text": "It was with a little trepidation that I began reading Wards of Faerie. It had been decades since I'd last read a Terry Brooks novel, and the Shannara series was never one I had gotten into too deeply, mostly for a lack of resources. I knew that over the years the breadth of the story had grown, and that series that didn't used to be related, like the Word and the Void, had been incorporated into the larger mythos. Still, most of my exposure came from a summer reading through the Magic Kingdom books. Could I jump in unscathed? \n The Wards of Faerie, as it turns out, is very open to the new reader. A brief run through wikipedia wouldn't hurt the new reader, but Terry Brooks is ever the consummate story teller, and with almost no effort gives us a story that is very easy to fall into. It is a world where science and magic are at ends with each other, with many of the secrets of magic lost even to the Druids, caretakers of such knowledge. Aphenglow Elessedil, an elf and a Druid, stumbles upon a lost journal that hints at the whereabouts of the famed elfstones. The Druid's quest to recover the elfstones will mean the gathering of a party and following a vision beyond the known lands as they seek out the lost elfstones. \n It's always a pleasure to read something written by a master of the craft, and this was no exception. Brooks has spent over thirty years developing this world, and the world-building shows. The world that this story is set in has a depth that we can see just beneath the surface without being dragged through it, which helps the story move along at a good pace. The characters that populate it are well developed and believable, rather than the stock two dimensional characters that seem to litter the genre so often. \n Knowing in advance that this will be yet another trilogy, though, I do have to say I was a bit disappointed with where the book ended. This isn't just the poignant disappointment of a story that ended sooner than the reader may have wanted. The bulk of the book was spent developing characters and introducing us to the world as it is, but just as the party is formed and the real action began to start up, the book came to an end. \n My rating of this book came after a lot of thinking, and ultimately was tied to the fact that the story, the meat of why we are reading, is cut too short too soon. Knowing that we are only looking at a trilogy, it seems as though too much time was spent developing characters rather than moving the plot along. Fans of the milieu will enjoy the book, knowing that it will lead somewhere in the next book. Casual readers, though, I think will be put off unless they are already committed to seeing the story develop in the next volume. \n My thanks to Netgalley and Random House for giving me the opportunity to review this work and providing an advanced reader's copy."}

It's like you have to read 300 pages to move a small inch. \n Without spoiling anything this book is the same as the others. Annoying adults, clueless girl, and a *shock* cliffhanger. \n I was NOT pleased when a major storyline was introduced to readers with only 20 pages to go. I knew where this was leading, and knew there wasn't time to flesh it out. So that means book 4 (yes you read that right) will start with 100 pages of fleshing out the plot element introduced in the last 20 pages of this book.

It is a really good story of guilt, mistakes and the people it hurts and people getting lost in all of that. This is a story that has many levels to it - you will feel like you're in one realm only to morph into another with visions and nightmares coming to life. It is a difficult mirror, one that will have you think about what you truly do believe."}
{"text": "This book was a bit depressing. A children's early reader book is not the place to try and tackle mental health issues. This book starts off light and fluffy and in the last 20 pages the mother up and leaves her 10 year old daughter with no warning, nothing. \n why does she leave her? She is bipolar. Apparently she neglected her daughter for 10 years and would leave her crying and with no food. \n Given thereally was no warning about this and the topic is just half thrown out there I felt it was horrible."}

{"text": "I have been \"reading\" this book for about a month, and I put \"reading\" in quotes because I can barely get through a few pages at a time before I get anxious and angry and toss it back down on the table. I have decided, finally, to give this one up. And here's why. \n It's not good. \n I tried--really hard--to like it. I wanted to like it. During my sporadic reading of the first one hundred awful pages, I continually flipped to the back cover to scan the great blurbs from Junot Diaz (who I think really is a talented writer!), The New Yorker, The Chicago Tribune, and more. I kept saying to myself, \"Self, you must be wrong; keep reading and you'll get to the good stuff.\" But the good stuff never came. \n Now, Grossman can write some really nice prose. He's got some lovely metaphors and interesting imagery. But he simply cannot tell a story with any immediacy or importance. The first half of the book (and the only half I'll be reading) summarized any and all conflict and left me thinking, \"okay, when is the story going to start?\" But it never does after 221 pages. It's beyond boring. A \"Beast\" comes to the school and puts the entire college in a state of suspended animation and kills a student; and it gets about three pages. I kept having to go back and re-read lines and paragraphs to make sure that it had actually happened. It ends up feeling just as important as the numerous scenes of students drinking wine, and that's an odd effect. And maybe that's Grossman's point--in adolescence, everything is boring? I don't know. But it's bad storytelling and really frustrating to read. \n And his characters are wholly, unequivocally unlikable. They're not given enough development--and I'm including the protagonist, Quentin, in this pile of dullards--so they turn out flat and meaningless. I don't get their motivation and at the end of the day, I just don't care. Am I supposed to feel this same ennui that Quentin feels about...everything? Even his magic? I don't know. If so, bravo, Grossman. You've successfully made me not care. \n And now, we come to the magic. Um, it's magic. Ma. Gic. It should be cool. There should be whole passages, pages, chapters devoted to it. It should be visceral. It should be amazing and awesome. It is none of these things. The book could have taken place at the University of Minnesota and it wouldn't have mattered. More ennui. More boredom. More summary. Although we do get shape-shifting fox sex. Yes, you read that correctly, and it's beyond creepy. Losing your virginity is awkward and weird enough; did Grossman have to make it fox sex? \n I'm confident that I'm in the minority with my opinions of this book, and I'm okay with that. Maybe I'm too old to appreciate it. Maybe I'm not smart enough or cool enough. I'm okay with that, too. And if you want to make a case for it, be my guest, I'll listen. But I will not be finishing this book. And that decision, after 30 days of waffling and trying, makes me happy."}

{"text": "This final episode of Season Two doesn't disappoint. \n I just love when a book ends well. \n Alexa and Zachariel are under the gun, not only to save themselves, but also ten thousand humans who have been randomly targeted for (lethal) debt collection by the actions of Gehenna, a shadowy confederation of debt collectors who dream of immortality. \n Time is running out, mere hours remain before the faulty files are examined and flagged, with collection beginning the next morning. Oh, and Alexa, Zachariel and Wyatt, are being held hostage by Gehenna's two most vicious collectors: Molloch and Seth. \n If only something terrific would happen, like, say, Molloch dropping dead. \n Nothing so fantastic happens, but there is a blood bath and a coup, and a whole lot of happy feels. The end is as excellent as the eight episode prelude had indicated. The result? Solid storytelling, a bit of heat, a dash of lovin' and an HEA to hang one's most comfortable smoking jacket upon. (If one had a selection of smoking jackets to hang, that is. For all non-smoking-jacket-owning readers, you're gonna love it, too!) \n I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."}
{"text": "I find it a terrible offense that King's Rising is so despicably \n deplorably \n scandalously \n hellishly \n SHORT. \n I need more; an epilogue- like a little short of what Damen and Laurent's life would be like now; reading about them navigating around the intricacies of politics together would be titillating. Okay, and maybe I'm just begging for more scraps of literature but C.S Pacat, just pleeeease? \n My final thoughts are that it was the perfect tie-up for a perfect trilogy. It was a fantastical adventure in which I was rooting for the main characters. It was climactic all the way (boy, I even got a mini heart attack after the first chapter). The writing was arresting in its descriptions of battles/warfare and ultimately superior to others. The characters were fleshed-out so thoroughly and in such a manner that I felt for them and with them every step of the journey. \n Oh, and the twists? They were so good. Absolutely unpredictable and I NEVER say that. Even without an foreshadowing, they made total sense. Jeezus, the Regent is a twat. I feel like he suffered too easily. \n P.S I received this book today. Took me less than a day to finish it. My only regret is that in finishing it, I did not wait to savor each chapter and each word. Instead, I was caught up in my eagerness to complete the trilogy. Actually, why am I blaming myself? I'm so clearly a victim of the book's fast pacing. XD \n P.P.S Prince's Gambit would have to be my all-time favourite book in this series but King's Rising came close to dethroning that spot."}
{"text": "Nobody \"Bod\" Owens is raised in a graveyard by ghosts and an inscrutable Guardian. He's hiding out from the man who killed his parents, but meanwhile is entirely content to live in a world of ghouls, Fading, Haunting, Witches, and Dreamwalking. \n What I love about Neil Gaiman's work is that it is hauntingly familiar, while still pushing the imagination to understand and realize. As in Coraline, he takes well-rubbed themes and turns them inside out. In The Graveyard Book, it's the story of a kid who grows up on the outside--literally. Bod is practically outside life itself, but with ingenuity and fortitude he makes it work for himself. \n In many ways, I see Gaiman as comparable to Tom Stoppard. Both take common knowledge and use that as a foundation for inspired storylines. But where Stoppard turns his lens towards the theater, Gaiman turns it to novels for both young and old."}

Fantastical creatures and legendary wizards, men with shifting moralities, women who have their own secret agendas, and others will have to choose a side and take a final stand in a battle that the spirits in Heaven itself are eagerly anticipating. \n In this final volume of the Tale of Shikanoko series, Hearn ties up all loose ends from numerous plot threads and resolves issue with her many, many characters and provides a satisfying ending to her creative, epic, strange, twisted fairy tale style fantasy. While I did have some hesitations with the uneven writing style (often choppy but occasionally lyrical), the daunting number of players, and the constantly shifting moral platform of the tale, Tengu's Game of Go provided a satisfying ending and Hearn's tale was a departure from my typical reading choices that I'm glad I succumbed to. \n Thank you to Farrar, Strauss and Giroux, and NetGalley for providing this ARC in exchange for an honest review."}
{"text": "Lest anyone make any mistakes, this is pop fiction, or chicklit with a brain. A huge brain, yes, which made it an enjoyable Saturday-morning curl-up-and-read book. But it's NOT Harry Potter, despite what everyone says; I will be honest and admit that neither is it Twilight, though it's much, much closer to the latter than to the former. It's fun, but it's brain candy, and the fiction writing feels amateur (the first paragraph of the book almost made me stop right there). \n Best for fans of The Physick Book of Deliverance Dane or Kate Mosse, though ultimately superior (in my opinion only!) to any of Kate Mosse's works. \n So, four stars because of its simple, beach-read-like enjoyment factor, but make no mistake about its being more than it is."}

{"text": "For the most part I really liked this book. It's unique and interesting and the detail put into describing the circus is enchanting. However, it takes a long time for things to make sense. When we finally get some answers about what the challenge is and its purpose, I found myself thinking \"that's it?\". I don't know what I was expecting but at that point I started to lose interest. The fact that Prospero and Alexander force their students into competing with no choice in the matter, and with no knowledge of what they are doing or that one of them has to die for the challenge to end really bothered me. It's selfish and risking someone's life just to determine which form of magic/manipulation is \"better\" is not worth it . I did enjoy how Celia and Marco collaborated even though they knew they were competitors. It was interesting to read about their additions to the circus and the reasons for building those additions . \n I also have an issue with Marco. I initially liked him but after the way he treats Isobel I found him unlikable and a little creepy. His love for Celia seemed more like an obsession and by the end of the book I didn't care for him."}

Together they learn truths that they never knew existed and, by the end of the book, experienced some of those truths for themselves. \n An other action packed story, immersed in a love story that made me laugh and possibly shed a tear.

{"text": "Where to begin this review? A lot of people like to highlight that Saladin's book is a nice break from Euro-centric fantasy, but to be honest, when you're reading it, that's not what you're paying attention to. What you're watching is the story and characters. Does Saladin deliver? \n Almost. \n We're presented with good characters and a classic but compelling tension. Something dark and evil is rising up, we have ghuls of all variety, a were-lion, a fighting dervish, magic, the mystery of the desert - where do we go wrong? \n For me, the problem was twofold. First, I don't think we had enough depth. The brush strokes are so broad that there's a lack of definition with some of the characters. This might just be an artifact of the fact that its the first book in the series, and Salidan plans on giving more depth later. \n My other problem with the story is that the end seemed a bit rushed. After so much time spent circling around the central mystery, the actual confrontation was a bit short and lackluster. Two sides meet and one walks away, in about as many words as this review will end up being. \n Don't get me wrong - I really enjoyed this book, and it was a fun read. My dissapointment is because I expected more from the book than it actually promised. I settled on four stars because I felt it was a 3 1/2 star book with a lot of potential to be more."}

{"text": "Ursula Vernon is one of my favorite modern children's authors. Her series, Dragonbreath, is absolutely brilliant from the well-thought out characters to the fun drawings, and not to mention the funny dialogue between the characters. When I saw Castle Hangnail was coming out, I knew I had to give it a try. \n Castle Hangnail is a bit different from Vernon's Dragonbreath series. It has interesting characters and beautiful drawings, but it strays from the all-to-familiar format of the loveable Dragonbreath series. \n One of the first noticeable differences is the format of the book. Dragonbreath isn't really an early reader/chapter book, but it is definitely designed for the younger audience. Dragonbreath comes in a half graphic novel, half novel format. The font is large and bold, and the entire book wraps up in 200 pages give or take. Castle Hangnail is a bit different. \n Castle Hangnail has illustrations, but they supplement the story instead of help tell the story. There are numerous chapters that have no illustrations at all. The font is still easy to read and the story flows nicely, making it ideal for younger readers, but not to the point where it feels as if it is a childish book. \n Unfortunately, this difference is where one of my \"issues\" - if you could call it that - comes in. I'm not 100% certain who the ultimate audience is for this novel. It is written for a younger audience, but the nearly 400 page novel might seem a bit overwhelming to those that would be its target audience. \n Is the storyline okay for older readers? Yes, but I could easily see a few of the older readers finding the story childish or silly. When I refer to 'older' readers, I'm talking about older middle grade readers. The difficulty in identifying a target audience may result in this loveable novel being overlooked or passed up by readers who would otherwise love it. \n What I do love about Castle Hangnail is that it does provide a bit of fresh air to the children's fantasy genre. There seems to be an all-to-common need to make children's books darker, scarier, or more violent. Castle Hangnail has its conflicts as it isn't all rainbows and butterflies, but it does so in a way that isn't violent or ultra-extreme. \n This stray from violence or darkness makes it a great book for those readers both young and old who are just looking for a fun read. After all, it has a solid plot that works for even those that are young at heart, the characters are detailed and loveable, and the pace is just right. \n I will say I loved the characters in this book. They weren't funny, but they pulled at my heart strings and I just formed instant connections with them. I truly wanted to be Molly's friend by the end of the book. I even wanted to have my own set of minions - even a goldfish! Vernon really fleshed out all the characters without overcomplicating them, which made them even more loveable (or unlovable in the case of the bad guys). \n If I had to pick a favorite part of the book, it would definitely be the mish-mash collection of characters. They just worked for me and really made this book a fun, fun read. \n Overall, I loved Castle Hangnail. I felt it was a solid novel with a solid ending. Of course, there could be other novels, which I would love to see, but for the most part it is a solid standalone novel. It isn't the same as Dragonbreath, but it certainly will leave you with a feel good feeling at the end of reading it."}

This book was 2/3rds about servent life in the turn of the century with a very tiny part spent on the actual mermaid part. As a fan of mermaids I would have loved to see more then 5 pages dedicated to it, but alas it wouldn't be a series if we jumped to the good parts. \n There's romance, drama, and a couple of boring interactions or details that could have been left out but over all it's a good book \n I will pick up the series later but I really hope that as the series mentions 3 sisters, that the second book doesn't focus on some other aspect of life and only have a tiny part of the mermaid in it. \n Also this book left off just when it got good, which was disappointing. 300 pages and I still don't know what happens. I felt incomplete and that's not always good. \n Great story for preteens maybe even teens, and I can see some adults getting into it :)"}
{"text": "This second book of the Finishing School series picks up several months after the first, with (now 15 y/o) Sophronia Temminnick back at school following the thwarting of several groups' attempts at obtaining the \"prototype\". What we learn is this prototype is a guidance valve, for use in transmission across the aetherosphere. And, it had been created by the parents of Sophronia's dearest friends, Dimity and Pillover. \n This tale brings Mlle. Geraldine's floating Finishing School into London--along with the company of ten male students from Bunsen's School of Evil Geniuses, among them Pillover and Lord Felix Mersey who is quite taken with Sophronia. \n Attempts to kidnap Dimity are dashed by Sophronia's quick thinking and incomplete training, but Sophronia knows she must learn whom is behind the attempts, in order to keep her dear friend safe. Also, the cause of their mission--observation of a transchannel trip through the aetherosphere---seems to be far outside the realm of normal intelligencer behavior. It seems there is a covert test planned, one that may cause great harm to Sophronia's favorite vampire professor. \n In unraveling the conspiracy, Sophronia must keep her wits and seek alliances with old friends and new acquaintance--even dandy vampires riding about the London scene. Sophronia's uncanny ability to spy, scheme and escape are put to the test when Dimity and Pillover are finally napped. But, can she apply her training to remover herself from the sticky business of finding herself caught between two suitors--especially those who do not suit? In the end, Sophronia discredits one teacher, nearly gets another murdered, and learns to accept that sometimes her schemes will force her to employ--gasp!--a dandy gentleman's attire. \n Oh, and it seems Sophronia's being courted. By more than one powerful man. With all the mayhem and gore, this book's heavy on the espionage and light on the romance, though the book seems decidedly more YA than the first one in the series (which I would suggest is Tween). The pace is blistering and the language is humorous and fascinating. I love the period speech, and the nuances of manners, how they are used to advantage by these intelligencing women. Lord Mersey will be a problem, no doubt, going forward, but so will Sophronia's \"friendship\" with Soap, the black sootie. Looking forward to the next adventure. \n I received a copy of this book from NetGalley."}

The pace was just right, the writing was easy and really got me hooked. \n But beside the story, that was awesome, what I liked the most was that it made me question what I think a heroine and a villain are, if it really all depends of your point of view. \n I didn't really knew I was reading from a villain pov until the end of the book. And I still feel Adelina isn't really a villain. But maybe every villain is just someone that has suffered too much. \n Anyway, I loved Adelina. I loved that even after having a horrible childhood, she still loved her sister. Her father favored Violetta, and lets face it, Violeta did betray her a couple of times, even if she meant well. . What I didn't liked were her decisions. But I guess that when you are raised the way she was, you don't trust people much. \n About her powers She has a dark side, that was nurtured by her father, and it seems to feed her powers. I don't know if that is the only way for her to become strong. Is she inevitably going to be a villain? It makes you wonder, are her powers a sign that she was born with darkness, or did she acquire that type of powers because of the childhood she had? \n I loved Enzo, but I didn't liked Raffaelle. I felt he was an hypocrite, he and the rest of the young elites. But I loved that about the book, the fact that the good guys were willing to do whatever it takes, even killing innocents, to get Enzo in the throne. It goes to show you that even the \"good guys\" have a dark side, even if they are fighting for the greater good. \n I can't wait to see how the story continues!"}
{"text": "For this review and more go to livereadbreathe.blogspot.ca \n So. I do like this series but my major beef is the same I found in the first book because it is in a multiple POV story it can get very confusing on whose POV it is and sometime you have to re-read to realize who it is. I wish it was better stated which would create a better flow. \n But really that is my only real issue. The story and suspense is good and Kelli keeps you hanging on and waiting for more. I can't wait to find out how the story continues in the third book. \n In this book you are left with a few questions or I guess you could say dangling carrots of what is in store to come.I am so curious to find out what Dylan's dad and Heaven's sister are up to. \n Dylan and Heaven's relationship is enticing and strong. The chemistry is steamy and their soul bond is beautiful. \n In this story you find out way more history and the truth about how soul mates are meant to be. I truly do love the story of Dylan and Heaven."}
{"text": "I started reading House of Night back in 2009, when I was 17. Never thought I'd still be reading this series seven years later. What a journey. I'll forever cherish theses books because they've been with me for so long. On the other hand, though, they enfuriate me sometimes. Why twelve effing books when you could only do seven (the magic number)? I can't remember what happened in most of them, not because I read them a long time ago but because they were fillers. And not bearable ones. One or two times I considered giving up on this series. But I couldn't. Even though the characters annoyed the hell out of me most of the time and the story kept repeating itself over and over again. I finished them, it's done. I'm saying goodbye to Zoey and her circle and Aphrodite, my forever favourite. But I don't think I'm going to miss them all that much. It's quite sad."}

{"text": "See full review for Solider at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n So, let's be real, I love Julie Kagawa's books. She creates these worlds that are just so awesome and magical that I just wished that I lived there instead of in this one. But, since these worlds are all fiction, that is not to be. However, every time a new book in the Talon Saga comes out I'm transported to a really cool world of dragons and conspiracy. And unfortunately, love triangles, but I'll get into that little misfit later. Usually when it comes to books in multiple POVs I'm not the biggest fan. I like books to stick to two characters points of view max, when more than that get added to the mix I get supremely confused. However, in this book I liked seeing what was happening from all sides. You got to see Ember's inner thoughts and emotions. You got to see Riley and Dante's side. And then, my favorite, Garret and his younger years Sebastian. I felt like I knew what was happening at all times and it made for some delicious reading."}

{"text": "I decided that I needed to read this book after hearing it praised in several reviews of other young adult fantasy books that I had totally enjoyed. The reviewers were right. Shadow and Bone is amazing. I raced through it in about 24 hours and can't wait to read the sequels. Our story opens with two young orphans who are being brought up in a Duke's home that shelters children left alone by the war that has been ravishing their country for years. Alina and Mal grow up together and are both drafted into the army. Mal develops his innate talent as a tracker. Alina struggles to become a cartographer. But everything changes when they are sent into the Fold - a dark, desolate and cursed part of their country occupied by monsters. When one of these creatures attacks Mal, Alina turns on it in fury and her hidden talent is revealed. This immediately brings her to the attention of the Darkling. He is the leader of the Grisha, soldiers of the Second Army. They are divided into three orders: the Corporalki (Order of the Living and the Dead), the Etherealki (Order of Summoners) and the Materialki (Order of Fabrikators). Alina discovers that she is an member of the Etherealki, but one with a unique ability. She is taken to the capitol to belatedly start training to control her magical power. As she learns more about the Darkling and his evil ambitions to control the world, her life and the lives of those she loves are endangered. This book will take you by the throat and not let go until the last page. I was surprised to read that this was the first novel written by Leigh Bardugo. Fortunately it is not the last and I am a new fan who will be eagerly reading everything she writes."}

{"text": "Man, the book covers are really not getting any better. \n But that's not the point here. It's not very nice to judge a book by its cover. Unfortunately, I don't mean to imply that The Ruby Circle is a diamond in the rough; that its cover may say cheap and low-budget but its contents are wonderful and high quality; or that the characters I love keep increasing their awesomeness. \n In fact, the cover may be the highlight of my whole reading experience. \n I have stuck with this series and I have grown to love the characters (Eddie, Sydney, Adrian, Jill (well, not her so much) and I have suffered with them when they suffered. I loved the first five books so it would make sense that the sixth - the final - would tie the story off with a nice little bow. Albeit, it was a nice cute little bow. There were sappy moments all over between Adrian and Sydney which would ordinarily make me awwww but they all felt forced to me. Nothing about their relationship felt natural which was weird because for me Sydney and Adrian had great chemistry in the first four books. I shipped them from the start. So disappointing to find that all that chemistry fizzled out in the end. Who says married life has to be boring, guys! \n The plot wasn't that great. No, wait. Let me rephrase. It was alright*. It just was so forgettable. I couldn't pick out key moments that I loved like I did the previous ones and maybe it's unfair of me to keep comparing this book to others. \n But I can't help it. This was one of my favourite series by one of my favourite authors and I'm sorely disappointed with how unsatisfying The Ruby Circle was. Well, I guess Richelle Mead can't strike gold all the time. \n 2.5 stars"}

I know that there were a few loose ends to deal with, but even those ends weren't tied up in this book. I was missing something in this continuation--perhaps drive? I found myself skimming chapters just to get to the end. I guess I felt like this adventure fell flat for me."}

It reminded me too much of the \"A Discovery of Witches\" books. I've got the others in the series so I'll read them too. It wasn't bad, the writing was good, it just didn't engage me and just seemed to similar to other books of the same genre I've read."}
{"text": "Another rip roaring tale of adventure from Brian Jacques and the denizens of Mossflower Country, is the heart of this book. Tiria, a young otter maid, is destined to become the Queen High Rhulian of the Green Isle. This requires her to free the Green Isle from the horrible cats that had invaded and placed many of the otters into slavery. She leave her home at Redwall Abbey with Pandion the hawk and a rather odd acting veteran of the Long Patrol to go to Green Isle. A stop is made at the mountain home of the badgers and hares where she is given armor fit for a warrior queen and also the help of 30 veterans of the Long Patrol. Off they go for this adventure that provide moments of victory and also some sadness with the demise of fellow warriors and friend. \n As usual, there is much eating of really delicious sounding food, and the Dibbuns(what is a Dibbuns-read a Redwall Book) with their mischief and fun. All the various dialects that the author adds to the book is astounding. You do not have to be a child to enjoy these books--just a child at heart and I hope that I never lose the ability to be that!"}
{"text": "This book picks up just a few days after the end of the first book (Ruby Red) in the trilogy. Gwen has just discovered that she possesses the time traveling gene of her family and her adventure began. In Sapphire Blue she and her traveling partner Gideon travel back to the 18th century. There they meet with the leader of the Guardians (who control the time traveling) the evil Count Saint Germain. Added to this is the fact that Gwen can see ghosts and demons that others fail to see---so her conversations often become quite interesting. What is the plan for her and Gideon and will their new found romance bloom? These questions will not be answered until the last book-Emerald Green-due in October. \n This is a fascinating time travel YA book. Easy to read and even easier to get 'caught up' in the fantasy. It will be difficult to wait to see the end of the story."}

{"text": "Bear with me, because I don't read a lot of Sci-Fi. I do read a lot of M/M however, and this story qualifies.... \n An infant, Zeus, is found in hypersleep on a derelict vessel in space near the home planet of the Mar'Sani, a reptilian-humanoid species. The Empress, in grief over the loss of her youngest child, immediately adopts Zeus believing his arrival was ordained by Poseidon. Zeus is not only blind, he's a Terran (human) and Terrans are the scourge of the galaxy due to their rapacious enslavement of other planets. A war had been fought and a treaty established, but Zeus is still subject to prejudice, even as a son to the Mar'Sani imperial family. \n Zeus grows up. He is loved and cherished by his family. An attack prompts his father to employ the galaxy's preeminent geneticists, the Chtichlians, to restore Zeus's eyesight. While sedated Zeus learns that he's not quite Terran--he's a hermaphrodite--a physical condition the Chtichlians soon remedy by removing Zeus' hidden uterus. \n In time, Zeus grows into a powerful warrior, like his older foster brothers, but Zeus is denied entry into the Mar'Sani warrior training so he goes to university. He becomes the chief starship mechanic on a prime star base. While there he encounters Dargon and Alpha. This symbiotic male is comprised of a Dar Massaga and his paired symbiotic Alpha who resides as a partial covering on his body. They are connected via a mind link and sexually active within their combined unit. Dargon feels no interest for other mates, but meeting Zeus turns on his Marking instinct. This sucks because Dargon holds a deep hatred for Terrans. And that's what he believes Zeus to be. \n Dargon is in the space port for repairs, all while hiding his live cargo. At first Zeus thinks he's a pirate, but it turns out to be more complicated. Dargon is charged with finding the final Galactic prince, the Bespoken, a Fal'Amoric, or ancient race from whom all species of life were generated. The Fal'Amoric had been herded and hunted by the Terrans in the hope of gaining control of the Galactic counsel. Dargon's cargo is the last Fal'Amoric princess, and Zeus' sister. Oh, and Zeus, too, because Dargon kidnaps him so he can repair the ship while Dargon escapes pursuit from the Terrans and their V'Saar allies. \n Zeus doesn't want to be Fal'Amoric, he's Mar'Sani by choice, and he certainly doesn't want to be the Bespoken, because then he will have to be united with the two other (hermaphoroditic) Galactic princes--especially not when his baby is being carried by another. Zeus's only chance is to find his lost brother, Prometheus, in order to fulfill that Galactic destiny, and it seems his memories of his sexual mutilation by the Chtichlians holds the key. \n Holy cow. I was a bit stunned by the pace. So many species, of which I had no grasp, and yet, I adored Zeus. He overcame so much prejudice. And his destiny is truly great. He has a lot of power within himself, and is only just learning to use it. His strength has won him many admirers in the Mar'Sani nobility, even if he's persecuted by some for his 'Terran' appearance. He's also won over Dargon and Alpha--completely. They have imprinted on him, so they need to remain near each other--even if Zeus must couple with the Galactic princes. Does this make Zeus the center of a love square, or a love pentagon? \n I liked the slower build of \"pairing\" between Zeus and Dargon and Alpha. They recognize their passion, but want to start slow--not that they hold off on all physical contact. I guess they recognize the inherent problems with the possibility that Zeus will be claimed as the Bespoken. It's an interesting book. I had feared I'd get bogged in detailed explanations of sci-fi whozits and whatzits, but that didn't happen. The disjointed timeline was sometimes a gripe, but the pace was adequate. I'm interested enough to seek out the sequel. \n I received a copy of this book via NetGalley in exchange for my honest review."}

{"text": "I could say that I'm probably in a \"love-hate\" sort of relationship with this book, for I'm not really sure how I feel about it. \n The prologue was intriguing and mysterious. And, I was really excited to find out the real story. And the more I read, the more I got desperate for the truth to unravel. \n The narrator, Mara, has this weird vibe on her (not just because she's really weird, but more weirdness.) I can't even comprehend it properly, but she gives me odd feelings. For quite some times, I felt really bad for her - for whatever she's going through - and ..just.. she makes me feel lost and weird all over. I even believed for some moments that maybe she really is going mad. \n As to the Romance, hmm. I did not quite feel anything towards Mara and Noah. They don't have that much chemistry to me. While reading scenes about them , I'm just like, really reading them. It's like, I'm not drawn to their moments or such. They're just like normal characters, doing their thing. \n What I don't like about this book, is when I read something interesting, I would be waiting for more, but then I'd pass 50 pages with nothing. It's like being at the top of a mountain for a few seconds then falling for 20 minutes. \n Also, I just dislike the fact that my questions were left unanswered at the end. I didn't get what I was looking for - the answer, as to why Mara is the way she is. But I guess, that's what the next book is. \n But there's also a handful of things why I like this book. First, is that I really like Mara's brother, Daniel. Second, it made me think a lot. It intrigues me and gives me chills. I also loved all those book-geek references. Haha. \n I was expecting the Noah-having-also-some-ability thing but the Jude thing was what floored me. I did not see that one coming. HOLY GUACAMOLE. That was one heck of a cliffhanger. \n I'm so reading the next book, because HOW CAN YOU NOT with that ending?"}
{"text": "Another great book in the Throne of Glass-series. This time I actually ordered the hardcover book (instead of reading it on my iPad) and o my... so gorgeous (and large!). Definitely going to collect the entire series for my bookshelf. I will admit right away though, I didn't find this book as good as the first one. At certain points I had to force myself to read again and at other points I couldn't put the book down and would be loudly cheering for kick-ass Celaena. \n Celaena is spending her days as the Champion of the King. She gets her orders and spends the money she earns. Nothing really exciting seems to be happening. But in the back of her mind she still knows more is going on, because of Elena and Nehemia. And when she is appointed to assassinate one of her old friends, she finds out about a rebel plot. \n \"Roland studied Celaena further, a tad too intently. \"Perhaps you and I shall get to work with each other, Lillian. Your position intrigues me.\" She wouldn't mind working with him--but not in the way Roland meant. Her way would include a dagger, a shovel, and an unmarked grave.\" \n The love triangle is in the background in this book. Prince Dorian is still there, but definitely not a love interest anymore. Chaol on the other hand becomes more interesting every second. At first I thought Roland, a new character introduced quite early in the book, would become a love interest as well, but thank god that didn't happen (not every man a woman meets needs to be a love interest). \n \"An icy, endless rage swept through her, wiping away everything except the plan that she could see with brutal clarity. The killing calm, Arobynn Hamel had once called it. Even he had never realized just how calm she could get when she went over the edge. If they wanted Adarlan's Assassin, they'd get her. And Wyrd help them when she arrived.\" \n The story couldn't really grab me as the first one did. I went trough this book rather slow. Still, Calaena remains to be one kick-ass assassin. This book definitely has several awesome action scenes. Also, the ending made me want to pick up Heir of Fire right away. But I'm saving it for later ;) \n \"She tipped her head back and gave the moon a wicked smile. She'd been called Adarlan's Assassin for a reason. Dramatic entrances were practically her art form.\""}

{"text": "DAMMIT DAMMIT DAMMIT WHY did no one remind me not to read this book until the third one comes out? Actually (and this is high praise), this is a middle-of-a-trilogy that has decent closure and not a steep cliffhanger. AND I still want to read the last one. Like, tomorrow."}
{"text": "Nice book to read while on a plane: easy to follow, stories are not connected and pretty short. \n However, being a fan of the original Miss Peregrine books I can't say this impressed me. Most of the stories have a darker tone and are reminiscent of original fairy tales which were not the happy Disney version we know today. Peculiar folklore is pretty twisted. \n What I would've really liked is stories of the different loops and the peculiars living there. \n Ok for a short read with medium expectations."}
{"text": "Magnus has been homeless, living in the streets since his mother died two years ago. It's been he and his mother alone ever since she had a fight with Magnus uncles, and before she died she told him to avoid his uncle Randolph at all costs. But when his uncles and his cousin Annabeth start to look for him saying that he is in danger, he gets himself involved in a fight with a fire giant called Surt and dies as a hero. But when he wakes up, he learns that he has been chosen to stay at Valhalla by a Valkyrie named Sam, that his father is the norse god Frey and that he needs to protect his father's sword from getting into Surt's hands and starting Ragnarok, aka the end of the world. \n I really enjoy this story. I didn't know much about norse mythology and it was fun to learn, but a bit confusing. It was A LOT like Percy Jackson, but it was still fun. Magnus is a lot like Percy, a fun and reckless hero that doesn't know anything about his fathers and his heritage. I liked all the modern references and the gods personalities. Is a great adventure book to read for kids."}
{"text": "Charming humorous and entertaining! Once I actually got to sit down and read this, it was a delight."}
{"text": "SO MANY MIXED FEELINGS \n This book in two words: \n I'm not really sure how I feel about this book. What I do know is that there were parts I loved and parts I didn't. But mostly, I loved it. Weirdly enough, I'm in the minority here. I'm never the one that enjoys a book that everyone else hated/didn't like. It's usually the other way around. \n In the middle of a blizzard, Zoe lets her little brother go outside and play with the dogs because he was annoying. Not really a good start to the book. Surprise surprise, her little brother Jonah disappears outside in the snow. Zoe begrudgingly throws on her boots and coat to go look for him. She eventually finds him far away from the house and face down in the snow. She carries him to their recently deceased neighbor's house which is closer than their own house and goes inside. \n Jonah is okay, just really really cold. Their momentary peace is interrupted by Stan, an evil stark raving lunatic that neither of them knows. He has a specific reason for being at the couple's house and refuses to leave before it's done. Stan turns his attention on Zoe and her brother and things go from bad to worse. Just before Stan is about to carry out his evil misdeeds, a man shows up and stops him. An otherworldly impossibly strong man who is clearly not normal. He is X, a bounty hunter from a place called The Lowlands, a weird version of hell, and he's there to collect Stan's soul. X is immediately drawn to Zoe and breaks every rule from the Lowlands including telling her his story. X was born in hell and is forced to collect souls (bad ones of course). Zoe opens up to X about her father's recent death and as X stays with Zoe's family for a few days, they fall in love. X knows he cannot stay long, the fact that he's revealed himself to Zoe and her family puts them in danger and X has to return to hell. Determined to be together, X tries to find a way to be with her. \n Zoe rubbed me the wrong way. There really wasn't much to like. You know when you see a movie that is really good but only one of the actors are actually doing a good job and they end up carrying the entire movie? X is that good actor. Zoe, not so much. I think without X's awesomeness, I would have hated this book. She was very difficult to like. She was so detached from anyone other than X that she came off as a cold and selfish. She didn't really treat anyone well. Not her mother, her brother, or her friends. I don't know if it was intentional. Was she supposed to be that way because of her father's death? Did she close herself off from those close to her on purpose? Maybe. I highly doubt it though. She was just selfish. \n X was just awesome. He gets two stars just for being X. Every time the book was in his POV I just wanted to reach through and give him a hug. He was so damaged and so sweet. And justifiably so. He was so thankful for kindness and the complete opposite of Zoe. He would have done anything for her or family. He did do everything for them. She did not deserve him. No one does! Despite his opinions on his own self-worth, he deserved everything and more. \n The way that X collects his souls is just fascinating. I mean, for one, it's murder. I don't mean that murder is cool or fascinating, just that I loved that the process isn't pretty or romanticized, it's just straight up murder, then soul reaping. I wondered throughout how the souls the bounty hunters are ordered to collect are chosen, but I decided that it must evils souls that are going without punishment. It isn't like the supernatural bounty hunters are popping into prisons and taking people. It seems to be the evil people walking among everyone else continuing to hurt people. During their soul-reaping, the evil folks are forced to watch all of their sins via a supernatural projection onto X's back. There are a lot of flashing colors and honestly, it was bizarre in the best way. I was not a fan of the fact that Zoe takes a picture of the entire ordeal with Stan and posts a picture on Instagram. Girl, what the hell are you thinking? If I were watching a supernatural soul-reaping/murder happening the last thing on my mind would be social media. It was a stupid move on her part and really just added to the many reasons I didn't like Zoe. \n There is one of the most instant insta-loves I've ever read but it didn't really bother me. Maybe because it was supernatural. Supernatural insta love is a lot easier to explain. Because this was PG YA, it couldn't be blamed on lust. Neither is thinking that they want to jump each other bones, but they love who each other are. It bordered on the absurd, but hey, love at first sight and all that. Also, X isn't a complete douche to her before falling in love with her. Most of the male characters in insta-love are. The first example that comes to mind is Twilight. Edward was such a massive asshat to Bella before they decided they were meant for each other. X comes off as stand-offish but it's because he has no experience being around people. He may be socially inept but wants desperately to learn. \n Now, my biggest issue. That ending. Are you kidding me? Are you freaking kidding me? It made no sense. None. I realize that the author needed to set things up for a second book but that isn't an excuse. There were a million ways it could have gone and it just all went hell (haha I'm punny). I was left with a weird combination of anger and confusion. An emotion I shall now refer to as Angfusion. \n But you know what? I'll still read the next book when it comes out. I'm so invested in this I just have to know what happens next. I need to know what happens next. WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT?"}

{"text": "I wanted to love this book from the start. Call me shallow (!) but I liked the cover straight away and it sounded quirky, just up my street. \n It is some time since I read this but I still remember vividly thinking it was far too long.

I found it dragged interminably in places and then it was a page turning ending so by the end I had mixed feelings. \n Definitely not one I would read again but still, quite enjoyed it once I'd finished!"}
{"text": "4.5 reasons to come."}
{"text": "Firstly, I'd like to thank Brandon Sanderson for taking on this project a few years back. Starting these books when I was about to finish HS, allowed me to grow up with them in more ways then one. The end was very fitting for the novels, and I was very happy to see Mat in most of the action. There was a lot of bouncing around to a lot of different scenes and battlegrounds, but I thought it worked well, and kept the pacing going. I still think Perrin is kinda whiny, but that's ok. It feels weird to be finished with a story that has encompassed the last 13 years. \n I didn't feel like any major loose ends were left dangling in a way that was poor. Obviously, there's always going to be the scenario of What happens next? But I don't really need to know. The story has closed, the books are all done, and the winds that started the books finally get to putter out. \n RIP RJ, your Epic has finally come to a close."}

The reader follows Daine as her ability to talk to animals grows and as her adventures continue. \n In Wolf-Speaker, Daine, now fourteen years old, is summoned by Brokerfang, the leader of the wolf pack she associated with after her family was killed. She rides to answer the summons along with her pony Cloud, dragon Kitten and the mage Numair. The pack tells her that the humans, in Dunlath, are cutting off all the trees, chasing away all the game and doing extensive mining, which is disturbing the wolf pack that has had to relocate. \n When they arrive at Dunlath, Daine and Numair realise that something is amiss. Numair meets an old-school friend/enemy, named Tristan as well as three other mages. \n Daine's character continues to grow and she learns several valuable lessons in Wolf-Speaker, which show great character development. The story has lots of rising tension but not the type of rising tension that shatters your brain. There is also some sarcasm and light humour here and there to break the tension even for a few seconds. \n Wolf-Speaker introduces the reader to many new creatures from Tamora Pierce's vivid imagination, such as 'Hurroks', 'a slurring of horse-hawk', a wholly different take on the Basilisk and others. \n This second installment in Tamora Pierce's The Immortals Quartet is as exciting as the first. Also, the character descriptions at the beginning allow the reader to read each installment without having to refer to or read the previous parts."}
{"text": "What do you get when you take hoodies, angels, unicorns, and humans and combine it with gumdrops, lollipops and candy? Well, you get the world that was created for Death's Academy by Michael Bast. \n I came across Death's Academy by accident while browsing my library's website. The synopsis appeared to be a combination of a Harry Potter meets Percy Jackson concept mixed with the humor that is found in Diary of a Wimpy Kid. So, I figured I'd give it a shot and I am glad I took a chance, as this novel is one of the best middle school novels I've read in a while. \n What makes Death's Academy so good? It is the voice that Michael Bast brings to the novel. He has a way of telling the story in a fun, humorous style that doesn't seem to get old. There are running jokes throughout the book, but Bast knows how to toe the line between keeping the jokes alive and making sure they don't get old. \n Bast knows how to bring humor to the story. There were several parts that I found funny, and most certainly if I were a child in middle school there would have been other parts that were just as hilarious. Death's Academy certainly has enough to keep the average adult reader entertained, but it is a book that is targeted to middle school, so there are plenty of fart references and other middle school humor elements thrown in. \n In addition to the smooth, humorous voice, Death's Academy is unique, funny and a little bit 'out there'. Taking a look at all the elements of the book separately - guardian angels, grim reapers, unicorns, candy villages, and humans - it would seem like someone just took whatever thought came into their head and threw it down on paper. Even if this is what Bast did, he did it successfully. \n Everything in Death's Academy seems to connect to each other and make the plot flow. There is just enough backstory provided that readers aren't lost, but readers aren't bogged down with lengthy explanations. The backstory that is provided is enough to make the characters stand on their own, but allows the readers to grow and learn with the characters. \n What is nice about Death's Academy is the readers aren't rooting for the typical 'good' guy. Night, the main character, is ultimately a bad guy, but he isn't. He looks out for his friends, has difficulty killing things, and really wants to do what is best for everyone. Sure, he's a little mouthy and strong willed, but he works for the story and is relatable to almost everyone who reads this book. \n If you are looking for detailed, in-depth plot elements, you probably aren't going to find it with Death's Academy. There is enough to keep the story going, but adult readers will certain find holes in the story - and if you are looking to nitpick, I'm sure there is something there to find. \n While I enjoyed Death's Academy, there is something that I would - if I had the power - change. I believe the title of the book is a bit misleading. It is more of a prequel to Death's Academy. The main character - Night - spends his time worrying about getting into the academy and really doesn't spend one moment at the academy. \n The lack of Death's Academy doesn't take away from the novel, and once other novels are added to what one can assume will be a series it will make sense. However, it is a good setup to what will be a very promising series. \n Overall, Death's Academy was a major surprise for me. I loved the main character and found him believable. In fact, I was rooting for him and felt a little bad for him at times. I really think Death's Academy is a great read for almost everyone. It is a great 'read aloud' book for families, while older more independent readers will find it a fun read. Adults will certainly appreciate the humor and creativity that is obvious with this novel. \n I look forward to reading more from Michael Bast and hope the Death's Academy series will continue. I know I'll be waiting for more."}
{"text": "Fate Undone can certainly be read as a stand alone. I do recommend that readers take the time to read the series, as readers will gain a better understanding of the Mythean Arcana world created by Linsey Hall. Linsey has a way of creating characters that are strong and perseverant, despite the odds against them. \n Yay for Logan (Loki), he gets his own story, which is hinted to in Stolen Fate. As the story begins, Logan falls in love with a demigoddess, Sylvi. Leaving Sylvi was the hardest thing Logan ever did, despite his actions his love never waivered. In an tempt to get her back the reader is taken through time, leaps dimensional planes, all to once again claim Sylvi's heart, that is if Logan can complete his quest. Otherwise it will cost him and Sylvi their minds... \n Great continuation to the series, I am looking forward to the next book! I recieved a copy via Netgalley. 4.5/5 stars"}
{"text": "Thought the beginning and ending were very interesting. It got a little slow in the middle with all the cave info: \"tunnel this, tunnel that\". I would definitely reread it again someday.

{"text": "I don't read a lot of paranormal/shifter romances but felt like a change so picked The Atherton Pack series. My choice was also impacted by my interest in the Australian setting. \n I enjoyed the story which was about Declan running from trouble after witnessing a murder. Declan is running for his life but also fearful as he has left his younger brother behind and is afraid of repercussions. \n As fate would have it, Declan turns up on the doorstep of his mate. He is destined to be with Liam, beta in another pack. \n Interestingly, I didn't pay much attention to the Australian setting. Apart from recognising names such as Cairns and the Atherton tablelands, and thinking that wolves didn't fit into that environment (which the author acknowledged at one point), the setting was largely irrelevant to the story. \n The story is slightly predictable but enjoyable, the characters are great and this book provides a nice lead in to the next book....."}

{"text": "I'm not sure what to say about this book, so I'll divide it into two chunks: \n The Good: It's well-written and moves quickly. There's no moment when the reader feels bogged down. Transitioning between a past story and a present story is difficult and although the first time it happened was a little jolting, I adapted to it fast. In many ways, both stories -- about the modern girl and her troubles and the \"wyrder\" and her sister -- are equally engaging. The dialogue is never stiff and it doesn't have too much description (but enough). \n The Bad: It's not very deep and a lot of the initial responses to members of the opposite sex are simply lust. Lilian wants Cade the first time she sees him, and that never subsides. We find out later the reason why she's such a sex-charged character but even that doesn't really compute, since lust drives ALL the characters. At one point, the king of the faes transports the wyrder into fae country... to seduce her. Why? She references her plainness several times, so why would this fae king want her so desperately? Fortunately, the sexual aspect is never all that graphic (talk of burning loins and such) but still, it's uncomfortable and makes the story more torrid than it needs to be. \n Overall, I'll read it again -- but for such a good writer, it needed more than sexually charged emotions behind it."}
{"text": "While I enjoyed this story and flew through it, there were so many things that were wrong with it that took so much away from the story. This story is supposed to be based on Russia, or at least had elements from it, but the only thing Russian about it were the names of characters. I had such high hopes of exploring a new land and culture and the novel really disappointed me in that aspect. The world just was not fleshed out enough. \n Also, the main character was so obsessed with looks, it got on my nerves often. Plus, she found out she had this great gift that could save many lives, she plucked out of poverty and placed in such a luxurious world, so much was given to her but all she did was complain about things. She would make a lot of mistakes and then spend a lot of time angsting about them. She wasn't a bad character, just very frustrating at times. \n A lot of these issues had already been raised in other reviews but anyway, I did enjoy this story. It just left a lot to be desired. Or maybe I had high hopes. But I will be continuing on with the series because I'm really curious to see where it goes from here."}
{"text": "I really loved this book and got into it. Partly because I am a huge England fan (sometimes I think I was born there). I loved the way that Chadbourn mixed Arthurian myths with modern day, it's a hard mix to pull off but he did is successfully and it didn't really feel forced. \n For a first book in a series I felt that the book left off in just the right spot so that you want to read the second but feel good about the first. \n The only problem I saw with this book, is if you aren't familiar with British terms and roads it may be a tiny bit confusing. \n On a personal note: I didn't really care for the character Laura, I felt she was too sarcastic all the time. That changed at the end but that was a little quirk about the book."}
{"text": "Cinder was a fun teen fic novel that takes the classic story of Cinderella as purely an inspiration for it's plot. Meyer puts a whole new spin by creating this futuristic world filled with cyborgs and humans living together. While yes Linh Cinder has an evil stepmother, only one of her stepsisters is evil. And while yes there is a ball Cinder ends up attending, she only goes to warn the prince of an plot made by the evil queen of the planet Lunar. Cinder is also more than she seems: she might be the key to saving the planet from a deadly disease. \n What I like about this book was how original it is. Meyer puts a lot of detail in this fictional earth world and as the story unfolds, all the pieces come together quite nicely. I also liked that the romance between Cinder and her prince was very secondary, in fact one might argue it was barely there. This story was more about Cinder realizing her importance and what she'll have to do to keep herself alive. As noted, this is only the first book in the series so the ending is unresolved. I'm ready for more!"}

Though the story had some truly disturbing instances you never felt overwhelmed with horror, Otsuichi has a gift for gently exhibiting the grotesque."}

{"text": "Of Sea and Stone by Kate Avery Ellison is the launch pad and first instalment in the Secrets of Itlantis series. Told in the first person from Aemi's perspective, the novel opens in the Village of the Rocks. However, it soon moves to the Cities of Itlantis, built beneath the water, after our heroine is kidnapped along with others from her village. \n Aemi is a 'thrall', a fancy word for slave, so was her mother. However, Aemi has been collecting as much money as she could in order to buy her freedom and go to a place her mother told her tales about; a place called Perilous. Kidnapped, Aemi goes to Itlantis, where she becomes an Indentured, a person serving a sentence in order to pay debt. This is a means to hide both her identity and Nol's, the only person left with her from her village and a person she constantly dislikes. \n Of Sea and Stone is quick-paced, although the final five or six chapters move at torpedo-speed. \n Aemi's character is an interesting one; she is quick, intelligent, capable of plotting and overall likeable. However, she is often paranoid, which is both useful as it makes her observant but often annoying. Once in Itlantis, she constantly tries to find a means to escape and go back to the surface. However, as time passes and she gets closer to the family she serves, she feels a pang whenever she thinks of her escape plans and that she would never see Lyssia, her mistress and friend, again. \n \"Nevertheless, something lingered in my chest, heavy like sadness. Leaving this house would require its own kind of grieving, one that made little sense to me but that was undeniable. A captive caring for her captors.\" \n We see Aemi's character develop from hard-headed to kind and loving, especially as she becomes acquainted with new feelings and terms like 'friends'. Since the novel is narrated from her perspective, her emotions are very clear and beautifully written. \n At one point she says: \"I was a pit of shadows, an ocean of unshed tears.\" \n Nol, too, is an interesting character. The novel opens with him as the mayor's second son, who is smug, haughty and obnoxious. But as events progress and he is thrust in Itlantis, he realises many things and captivity changes him. His character gradually changes, showing signs of clear and quick thinking, a good understanding of politics and a caring heart. \n Of Sea and Stone is rich with likeable characters. I also liked the names given to the Itlantean cities, and how the name reflects the general theme or focus of the city: Celestrus, Primus, Verdus, Arctus, Magmus and Volcanus. \n Ellison's word choice and imagery throughout the novel is beautiful and nicely-fitted to the sea and its imagery. \n I had been wondering about the connection of the title \"Of Sea and Stone\" and the novel itself; I didn't quite figure it out for myself but it came at the end and kept me thinking. \n Given the chance and time, I would definitely look forward to see more of Aemi and her adventures, particularly as the novel ends at a climactic point. \n Of Sea and Stone is a clean young-adult novel, and I truly liked that and that there was not much - if any - romance in the novel. \n Overall rating: 4.5 stars \n Note: I received a free copy in return for an honest review by Xpresso Book Tours and as part of a Blog Tour."}

The story begins with two children who each have incredible potential, dysfunctional families, and a horrific school environment. They become friends out of desperation. Patricia tries to cope with the world using magic and Laurence is drawn to science and technology. Between the two of them they manage to create a computer intelligence that studies and directs mankind. The factions that each of them join up with as adults could either save or destroy mankind and the planet, and are seemingly willing to take that chance to affect change.

It's as though he poured in everything he thought he knew about noir, hard-boiled, bad-ass dialogue. But none of it works; it's just forced and awkward. His overall style is juvenile and inconsistent, and I didn't care about his characters. \n The story, on the other hand, is the reason I finished the book. The premise is interesting enough, although the last fifty (or one hundred) pages didn't justify the hours of reading I put into this. \n The \"Mount Char\" of the title is explained like this: oh, remember that random anecdote our character recounted in the middle of the book? That's relevant now and is why this place is called \"Mount Char.\" Jesus. \n And the explanation comes just as the book is ending, and by that time, I'd forgotten that I didn't know why it was called \"Mount Char,\" and I really didn't give a shit. \n I'd like to unfollow whoever tweeted out her recommendation about this book, but I can't remember who it was.

Across this sprawling story, he manages to tie things up well in what was, for me, a very satisfying ending.

You may have heard that it is a vampire book, which is only vaguely true. This is more of an outbreak book, that involves a virus that can mutate people into a sort of vampire like creature, most often called \"Virals\" or \"Smokes\". It began as a very convert government project using death row prisoners, high up in the Colorado mountains. Except the monsters they created were far, far smarter than their inventors could ever have dreamed of. While the Virals are the constant threat, the real story lies in how the humans try to adapt to a rapidly changing world where they are an isolated minority and prey to the creations of \"science\". This book is reminiscent of Stephen King's \"The Stand\" in it's scope, diversity of slowly intertwining story lines, and bold look at humans in crisis, as well as an overlying mystical quality to it that waxes and wanes throughout the hundreds of pages of the book. This tale grips you hard and won't let you go. I was literally exhausted when I finished reading it because I lived every moment with those people--Cronin's story telling ability is mesmerizing.\""}

{"text": "I should pay more attention to the blurbs of books, honestly. Lisa McMann calls Unraveling Isobel creepy? How could I not listen to that? \n I went into this book assuming it was generally about Isobel and her possible mental illness, not knowing that I was going to be so scared that I would only read this in the daytime. Yes, the summary does mention ghosts, but there are different ways for ghosts to be written about. Here's a warning: Eileen Cook knows how to scare the pants off of you. Or that's true if you're a wuss like me, at least. There's a reason I don't read much in the thriller genre. \n Overall, minus the feeling scared bits, I did enjoy Unraveling Isobel. I enjoyed Cook's writing style, and the plot kept moving along at a nice pace. It's a mix of thriller and mystery, so as you work your way through the book as a reader you get to work out clues and coincidences with Isobel. Some are easy to figure out and some are not, so even the most sleuth-y will be entertained (plus, it's slightly harder to be a detective when things like possible ghosts/mental illness are involved). \n I fully intend on picking up Cook's first novel now, as I know I enjoy her writing style. I also intend on paying more attention to obvious references to creepy in the future. (Or everyone could make it easier on me and make the titles very obvious. Like Anna Dressed in Blood.)"}

It is a fast and passionate falling in love by two people who each have no intention of ever doing anything of the sort. But the Raintree family is under attack and both of these detectives are soon fighting for their lives and for the lives of their loved ones.

Many others will be screaming for my blood for having the temerity to do so. \n I loved, really loved, the world building. As a background for this kind of tale I take my hat of to the author with no qualms whatsoever. The plot was well executed, the characters well conceived even if the relationships seemed a little sketchy in places. \n The concept of gender blindness in their society is well handled, the relationship between Varis and Kiril is almost a throwaway line, Khelsea and Gemma a couple of no note. However apart from Savedra's parents and royalty you wonder where these people come from. \n speaking of Khelsea she represents another small problem. Women in positions of authority and power as a matter of course is great and it fleshed the world out well, it's a ghost of a world this might have become, but I struggle to remember anyone in office who wasn't a female. Isyllt's inspector friend, the coroner, the Captain of the King's Guard, who has one of the best running jokes in the book by the way, the Archas of the Eight, the society is run by women it would seem, but at the top of the pile is a King. There's a slight imbalance which grows as the book unfolds. It's a small thing but it's there. \n Getting late, so I'll come back and finish this later."}
{"text": "I'm not quite sure what Maguire was attempting with this one - a retelling of Alice or a commentary on Victorian England?

{"text": "I really enjoyed this book and, in fact, spent a few nights last week curled up in a chair reading it all evening long. It certainly has magical elements, but also has history and travels to various locations. \n The book certainly could have used a better editor though, as parts drag. And I was disappointed (oddly) that there are other books to come. Not knowing any better, I kept waiting to things to start wrapping up. The ending really leaves you hanging, though I'm sure the next book will pick it right up."}

Full review to come. \n Edit 6/23/2017 \n See full review for Lord of Shadows at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n I chose the worst time to start reading this book, let me tell you. Usually a book like this will take me at most four days to read at work, especially if it is slow. But I started this book during the busiest time of year and there were days where I didn't read anything. Because of that I'm hoping that's why Lord of Shadows felt rather clunky. Otherwise, I loved this book to pieces. The drama was top notch. All the relationships that were formed (and broken) were beautifully well done and the story really progressed from book one."}
{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n I am a HUGE Tamora Pierce fan, and have been for about 17 years now. There is no author writing fantasy geared at teenage girls that I love half so much as I love this woman. After more than 25 years of writing and 25 books, Tammy still manages to surprise and impress me with her wry, no-nonsense approach to juvenile fantasy. Her teenage heroines specialise in kicking ass and taking names, and while they like their men, no one will accuse them of being unable to take care of themselves. Beka Cooper is no exception. \n In Bloodhound, the second of the trilogy, Beka has begun her first year as a Dog (essentially, a cop) in the pseudo-Medieval fantasy kingdom of Tortall. She's 17, unable to find a decent working partner, and someone is flooding the country's coinage with counterfeits. Tammy has made the bold choice in this book of removing Beka to an unfamiliar city (both for her and for the reader) to track the culprits, separating our heroine from most of the cast of characters we met in the previous book, including her magical pet cat, on whom Beka has come to rely a little too heavily. My favourite addition to the cast is Achoo, a scent hound whom Beka adopts when she is mistreated by her previous handler. \n One of the things I especially love about Tammy's books is that morality is rarely black-and-white; thieves live by their own code, and can often become friends or lovers of Dogs without anyone batting an eye. As long as everyone plays by the rules -- written or not -- everything works fine. \n Sex is also dealt with frankly (but never explicitly) in this book -- more baldly, perhaps, than in any of Tammy's previous books. Beka takes for a lover a man she barely knows, fully aware that their affair must, perforce, be a brief one. The romance is almost incidental to the plot, and her new lover takes little part in the action of the book. Beka's love-life takes second place to her main focus: Her job. She and the new man enjoy their time together, and part on good terms, though Beka is saddened when she knows she must leave. Beka's romance with Rosto, her flame from the previous book, is left on the back burner, and we barely see him, though he is frequently in Beka's thoughts. \n This is also the first time we get an explicitly gay character in a major role in one of Tammy's Tortall books. Usually, her characters' sexualities are only hinted at -- because, as Tammy says, her books are not \"about that\" -- but now we have Nestor, Beka's friend and superior officer, who we are told is gay the first time we meet him. We also meet his companion, a male-to-female transexual named Okha, who works as a singer in a tavern, and has ties to the city's criminal element. Both of them are well-thought-of by the other characters in the book, reflecting a very open-minded society. \n All in all, an excellently-written story, though I don't yet love Beka as much as I love Alanna. Highly recommended for ages 12 and up."}
{"text": "See full review for Unhooked at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n Gwen Allister is sick of moving. For the umpteenth time her mother and her move again, this time to a new flat in London and she isn't happy about it at all because she started putting down roots the last time they moved. In fact, her best friend Olivia, comes with them to help them out for the next two weeks and that is pretty much the only thing that Gwen is happy for. But eventually she knows that Liv is going back home and she'll be stuck here with her mother who believes that the fairy mural painted in the second bedroom in their new flat is real and that they are watching her. \n On the first night, Gwen is awoken by something moving in the shadows and making noises, she thinks it's just a draft of some sort, until a hand clutches over her mouth and lifts her up and out of her room. After a freaky light show, some flying, and possibly a cannon fight, Gwen finds herself falling into water and losing consciousness. When she wakes up she is on board a ship and its Captain welcomes her to the last place she ever thought possible. Neverland. Only this isn't the land from the stories and Captain isn't the villain he is made out to be. Pan, on the other hand, just might be the villain and he wants Gwen no matter the cost. \n So Maxwell had a lot to live up to with her rendition of Hook, and she did come close to beating Killian, but she fell just a little bit short. The first few chapters were a little slow and didn't give too much information, but once Gwen drops into Neverland the pace picks up and the witty conversation flies."}
{"text": "This book got a bit better at the end. If you can get past the almost nausiatingly cute sweet teen romance where all the two characters want to do is kiss and such then you'll be okay. Oh and if you can ignore the Miss Amnesty Internation stuff which is toned down in this book (the first book it was a little too much). The first half of the book is slow in there is a lot of the too cuteness but after it it gets better. \n The characters haven't grown but they are starting to grow in this book. And there is an introduction to new characters that will no doubt come up in later books. \n The big battle is coming in this book and everything is preparing for it. The action starts to heat up a little which is a nice change of pace. \n There were two things that got me: \n So the girl is turning blue (Yes blue as in smurf blue) and she's in a public place. So her sidekick friend takes out face paint and paints her and her friends faces? I mean I wasn't a mean kid in high school but I'd have laughed at them. It just wouldn't have happened and it was a bit unrealistic but it wasn't so out there. \n Why is it that they know the woods are bad yet every time something goes wrong the girl runs into the woods? That's just asking for trouble there. \n Overall this was a decent book, there were typical roll your eyes teen stuff but it had a little substance and I'm looking forward to the third book and seeing what happens."}
{"text": "For me this was an okay book, a light (not exactly light) book to read when you lots of time on your hands. \n The main thing I liked about this book was the growth of both the main characters. It had just the right amount of humor and teen-angst and romance. On the other hand I felt it went the writing went too slow. At many points during the story I felt like giving up, and only my will-power urged me to finish it. Another thing is that the story line was too simple. It was like an idea a primary-school student would come up with. So altogether 2.5 stars."}
{"text": "Gosh DARN it. I was convinced that this book couldn't be any good; it had gotten too much hype. Alas, the hype was warranted. This book is what Twilight should have been - a strong female (several, actually), some fantasy elements, and a hot guy (who's not afraid of strong females) in Rome. Yeah, they're killing the killer unicorns, but you would be, too, just to get in on Peterfreund's action. Yes, yes, it's that good."}
{"text": "Forget-Her-Nots has a unique plot, as it deals with the language of flowers. I have yet to read a book that comes close to dealing with this sort of 'magic,' so I had a lot of fun hearing the meanings of the flowers and reading about them being used. \n Overall I was slightly disappointed, because the novel seemed more middle grade than young adult to me. The plot was very basic, and the characters were not as deep as I normally like. I did not get to read much about the boarding school, which is one of my favorite book topics, so I was sad about that - and I was confused about the friendships our main character had. One of the girls was constantly mean and yet still remained in the circle of friends throughout, and I couldn't really figure out why. \n I really like the cover of this book, and liked the basic set up of the plot - I was just hoping for a little more complexity."}
{"text": "On to book 3!"}
{"text": "I don't really know what to make of this book. For everything thing I loved, a few pages later something completely ridiculous would pop up. \n The romance was very sweet. If the entire book had just been about the two of them, I probably would have enjoyed it more. I absolutely adored Rafe. I want one. He upped the book a whole star. Who doesn't love watching a grumpy scarred man who doesn't believe in love fall desperately in love? And Cassandra. She was kind, but for an intelligent woman, she had a serious case of the TSTL syndrome. It's like she wanted to kick the bucket. \n The whole vampire overthrow part of the plot was boring. I ended up skimming most of it. Half of the things that happened revolved around rules of the vampire world that are never really explained. For example, the Mark that connects a vampire and another person can only be be detected within the bounds of the city it was made in? Or is there a certain radius? Is there an invisible line that a person has to cross? Throughout the books, when a vampire feeds on someone, they can see what is in their mind. So why are there constant misconceptions about how the non vampire feels about the vampire? Couldn't they see that when they fed from them? I was so confused. \n From there my confusion continued. Nothing made sense! Why does giving a few vials of blood debilitate a vampire? They can heal a wound in minutes! I've had 12+ vials of blood drawn in one go and I was fine and dandy. Why on earth would a few vials of blood being drawn over a couple of days weaken a supernatural being? Perhaps there is a legitimate reason but it was never explained. \n I'm not a fan of rape as a plot point (or in this case, subplot) in a romance novel, whether it be a main character or a secondary character. I know every book is different and sometimes it's necessary to the plot, but there is a certain way of writing about it that doesn't make you feel like you need to scrub your brain clean. In this case, it was only one sentence that tipped the scale into UGH NO territory. Maybe I'm too sensitive. Perhaps it's all on me, but it's my review after all, and this is something that bothered me. On the plus side (as much as their can be), from the way it was written, I believe it will will play a huge part of a plot in a future book. So while it was unpleasant, I do not believe it was unnecessary. \n Overall, I enjoyed the book. It has a lot going for it. Romance, intrigue, mystery, even a little violence thrown in there (as in fighting). It just wasn't what I was looking for when I picked it up. It was much darker than I thought and perhaps if I was in a different mood I would have liked it more."}

{"text": "Although I read this sequel before the original, I really enjoyed it. It can be read on many levels-- as a thrilling adventure, a lovely trot through references to other children's books, and a reflection on how to live life in the moment and embrace change. I know that sounds like a pile of hooey-- who would see such depth in a young person's novel?-- but the main character's struggles with expressing her tru character enough to find the truth (who captured the Nobodies) is a wonderful metaphor for modern life, with so many choices. The author reminds us all to be ourselves; it's the best choice in the end. Or maybe I'm just assuming that because I'm in the middle of a personal quest myself."}
{"text": "2 and a half Stars. While this book contains a great adventure, mostly seen at the latter portion of the book, the characters didn't jump out at me.

If you're an adventure reader this is definitely worth the time to read. Not sure if I'll be picking up a sequel anytime soon."}

I would have eaten it up as a kid. As it was, I ate it up as an adult. Okay....there....I said it. I found myself back in my childhood fantasy of underwater worlds. I have already sent for book 2.

{"text": "3.5 Multilayered Stars!! \n Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Berkley Trade/Penguin Group \n The Raven starts a couple of years where The Prince left off. In this time we get to see the aftermath of how the potential war played out and with the Prince finally getting his prize possessions. On the surface things are coming to peaceful existence in Florence but the Prince is still unsettled knowing that there may be traitors amongst them and his long ago heart is still void and aching. \n \"Noah released the raven and the raven returned. If I were able to hope, I'd hope you would return to me. Good night, Cassita.\" \n Stumbling across a woman in a near death situation, the Prince goes against their rules and intervenes with the humans to save her. What he didn't realize was that she was going to save him more than she needed saving. \n For Raven, she's a bit plain, overweight and disabled but smart and passionate. After waking up a week later with her being not disabled, thinner and prettier she finds herself smack in the middle of a unknown world. \n After saving Raven, the Prince is intrigued and keeps an eye on her, which is needed as she finds herself in the middle of his world which causes him to save her repeatedly. The more he saves her the more he wants her to go, because he knows that if she stays everything is going to change. \n \"You are my greatest virtue and my deepest vice.\" \n Raven starts to transfer back into her old self which doesn't deter the prince, it actually makes him want her more, as he sees her true beauty. Unfortunately her past causes her to have many walls up that she can't believe that someone can find her attractive but she can believe in supernaturals. \n \"I get tired of evil triumphing over goodness. I get tired of the injustice inherent in the universe and beings, human and otherwise, standing aside and doing nothing.\" \n I liked and disliked Raven. She was brave and smart but stubborn and insecure at other times which made her blind to the reality of what was right in front of her. This stubbornness and insecurity caused her to push away her potential happiness for her wanting to hear magical words. To do this she closed her eyes to everything else, which led her to not listen and see actions. What she wanted was always there she just couldn't believe in it. She was so stuck on works and secrets that I started to get agitated with her 'boo fuckin hoo' woe is me attitude. \n \"I know my failings and I know my fate. I'm supposed to be alone.\" \n \"I can't see how that's possible, since I believe you're supposed to be with me, in my arms, in my bed.\" \n Sylvain Reynard has such a gift at writing so many layers filled with information, details, history, imagination and otherworldly. This makes you fall into the story but at the same time it can also deter as there are at times too many layers that it is hard to keep track of all the ins and outs. You almost feel like you need a spreadsheet to be on top of all the details. \n While the Prince is dealing with his world he's also trying to find balance with the human world and his heart with Raven. \n \"You've ensnared me, Cassita,\" he whispered. \"I've never been less eager to escape.\" \n \"You say no man ever wanted you but when one does-and wants you badly enough to risk everything he's built for you-you tell yourself he's a liar.\" \n \"Let me love you, Raven, with my heart.\" \n I think it will be awhile before we find out who the traitor is amongst them as the depth of this world is just beginning to unfold. I can't wait to jump back into this world and find out how everything plays out for the Prince and Raven as well as the Emersons. \n For more reviews, visit Live Read and Breathe \n Like us on Facebook Live Read and Breathe Facebook \n Follow along with Twitter Live Read and Breathe Twitter"}
{"text": "I really wanted this to be better.... I got fairly excited about the series in Grave Peril, but this installment is much inferior. The ending is a bit contrived, which is unusual for the series, and features an uncharacteristically dumb move by our hero; the plot was less even in timing, and the great character of Michael we introduced in #3 (one of the best secular depictions of a character of faith, in any series) was undermined here by post-modern copy/paste. Even the action was less compelling. \n I still enjoyed the book, and I'll probably go on with the series eventually, but it's telling that I've read several other books since instead of grabbing the next Dresden book."}

{"text": "5 stars \n \"Imagine a person created for you. Another being so in tune with you that their voice was the clearest you've ever heard in your mind.\" \n All her life, Ava Matheson heard voices. These voices classified her as crazy or mental. She couldn't keep relationships because over time, her energy become so huge they overwhelm the person she's with. And there's no explanation for it. As a last resort and referral, she makes her way to Istanbul in an attempt to figure out what's wrong with her. Instead of finding a solution, a whole new world opens up for Ava to discover a love unlike no other she has known before. \n What I enjoy about this book is the creative world building. I didn't really know where the author was going with it. I just had to read and find out. The first quarter of the book felt a bit slow but the wonderful writing is what kept me reading. It picks up after that and you couldn't help but be glued to the pages. \n I love the character development, especially with Ava. She's been hearing these voices all her life so it was easy to see her reactions to everything that unfolded. She questioned everything instead of accepting it at face value. I also understood her insecurities and I'm so glad that Malachi was patient enough to make her see she was worth it. A miracle. \n Malachi... I love the family he has with his brothers, the connectedness they have. I love that he never backed down (well, except for when he confused what Damien said lol) and he never let Ava wavered either. The ending tore my heart out! \n Warning: this book ends with a cliffhanger. I really really need book 2! \n This was my first read by Elizabeth Hunter.

I loved that this book dealt more with magic and magical creatures and I would love for the next book to go even deeper with that.

{"text": "4.5. \n I would do 4 stars, but that feels like it would shortchange everything Bardugo accomplishes in this series. \n I'll start with my disappointment (singular). The climax. It was exciting but without the flash and operatic scope of that of Six of Crows. Can't help but wish for something a bit grander. \n Besides that? Perfection. The writing. The world building. The character work. The conclusion. The notes of pathos. Bardugo orchestrated them perfectly over the course of this duology. This is not a sequel but rather the second half of the story, which is everything you could hope for in a second entry. Bardugo managed to nearly surpass herself in every way. She gives you the exact moments you need, resisting the tempting urge to indulge beyond what is necessary to tell this story. \n I could have read it forever, but I am so happy with how it all tied up. In an age of endless sequels and spin-offs, this novel demonstrates just how important it is to know when to wrap it all up."}
{"text": "Overall the book was well written but it lacked in story. The story was shallow and easily predictable. It was clearly written by an atheist and pokes full at all religion.

I feel that the overall story could have been put into one book under 600 pages and come off stronger. A trilogy in this case seems to just be a way of making money and isn't needed."}

After being cast out of the Daggers - the only group that really accepted her for what she was - and losing the love of her life, she doesn't know what to do now. She takes her sister with her as they try to find a legendary Elite - Magiano. No one knows what his powers are, but Adelina knows that if they can get him on their side they can do anything. It isn't until they do find them, that everyone realizes there really isn't a next step. Not until Adelina offers him the best prize of all - The Crown's Treasury. But to do that they have to get past the Queen's Inquistor - Teren - and kill the Queen herself. \n As more people join her party, Adelina realizes that she can create her own group like the Daggers and be their leader. Even though her illusions are starting to get away from her again. And then she runs into the Daggers and realizes that they're up to the same plan. In a way. Only instead of killing the Queen and taking the throne for themselves they want to put Enzo on the throne. The prince who died in the last book. It turns out that Maeve - the Queen of Bedlain - has the power to retrieve him from the Underworld, but he needs to be anchored to someone - someone that can control him because when he comes back he will be ten times as powerful as he was before he died. Adelina and the others know that they can't let the Daggers win this one, but can they really risk anchoring Enzo to Adelina when she isn't really in control of herself? \n I was so excited to read this book, that when it finally became available on the digital library I wanted to start it immediately. But as soon as I did, I started getting kind of freaked out. This book was dark, and I mean darker than even the last book."}

{"text": "I always have liked the Tiffany books. She's a spunky heroine, a serious thinker, and still in many ways a child -- as she should be. Tiffany is full human... err... witch. Pratchett writes in a nice, flowing style that introduces his \"grown up\" characters (like Granny Weatherwax) in a way that will delight children, but without the sensually-inclined input of Nanny Ogg. It's a lovely little adventure in which Tiffany encounters a new evil and... well, does she save it? Get rid of it? Earn a proper witch hat? \n It'll make you laugh out loud at times, and smile as you ponder the depths of the profound mind behind it -- a mind that can, in a single chapter, pay subtle tribute to the movie \"Babe\" only to turn around and give you something profound to ponder."}

Apparently that is the last straw for her mother and she ships her off to a two month summer camp for delinquents and troublemakers. \n To be honest, when I was halfway through this novel I was half tempted to either not finish it or finish it and not read the rest of the novels in this series. Kylie was downright annoying and very whiny. But what saved this book was how quickly she made friends with her two roommates and Lucas's constant attention towards her."}

{"text": "See full review for Lady Midnight at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n So, like many people in the supernatural/YA world this book was pretty much one of the biggest releases for me in 2016. I've been reading about this new series from Cassandra Clare since City of Heavenly Fire was released. I was excited. I liked the fact that we were jumping from New York to LA and that we were going to focus on Emma and Julian. When we met them in CoHF I was kind of intrigued by them and I couldn't wait to read more of their story. Five years after the events of CoHF, Emma is still looking into the deaths of her parents who she is convinced were not killed by Sebastian Morganstern and Julian is busy raising his fellow siblings while also petitioning the Clave to send Mark and Helen back home. But something weird is going on between Julian and Emma, and with the appearance of a contingent from Faerie things get even weirder. \n This novel pretty much has it all. Murder and intrigue. Forbidden love. Drama. Angst. And yes, even the occasional argument over who is the hottest Avenger (Thor, obviously)."}
{"text": "4.5 \n Absolute perfection! I loved the hero, the heroine, the world the author created, the hero, the plot, the secondary characters, the hero, and...well, you get the picture. The ending was \"Wow\", and \"Sigh\", and \"Give Me More\"! Sooooo good!!"}

{"text": "5 stars \n What a read!! \n When I first started the book, I hadn't really known what to expect. The world building was written in a way that you learn more about it and its characters as you go. As a reader, you get to discover the mystery of Meg Corbyn, a cassandra sangue (blood prophet), as she gets revealed to the Others. She's on the run from the \"Controller\" and has found a safe haven within the Others' Courtyard. The book is written with lots of rich description about this world. The first half of the book felt slower to me as development has to be built, but past that point, I couldn't put it down. Heck, I finished this at 4 am! Lots of action packed into it, and I was practically on the edge, white-knuckled, couldn't read or turn the pages fast enough to find out what's happening next. I want to jump right into the next book but I'll pace myself until the 3rd book is released. \n Amazing read, and one unlike anything I've read before. Loved it!"}
{"text": "A Million Junes was a fantastic second novel for Emily Henry. I wasn't a huge fan of her debut, but this one completely blew me away. I fell in love with June and her family right away. I loved their portrayal of a blended family, and that although June missed her father, she still loved her mother, stepfather, and brothers as her family. June and Saul's banter was also really fun and added a lighthearted note to this emotional story. I loved the way that their relationship developed, and how they explored their pasts together. The flashbacks and the ancestor characters were a bit confusing to follow at times, but they helped to understand the characters. I liked how this book had supernatural elements but it also had normal high school issues as well, including June considering new possibilities for her future. Overall this book was an incredibly unique and heartwarming story about family, love, and loss, and I would highly recommend picking it up come release day."}
{"text": "This installment was a great end to the series. The way Collins considers and details the social and political world she has created made this a series not just for kids, but for adults, too. This is a story about growing up, but it's also a story about power, battle, and compromise, which are topics not always done so interestingly in young adult or children's literature. \n Collins never talks down to her audience, but she never talks above them, either. It's amazing how she is able to make war and betrayal so relevant to her twelve year old protagonist, and it's due in large part to the complete and complex world she's created. \n And without spoiling anything, I can say that although I'd hoped for another kind of ending, I knew how unrealistic my hopes were and I think Collins finished the book--and the series--perfectly. This really is a great adventure for all readers."}

{"text": "To start, the Vampire Academy books are the best of their genre and I'm including teen vamp series' like Morganville, the Unmarked books and even the 'adult' Sookie Stackhouse books. \n The backstory and history are much more robust and the characterisation is far superior, even if some points are quite laboured. For example, bizarrely even though she seems to have high emotional intelligence, has no idea Adrian is crushing on her. Even if she's immune to him in person then Jill's weird behaviour, given what she knows of spirit must be an anvil. Also it is clear from early on that Trey has another purpose than a match maker. \n Anyway I digress. The book sets up a really interesting story arc to be explored - how far will Sydney go for example to be loyal to the alchemists or loyal to herself. But everyone know's she'll be powerless to Adrian in the end."}
{"text": "Loved every minute. So sad there isn't another! \n I thought JK really made Harry an even stronger archetypal hero - almost in a Paul Maud'Dib from Dune kind of way. He's fighting the ultimate evil, he's brave and takes risks, and believes in himself and doesn't give up despite many hardships. I think JK really did a phenomenal job, as I bet every kid who reads this will have a little bit of hero/Gryffindor in them. \n The epilogue was lame though. I would have rather seen a '3 months later' epilogue than a '19 years later' one."}

{"text": "In Book 4 of the Patternmaster series, the world is not faring well. The seeds of destruction have been sown in the earlier books. The Patternists have extremely developed mental powers. They can telepathically link with each other to communicate, heal or kill. Patternists live in enclaves controlled by the most powerful of their kind. Their mortal enemies are the Clayarks - descendants of the survivors of a plague brought back to the planet by an astronaut. These creatures refer to themselves as sphinxes and have human heads on somewhat cat-like bodies. Regular humans (or mutes) are victimized by both races. The Patternists use them as slaves. The Clayarks torture and eat them. The Patternmaster is the one Patternist who can link with all of his people. The current ruler is dying and a power struggle to succeed him has begun. Octavia E. Butler has created an epic story. Be sure to read the books in the correct order to fully appreciate the arc of her vision."}
{"text": "I received a copy of this book via Goodreads' Don't Buy My Love program in exchange for an honest review. \n Honestly, this story was good for...entertainment. \n Henri is a 40-something gay man pursuing an advanced degree in botany. He catches his callous young lover in the sack with any one of a number of men, and promptly departs for a nature preserve to study his main thesis topic (Cobra Lilies) only to find it ablaze in a raging forest fire. Overwrought, Henri plunges into the forest and is overcome by smoke and injured, burned severely. \n Months later he is healed, scarred but striving to find any wild Cobra Lilies to study in time to turn in his thesis. (Lookit, I have a graduate degree--the path of Henri's studies absolutely does not jive with my educational experience, and I had two children in grad school. There's grace given to students who have suffered injury or illness, so the big push to finihs was to me, silly. But whatever, the plot is kinda silly...) \n Henri gets wind of a reclusive greenhouse owner who may keep Cobra lilies, and he seeks out this floral Mecca only to come into contact with the most sexually dazzling creature he's ever seen. I mean, a flawless specimen of manflesh who parades about his greenhouse nude, watering his plants and speaking tenderly to them? It's Henri's dream come to life. \n Ambrose is a spider setting his web, however, and he seduces Henri into sex. (Not too hard) Henri's sure this is freaky-deaky when not only do the plants get in on the act, but Ambrose bites him and drinks his blood. Yep. Ambrose is a vamp. \n Henri is stunned to learn that Ambrose's bite can heal the pain of his burn scars, yet, after a second night of passion and research, he flees, suddenly afraid that Ambrose will drain him. Strangely, he returns to school to find his thesis advisor now up for blowing his tenure by sexually blackmailing Henri. O_o \n Henri is partially temporarily healed by Ambrose's bites, and he's totally attracted to Ambrose, but he's freaked by the vamp thing. He decides to return to Ambrose--after he takes a 3000 mile journey into the wilds of the American southwest. He and Ambrose share a novel telepathic link that brings Henri rushing to the rescue when Ambrose's health fails. \n Oh, and immortal HEA. \n All of this happened in a tidy novella. So lots of plot, not all of which made sense. There was a whole lotta smexytimes, most of which was human-to-vampire but some of which included some floral elements..."}
{"text": "If, like me, you looked forward to those stories in the Grimms' collections in which there was a clever solution to a piece of trickery, or a particularly cunning way of defeating the nemesis, you will love that these tales have been collected by Kathleen Ragan to engage your mind, albeit on a different level. Ragan collected these stories - pre-existent, not written by her - from all around the world. They are stories that feature heroines: females who are worthy of emulation and around whom the tale centers. They are not scheming crones or vapid maids. These characters are strong, they act, they think. You'll love them."}
{"text": "This is a shifter story and had some of the elements I've come to expect in such a tale, such as the mate bond. The mates in this case are Joe (the human) and Cal (the werewolf). But this story had something a little different. The werewolves of the world are gradually being wiped out by a group of hunters. These hunters have killed most of Cal's family and he's on the run. There's plenty of change for Joe to play hero and luckily he has connections - men he can ask to come and help in the fight to protect his mate. Finally there is a link to politics. So while some parts of the story are expected, there are some nice bits of originality! The characters drew me in and the pace saw me get to the end in no time. Now I just need book 2 because this one leads directly into the next story where we find out (hopefully) what happened to Cal's family."}
{"text": "Crosspost: thereadingbelle.com \n I have been looking forward to reading Winter ever since I finished Cress last year. Winter has been on my tbr list for a very long time. When I got the book, I immediately wanted it read it, but I had other books I had to read first. It has been the longest book that I have read for this year!!! [?] e=e=(ng >pu<)6 [?] \n I really found the last book to be really amazing. The series got better with each book. I liked Cinder, Scarlet was better, Cress was amazing, and Winter was epic. I really can't believe that the adventure is finally over. (*[){ [)*) \n As I mentioned, this book is massive and there are so many things that were happening in this book. Honestly, I felt that this book should have been a bit longer just because I felt some of the characters did not have enough screen time. For example, I felt that Winter did not have enough time as the other characters. She is one of the most complex heroines. She refuses to use her lunar gift, but she is mentally ill because of it. I really liked how Marissa Meyer handled her character. Winter was really precious. I loved her friendship with Scarlet, since at first Scarlet didn't trust her, but eventually their friendship grows. \n \"Winter tilted her head in Scarlet's direction. A spiral of black hair fell across her cheek, obstructing her scars. \"What did you bring me today?\" Scarlet asked. \"Delusional mutterings with a side of crazy? Or is this one of your good days?\" \n What I loved was how all the characters are based on fairy tales. I liked how Meyer gave the Snow White story a twist. Though I wish Winter and Jacin had more of a backstory. Secondly, this book had many comedic moments! +([?]+) \n Thorne scoffed. \"Careful is my middle name. Right after Suave and Daring.\" \n \"Do you even know what you're saying half the time?\" asked Cinder. \n Oh how I am going to miss Thorne so much. \n \"Thorne's voice pitched high in imitation of the queen. \"The impostor of my beloved niece is vanquished ... Let us put this messiness behind us while we go forward with the coronations ... I am a psychotic, power-hungry nut basket and my breath smells really bad under this veil.\" \n It was a good balance with the drama that was happening. I did like the bromance between Kai and Thorne. \n Other than that, Levana is still evil and just as crazy. There were moments where I was feeling pity towards her, but Levana is not redeemable at all. I won't spoil anything because you have to read this book. It's dramatic and action packed, and it made me teary eye by the end of the book. I will really miss these characters. I will miss their adventures. I will truly miss The Lunar Chronicles. At least Stars Above is coming out next year! Can't wait for the epilogue! 2( * )7 \n My favorite pairings: \n Cinder and Kai - Loved this couple from the beginning of the series. Of course, they would be my top pairing. Kai and Cinder sacrifice so much for each other, and I was glad that they have a happily ever after. \n Cress and Thorne - I would have loved it even more if they had more moments together. They have the funniest moments, and they are one of the cutest pairings. \n Scarlet and Wolf - I love this couple, they have many great moments in the last book. They have been through so much in this book. \n Winter and Jacin - They have loved each other since they were young and they are childhood friends. I would have wished for more moments between Jacin and Winter. I felt they were a bit under developed compared to the other pairings, but they did have their cute moments. \n Quotes: \n \"A kiss from the Captain would probably melt my central processor.\" \n Thorne winked at her. \"Oh trust me. It would.\" \n \"Help me. Fight for me. And I will be the first ruler in the history of Luna who will also fight for you.\" \n \"I can't believe this is happening. I can't fight like this, or start a revolution, or be a queen. I can't do anything like this. I'm broken. I'm literally broken.\" Iko settled a hand on Cinder's shoulder. \"Yeah, but broken isn't the same as unfixable.\" \n Final Rating: [?][?][?][?][?] .. .:*deg.. .:*deg.. .:*deg.. .:*deg"}

The school hid in plain sight in London by masquerading as a construction site since no one of quality would look in their direction. :) And Sophronia was able to pass a note with the tip since no one would be low enough to look at money. \n She claimed all manner of mistreatment at the hands of the Countess.

{"text": "Apollo has been punished by Zeus and turned into a human. It's not the first time that happens, but this time he has no powers and no strength. He doesn't even have his bow. All he has is a driver's license and 100 dollars. He's saved from some bullies by Meg, a daughter of Demeter who has been raised in the streets and claims his services. He finds Percy and gets his help to go to Half-Blood camp, where he learns that every medium of communication is malfunctioning, campers have disappeared and the Oracle is under control of his old rival. With the help of Chiron, Meg, and everyone else at the camp (including his sons Will and Austin and his daughter Kayla) he needs to find the last remaining Oracle so they can have a prophecy and save the world. \n I liked this book. The story was fun, fast paced and Apollo was a good narrator most of the time. He was a bit annoying but he is/was a god, so that was part of his character. I liked that it continues the story from The Heroes of the Olympus, so we get to see Percy, Nico (not a fan but oh well) and even Leo at then end. The thing is, it seems that Percy, Annabeth and Grover won't be part of these stories, and I'm not really a fan of Jason and Pipers, wich will likely appear in the next books. I wish Riordan used his original characters instead of adding so many new ones. It's like, we have Percy, Annabeth, Grover. Then we have Jason, Piper, Leo, Hazel, Frank, Nico, Reyna... then we have other characters like Thalia, Tyson and Clarisse. It's just too much. I love the universe, but I can't keep up. Maybe I'm too old. \n Anyway, I didn't like Meg. He was too childish and her whole her being Nero's stepdaughter and thinking of \"the Beast\" as someone else was too farfetched. I know it can happen in cases of extreme abuse but it felt forced. \n I'll read the next one, but I feel that while I love the old characters, I'm getting tired getting a glimpse of them and having to like the new ones."}

{"text": "See full review for Dead Until Dark at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n Welcome to Bon Temps, Louisiana where the vampires are out and trying to go mainstream with the humans. Sookie Stackhouse has been wanting to meet a vampire ever since they came out of the coffin two years ago, and it isn't until a fateful night while she's working at Merlotte's that a vampire walks in and sits in her section. She's excited to finally meet a vampire and she's even more excited when she realizes that she can't hear him. It tuns out that Sookie has had a disability since she was a kid where she can hear everyone's thoughts. This disability has pushed people away from her over the years and not a lot of people definitely know about the ability. They suspect but don't really know for sure. Hence her nickname 'crazy Sookie.' \n When she realizes that the vampire - Bill - is silent to her she's even more over the moon. But things are short lived when the Rattray's ( a really nasty couple) leave the bar with the vampire. The Rattray's are drainers and have moved on to their next victim. Sookie goes to stop them and succeeds much to Bill's astonishment. A few nights later the Rattray's get her back though with every intention of killing her until Bill interferes. An uneasy friendship blossoms between the two of them, with him agreeing to stop by her grandmother's group the Grateful Dead to talk about his time during the war. But her grandmother, being the sneaky woman she is, sets the two of them up and they do fall for each other. \n However, there are mysterious murders going on in town and the victims have bite marks on their inner thighs. Not to mention of group of vampires show up who are looking for trouble and then there is that blonde vampire Eric who runs a bar in Shreveport and has taken an interest in Sookie much to Bill's disdain."}
{"text": "Things I love about Armentrout's style of writing: \n She is so subtle with how she approaches YA- to elaborate further, she takes these age-old cliches and tropes and revitalizes them. \n She is a master at creating all these points of tension which engages us readers. \n She infuses her special brand of humour into the writing and the characters making them so lovable. \n And okay, I'll admit it. I may have given Onyx five stars just for the unresolved sexual tension. It was killing me inside but at the same time, I was loving every second of Daemon and Katy. (That bit with the cookie? Wooosh, there went my panties. All monks and nuns beware.) \n \"Cookie?\" he offered, holding a cookie full of chocolate chips. \n Upset tummy or not, there was no way I could refuse that. \"Sure.\" \n His lips tipped up one side and he leaned toward me, his mouth inches from mine. \"Come and get it.\" \n Come and get...? Daemon placed half the cookie between those full, totally kissable lips. \n Oh, holy alien babies everywhere...\" \n Other woooosh moments: \n \"What was that?\" he whispered, eyes narrowed. There was no mistaking the amusement in the tilt to his lips, though. \"Very bad kitty...\" \n \"Crossing the room, he stopped infront of me. \"I'm not going to bite.\" \n \"That's good.\" \n \"Unless you want me to,\" He said with a devilish grin.\""}

{"text": "I really loved this novel - I've read other books by Mitchell and think he's a great author, and this book definitely didn't disappoint. \n The book tells the story of Holly, both from her point of view and from other people's point of view. The story is told in installments set about 10 years apart, from the 1980's up to the 2040's. Holly's life becomes intertwined with an ancient supernatural battle - at first she remains unaware of this, but later she has to participate more fully. Various characters she meets throughout her life are also entangled in this web of natural and supernatural events that determine the course of her future. \n I really like Mitchell's writing style and his way of bringing characters to life. The different parts in the novel are written from the point of view of different characters, which means Mitchell switches his writing style and word-choice accordingly. The characters become very lively and 'real' because of this. The novel has a very intricate setup with both a 'natural' storyline about events in the normal everyday world and a supernatural storyline that is closely connected to the natural storyline. Different people show up in different times and places, showing close links between their lives. \n Another thing I like about Mitchell's novels are the returning characters. Characters who were less important in earlier novels take on more prominent roles in this novel. Somehow, to me, it feels like this makes the characters more 'real' - like they have an actual life outside of the novel and we catch glimpses of their lives. \n The novel keeps you on the edge of your seat as the story unfolds. Though the alternating narrators can sometimes be frustrating when you want to know what happened to a character, and then the pov changes, but it definitely keeps you reading. Mitchell manages the separate storylines wonderfully and manages to make them come together in a coherent whole. \n Reading this book makes me want to (re)read all of Mitchell's work right away..."}

{"text": "Interesting take on the paranormal world \n This book was suggested to me by the lovely ladies of my book club and now I'm suggesting it to everyone else. You won't regret it. It is full of action, adventure, comedy, and romance. You'll get a little of everything and keep your butt at the edge of the seat wanting to know what happens next. This is great as well for those who aren't a big fan of cliffhangers. This ends nicely and is definitely left open for more adventures to come and leaves you wanting to see what's in store for the team on their next adventure. While the team is perceived with their strengths, they are also presented with their weaknesses to make it more relatable and likable. Also, this isn't like most books I've read where it starts out slow because the author has to give you a picture and background on the setting and characters. The background and back stories are given to you as the book progresses. You get a better understanding and grasp of each characters better as the book goes on. The characters also grows and matured much more smoothly this way than if we were given the whole background first. At least that's what I think and liked it this way a lot more. The book smoothly moved and transitioned from one to the next and it was over before I know it. I can't wait for the next book to come out."}
{"text": "See full review for A Game of Thrones at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n A Game of Thrones takes place in a fictional land called Westeros and there are seven kingdoms (houses really) that make up the land. The three main families that you need to keep in mind are the House of Stark - they rule the land to the North and Eddard Stark, the head of the family, is good friends with the king and has been forever; House of Lannister - they are a very powerful (and deceitful) family, the eldest son Jamie killed the previous king, the daughter Cercei is married to the king and birthed three children, and the youngest son Tywin is an Imp and hilarious to boot; and then there is the Targaryens - the family who used to be on the Iron Throne and consists of Viserys the eldest son and Daenerys the only daughter who is at the whim of her older brother as he tries everything in his power to win back the crown that they lost. But as it is put home a lot in this book, when you play the game of thrones you either live or you die and winter is coming. \n Right, as mentioned, this books is lengthy and that was one thing I remember from my reading of it three years ago, it was just too long. There are a lot of details that shouldn't be included and there were some chapters that really had no place and actually distracted from the important stuff that was happening to other characters. And then there are the characters! There are so many that it was hard to keep track of who was who - and I'm so clad that this book had an appendix so I could flip back and figure out which house that person belonged to (although if they died, it didn't really matter)."}

{"text": "This book is seriously fucked up, and I loved every second of it. The main character is selfish, morally bankrupt, and pretty much entirely self serving, but he's so brutally funny that you still kinda want him to come out, if not on top, at least reasonably ok. others say that he's completely unrelatable as a character, but I think that's just because we fantasy fans want to believe in the innate goodness of humanity, that we all would rise to be the hero. In Apropos, I think we have the truest representation of how a real person would react to a given set of circumstances. \n Even more, I loved that the princess, Entipy, actually had a personality. she wasn't the naive waif who waits for her hero (mostly, anyway) and drops little tidbits about love and kindness defeating evil. she's stubborn, and a smartass, a bit sadistic, and generally all \"fuck yeah I'm gonna go ride those unicorns, try and stop me.\" she's gonna make the worst Queen, it's hysterical. \n Watch out for the plot twist at the end, it's a whammy."}

The city is dubbed the new \"Venice\" as New York's streets are now rivers, and the oceans sit about fifty feet higher than before. What life remains is mainly on the upper halves of skyscrapers but the same housing issues of gentrification and pushing out the poor plague the population. \n Though dystopian as a whole, the characters are so freaking lovable, it's hard to not have hope that humanity will survive all of the world's cycles."}

{"text": "UNMARKED is the second book in this series about spirit-hunting teens who are trying to protect Earth from the demon Andras. In book one, UNBREAKABLE, they were right on the cusp of killing Andras--when, unfortunately, they set it free. Yeah. And he's been wreaking havoc and killing people for the last several weeks. \n Okay, so, where UNBREAKABLE left off, the MC, Kennedy had been injured in her escape from the scene when Andras came through to the earthly plane. She and four other teens--Jared, Lukas, Alara and Priest--had banded together because each believed the other part of a mystical Legion of the Black Dove sect. Jared and Lukas are twin brothers who sought the other members out based on documents their father had left behind. Turns out, assembling those documents had actually led Andras to each Legion member, and killed them, which is how Jared and Lukas lost their father and uncle, and Alara lost her grandma, and Priest lost his grandfather, and Kennedy lost her mother--all in one single night. The listing of their names...and it's Jared's biggest secret shame--he wrote the list. \n Kennedy, for her part is despondent. She thought she'd become a Legion member when she exorcised her first ghost, but that didn't happen--unlike all the other Legion members, Kennedy didn't receive her Mark, an insignia handed down to the next Chosen in a family. Unmarked, she recognizes her folly--she was never meant to join them, and she feels utterly alone now that her mother is dead. Her father disappeared years ago, and her aunt has just dumped her into a reform school. \n Haunted by news reports of atrocities no one can explain and gruesome nightmares, both courtesy of Andras, Kennedy recognizes that each day a girl who closely resembles her goes missing. Is Andras hunting her? It seems so, which is why she runs the second Jared and the rest of the Legion turn up at her school. Safety in numbers even if she isn't one of them. \n But their news, of her missing, distant aunt, gets her back on board. The hunt is on for the fifth Legion member, and now it's about fixing the mess she made. Of course, this ghost/demon story is fraught with death and destruction. Kennedy's poised to lose the only people she can trust, and gain some very unsettling allies when the Illuminati come to call. \n Andras is on the prowl, and it's clear he wants to possess Kennedy. She's got some skills in the demon wrangling arena, thanks to her training in UNBREAKABLE, but Andras is too powerful for her. Plus, nobody told her he could jump from person to person like a vengeful louse. No, possession seems a breath away, when Andras targets the one person left whom Kennedy loves in this world. \n The revelation of Jared's mistake sends shock waves through the Legion, just as they need to gather closer--to save one of their own, but Kennedy is determined to fix all her mistakes, and she's got the brains to get the job done right. \n Well, I assume so. Because it looks like the final resolution is gonna happen NEXT BOOK. Stay tuned, peeps! \n As far the book goes, it was an interesting read. It gets a bit explain-y, trying to link all the moving parts together. Turns out Kennedy's mom wasn't such a great gal, and her dad left for (albeit crappy) reasons connected to Legion and the Illuminati--organizations which have for centuries been diametrically opposed as this book purports. It felt a bit deus ex machina when the Illuminati swept in to clean up the Andras mess, but there was still lots of time in the story. Time to go on and explain. In the end, we're left with a demon in chains, another on the loose, with Legion members splitting and Illuminati men hunting. Oh, and a reconnection of the parental-kind in the offing. It fell a bit flat for me. I supposed I should have felt tense, but all throughout I knew this story wouldn't end here, so the urgency wasn't as strong as I would have liked. \n It's still a good read. And safe for kids because, instead of kissing and sex, there's killing and horror. It is a perfect Halloween read, however. And, I'm sure I'll get book 3 when it comes out. I received a review copy of this book via NetGalley. This is my honest review."}
{"text": "See full review for The Iron Daughter at: http://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.w... \n Meghan Chase has upheld her end of the bargain that she made with the Unseelie Court Prince, Ash, and has come with him to the Winter Court. But that was weeks ago, and Meghan hasn't seen him since. She's been trapped in Court waiting for Queen Mab to summon her, but while she's waiting she's been having strange dreams about her battle with King Machina. Finally Mab does summon her to ask her what exactly happened and even when she tells the tale, the Queen doesn't believe her until Ash shows up to back up her story. \n After what happened on their way back to the Winter Court, you would think that Meghan would realize that Ash's indifference to her is to protect her, but she automatically jumps to conclusions and forgets her place. Embarrassed and heartbroken she tries to steal herself away from Ash's harsh words and continue her life at the Court. But that's hard to do when she's in love with Ash, Rowan - Ash's brother - is hanging around, and the whole Winter Court wants her dead. But it isn't until she goes for a walk with Sage - Ash's elder brother - after the Scepter of the Seasons is transferred to the Winter Court's power, that things get a little dicey. Members of the Iron Fey show up in the throne room and attack. Prince Sage tries to fight but is killed and the fey take the Scepter."}
{"text": "I loved A Discovery of Witches and was very much looking forward to its sequel. While I still enjoyed the read and miss the characters now that I am finished, I am a bit disappointed. Certain parts of the book are confusing and assumes one is familiar with Elizabethan history. Also, the book reads slow; I found myself constantly picking up momentum just to feel bored and disinterested for several chapters after. Over all, I feel the book leaves a lot to be desired; the first novel was definitely more enjoyable. It is worth reading though, if you love the characters and wish to follow the story of the lost manuscript. I am looking forward to the third installment."}

{"text": "I was a skeptic for the serial format--until I tried it. Being a busy mom/worker bee/reader/writer/blogger etc I didn't think I could \"waste\" my time on a book that wasn't even CLOSE to done. Silly me. It turned out to be the perfect in-between read for me, for when I have 30-45 minutes of time that I want to read, but don't want to get sucked into a full-length novel. Plus, I always had a new episode to anticipate. Well, until now. Because Season Two is in the books. \n Alexa \"Wraith\" Sterling has lived a double-life too long. By day, she's the anti-life-energy activist owner of Sterling Cybernetics, fighting the good fight to end energy transfers from poor people to wealthy \"high potentials\"--essentially literally 'cashing them out' when their potential earnings outstrip their personal debts. It's a horrific new reality, and resulted in the the early demise of not only her mother, but her father as well. \n So, anyone can understand why Alexa would want life energy transfers to cease, but Alexa's terrifying secret, that she was born adebt collector, is one she does not want to see the light of day. By night, Alexa dons the debt collecting persona of Wraith and preys upon people who illegally purchase life energy trades in order to enhance their youth, appearance, or just for a high. Wraith is a mean mama jamma, terrorizing the wealthy, life-stealers and paying out to sick kids---well, until she can't anymore. \n And, definitely not once she falls on the radar of a fringe group of debt collectors, called Gehenna, who want to render themselves immortal by eternal collection of humans. By turns, Alexa is pressured, with life or death consequences, to undo the good work of her anti-debt collection non-profit, Lifetime. The Gehenna collectors, headed by Molloch, will get Alexa's compliance, or kill her--and all those she loves. Alexa find allies where she can, but she's continually choosing between bad and worse options, always a few steps behind the well-orchestrated plan to de-regulate life-energy transfers and create an open season for debt collectors to ascend into the role of demigods, essentially. \n Throughout, Alexa seeks to save her loved ones, and herself, but mostly to shut down Gehenna and its criminal activity. Working within the Gehenna system isn't really feasible; the debt collectors don't trust her, and surviving each more harrowing experience in their captivity is a challenge even this high potential/debt collector is hard-pressed to manage. And, frankly, lots of other people would have simply walked. \n Not Alexa. She's a warrior in corporate skirts. She may have been dealt a raw hand, but she bluffs and bets her way to the best victory she can. And, we're all the better for this maverick willing, not to buck the system, but to tear it all down if it means saving the world from Gehenna overlordship. If I were lost in a dystopian future, I'd want Alexa by my side. \n There's a good bit of steam, and a love story, but mostly there is an amazing story of endurance and doing the right thing, even if it costs you everything."}
{"text": "3.5 stars \n I liked the world building and the reasonable explanation for mpreg. The danger of male pregnancy and hints of intrigue in the paranormal society add tension.

I'm a lover of Frankenstein tales/films and this one didn't disappoint. I will be continuing on to the next book of the series."}
{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n WOW I'M NOT OKAY AT ALL?? \n Partially because this is the last book in the series (even though there's still Bloodlines, but it's not the same!) and partially because THE ENDING! \n Overall, the book was really good. I liked the switching perspectives between Lissa and Rose and the two different storylines going on, Rose trying to find Lissa's sibling and Lissa trying to clear Rose's name. I do wish that there had been more Rose/Lissa interaction than there was, because the only time they spoke was basically in the last three chapters, but at the same time these last few books have contained huge character development for both of them. In the first few books, and before the first book, the two had been so dependent on each other with the bond and everything, that they could not function without the other. At the end of Blood Promise when Avery attacked Lissa and Rose had to jump in and help her fight her way out of it, that was a huge wake-up call for Lissa. It made her realize that she needed to learn how to defend herself, because Rose couldn't always be there to save her, as much as both of them wanted. Rose also learned that there was more to her identity than just protecting Lissa. Her whole life, her mantra had been \"they come first\" but now it was Rose's turn to come first, and through it all, the two still managed to remain close and be one of the best friendships I've read in a book series. The bond being gone signifies this, they are their own people now, but that doesn't mean they can't stay as close as they were. Like Rose said, they don't need a supernatural bond holding them together, their loyalty is enough. \n Another thing I feel the need to comment on is CHRISTIAN. Christian has been my favorite character since book one, and he too has had tons of important character development and his relationship with Lissa is beautiful. They support each other, and the events of Blood Promise ended up only making them stronger when they got back together at the end of Spirit Bound. But, Lissa aside, at this point Christian has basically lost all of his immediate family. He still has the other royal Ozeras and everything, but Tasha being Tatiana's murderer has probably not helped his reputation-his parents willingly turned strigoi, and his aunt who raised him ever since murdered the queen. His family is definetly going to have a hard time accepting him after this (my poor baby), though his being in good graces with Lissa (the new queen) may improve things a bit for him. All in all, I wish we had gotten to see more of a reaction from him about his aunt, all we got was Lissa saying he was really upset. I hope he (and the others) are at least mentioned in Bloodlines! \n I'm so glad Lissa was made queen, and the \"what have we gotten ourselves into?\" look that she shared with Rose was perfect. Definetly a great way to wrap up the series (though there were still some other loose ends-Adrian, Jill, Eddie-that I'm assuming will be addressed in Bloodlines) and I'm definetly going to miss reading these books...I'll have to reread the first one before the movie next month!"}
{"text": "Well, THIS need a sequel NOW. \n Anyway. \n There were two things I really wanted from this book: something dealing with how uncomfortable it would be for an imaginary friend to actually be real and some emotional scenes involving friends/family finding out about the imaginary/real friend. For the first, wow, yes, the ways in which they both freaked out that someone who knew them so intimately was an independent person were perfect, although there could have been a little more follow-through on how Jared dealt with it by clinging so tightly , and for the second, ...sort of? but not really. I have a very specific narrative kink for characters with this sort of \"I'm always on your side\" secret pact having to finally declare themselves openly, but this sort of teased around the reveal without the full emotional focus I'd been hoping for, partly because there were some other genuinely interesting things going on with other characters in the background. There could still be more in the next book, though! ."}

I also loved learning about the shadows and the things they are actually capable of. The Writing style was still very enjoyable and very descriptive. Now for the cons I guess I just felt like I was reading the same story from Fallen just at a nicer school. I didn't feel as connected to the characters as I did in the first book. And I have to agree with most people about the story being somewhat predictable. I knew Shelby's ex was the bad guy I mean way to make it obvious. I also felt like the battle could have been more intense we build and build and build through the book knowing a battle is coming and then it happens and you're like \"really that's it\" And as I read I get more confused about the love story but I must read on for that to become clear.

{"text": "Ok, I will admit - I chose to judge Paranormalcy a bit by its cover. I am always a little wary when it comes to paranormal elements in books - I much prefer a contemporary realistic setting, and I can get worn out with all of the werewolves and vampires. But the cover on this one is so beautiful that I wanted to try it. \n My favorite thing about Paranormalcy is that the entire world is transformed. We are not living in a 'normal' world that happens to have elves or mermaids - rather, an entirely different picture gets painted. And instead of being surprised when a paranormal creature is introduced, the reader expects it. Which made this more of a contemporary realistic setting... if I lived in that world. I am feeling as though this is not coming across exactly like I'd like to explain it, but hopefully some of you understand what I mean :) \n In the beginning, I was a little skeptical - I wasn't connecting with the characters. Then, a boy gets introduced, and everything from then on is intense and exciting - and not just because the boy happens to be attractive and nice. There is even a plot line which will appeal to those of you that like to solve mysteries. \n I loved reading about all of the paranormals working together and how their strengths were used to assign specific tasks. A werewolf was used as a body guard, for example. We also got to see some interesting creatures that are normally not written about in books. \n The creativity and imagery used by Kiersten White makes Paranormalcy a must read - whether you're wary of werewolves and vampires or not."}
{"text": "Could there be a more perfect book to read in October? No, there isn't. Dracula was the perfect Halloween book. \n Stoker creates the quintessential horror story, one built on suspense, on uncertainty, on the fantastic supernatural.

The only thing that stops me from giving it 5 stars is that it's not life-changing. Dracula just really is an excellent story, one that far surpasses modern horror stories."}

{"text": "Morgan Le Fay is an eighteen year old girl who'd dreamed of being a member of Arthur's Round, an elite fighting force that would counsel and protect Arthur Pendragon when he became king. This is a contemporary society where magic exists, and Camelot is real. Unfortunately, the Pendragon family is under attack by the Luminaries, an extremist group that wants magic to be out in the open, unconstrained by law. The Luminaries tried to kill Morgan and young Arthur in HENGE and again in SWORD. Morgan is, to her credit, a steadfast girl. She's unorthodox, because she refuses to let Arthur come to harm--and believes that people close to him, namely Mordred, are aligned with the Luminaries. \n Still, her behavior is erratic and dangerous, in the eyes of the court, and she'd been sentenced to death for treason for kidnapping Arthur before his enemies could. Without Morgan, Arthur would have been struck down before he even gained his magic. Of course, in forcing Arthur to find Excalibur, Morgan learned a very difficult truth about her heritage--and her relationship to Arthur. \n She's been imprisoned to keep that secret safe, and also, because no one can fully prove, or disprove, her involvement in Arthur's father's untimely death. Lancelot is on her side, however, and when Morgan is sentenced to a life of magicless servitude, he bargains for her release into the Grey Knights. It's not fantastic, but it's not scrubbing toilets either. But, Arthur needs Morgan more than ever, now that he's fifteen and bearing the weight of the crown. He's borderline suicidal, and Mordred's machinations haven't ceased. When Arthur goes missing, it's up to Morgan--who's blood is tied to Arthur's--to head up the rescue mission, and perhaps save her dear friendship with a jaded Merlin. \n Morgan was my kick-ass heroine of 2015, and she's back this year with another rollicking adventure. She's more subdued, however, feeling the full-weight of her crimes, and newly-discovered paternity. She's devoted to Arthur, but her efforts to assist him only lead her into more trouble. Morgan, Lancelot and Merlin have a complicated relationship, with Merlin--who had been completely infatuated--spurning her, while flirty Lancelot is willing to stick his neck out to make her punishment lessened. Merlin comes off as a real whiny dude, making my esteem drop, while Lancelot's a steady man, unafraid to be a hero. The adventure to find Arthur is perilous and pushes Morgan to her very limits. She never quits. I just love that about her. She may be down, but it's always a temporary situation, because her shrewd intellect is always looking for the next opportunity to rise again. By the end, she's not only saved the day, she's saved herself. And that's totally cool. She has romantic feelings for both Lancelot and Merlin, but this doesn't become a love triangle scenario. There are too many hurt feelings to have any real romance. Plus, Morgan's life is not her own for a great deal of the book. She does her best to mend rifts, and it seems she manages to do this quite well. I'm eager to get the next book in this series."}

Those familiar with the park will especially get a kick out of all the secret trap doors, learning about the tunnels under the park, and reading about how these rides come to life. Imagine all the \"It's a small world after all\" dolls in the ride coming after you! Or Maleficent throwing fireballs and trying to freeze you out! \n A lot of people on here are complaining about the writing style - I'll admit it's not perfect. The author jumps quickly from one thing to the next and sometimes all the details get muddled. I also feel like kids who struggle with plot twists might have a tough time with this one. However there's a lot of excitement in this book and a great mix of fantasy/reality - it's practically believable! If you're a fan of Disney and its parks some of the minor issues are just not going to bother you when you read this. \n If you're not a huge fan of Disney you might want to pass on this. I could see this getting a bit tiresome to those who haven't been to the park before or just don't find the idea of the park coming to life after hours that exciting. However for those of you who love Disney and want to read a different take on how good can overcome evil, this is for you!"}
{"text": "2.75 \n I thought Poison Study was fantastic and up to about half way, this book wasn't that bad but then everything changed - the characters were no longer the characters they were in the first book and had devolved rather than evolved. The premise of the first book was so good but it was almost as if the author couldn't decide what the book was to be about and the result is just a mess. Being a fan of fantasy fiction I'm happy to let a lot of things go but some if this just wasn't believable and then started to be a bit, well, cheesy. A real shame as it could have really worked. I'm going to read the next book as I'm interested to see where it is going."}

{"text": "Audio book narrated by James Marsters \n This is the third book of what we could call a steampunk vampire trilogy. I still like the first book the best but this one competes with the second as far as things go. The story once again carries a strong sense of Beauty and the Beast mixed with Romeo and Juliet with a strong steampunk flair. If you liked the first two books, you'll like this book since everything wraps up rather nicely in the end. One ding I had was that I still didn't think there was a satisfactory explanation of why Gareth is different from the other vampires. More on that... \n This book is very similar to the previous two books to the point that they kind of blur together in my mind when I think back on it. The steampunk aspect is kicked up a notch with some mech suit / tanks in this one but you'll mainly see lots of swordplay, gunfire, goggles, and airships again. These are some of the things that kind of run together on me mainly because many of the same characters are involved in similar scenes but the overall plot obviously moves forward to a satisfactory conclusion. \n Don't get me wrong - there are many good things that have carried over from the previous two books. The language and prose used in the previous books still give the feel of characters stuck in the past caused by the vampire attack. The action is crazy and fun with lots of epic battles ranging across Europe. The characters are likable for the most part, although Gareth can be a bit one-dimensional sometimes (His primary motivation seems to be his love for Adele to the discount of everything else). \n Speaking of Gareth, I still don't understand why he is different from all other vampires (I guess you could say his manservant shares his values but he also seems kind of like he's reluctantly dealing with a neurotic master). There was this whole explanation about how Gareth's father didn't like wasting things but that doesn't seem to explain how he could go from seeing people as food to loving a human to the level he does. Even his friend in Paris held similar values but not to the extremes Gareth does. I'd hoped for something like what happened with Angel on Buffy but it was kind of left out there. \n As for the audio side of things, I still enjoyed James Marsters' performance this third time around. He speaks well, uses recognizable voices, and is a pleasure to listen to. I would say that I'd go out looking for books narrated by him, but that's why I listened to this trilogy in the first place ;-)."}

{"text": "See full review for Dead and Gone at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n Well, guys here's the good news. After eight books (yes, eight) where Sookie Stackhouse's life is put into danger by vampires every which way she turns, in book 9, her life isn't put into danger by the undead at all. No, this time some more interesting things are happening. The shifters and Weres come out of the closet like the vamps did a few years ago and despite much trepidation by the species, it actually goes okay. Well, mostly. Arlene - Sookie's ex best friend - kind of freaks out and quits. Sam's mom gets shot by her husband forcing Sam to go take care of her and Sookie in charge of the bar. And Crystal - Sookie's sister-in-law - is found dead on a makeshift cross in the parking lot of Merlotte's. The police think it's a hate crime because of her werepanther nature. \n On top of all that, Sookie finally has to deal with her family blood. The war and enemies that Niall has been really cryptic about have finally shown up and they want Sookie dead. Brendan - Sookie's uncle - doesn't care for the half fay and wants to shut off the fairy world from the humans completely, after he destroys all the half fay. Sookie is number one on that list. You know it's bad when Sookie cashes in both of her favors from the vamps and weres to make sure that she has ample protection. But there is only so much that they can do for her. Especially when one of them is taken out of commission."}

{"text": "4.5 Stars \n This is the third, and possibly final, book in the Cronin's Key series. Alec MacAidan is the key to the survival of the human species. He's only been a vampire for the past 18 months, but he's the Chosen One, if you will, so he's had a busy time of it. I think it's a bit hard to pick this series up at the end, but, having read all the previous books, it's a fantastic adventure/romance. \n In this book, the enemy is a group of otherworldly beings of lycan origin who call themselves Zoan. They are shapeshifters who can also stop time. The Zoan arrived on earth through a portal that opened straight from Hell, and Alec must figure out how to kill them, and shut down the portal before the world is under attack. Alec possesses every talent, or power, ever gifted to the vampire race, and he must use all of them to defeat the Zoan--if he can catch them. \n In the meantime, petrified Zoan are being awakened all over the earth and new portals are opening. It's another race-against-time if Alec, Cronin and their band of vamps will have any chance to save mankind. \n This is a fantastic adventure, though I had a few struggles with the fast pace and the constant motion. Part of the plot hinges on understanding the portals, where they are and how they work, and this means Alec must leap his group of vamps all over the world--in rapid succession--to investigate potential portals. At times, I think I was getting leaping sickness. I didn't get the \"physics\" behind the portals and parts where it was described, of which there are a few, dragged for me. \n That said, Alec is faced by a foe he cannot initially defeat; the Zoan are ancient and possess power greater than his. Cronin is very sincerely worried that this battle may be the last. And, he's partly right. I think the idea of a vampire afterlife was remarkable, and I enjoyed how that was rendered. \n There are so many characters in this series that have become dear to me, and I want to continue reading their stories of adventure. I've truly enjoyed the historical \"borrowing\" Ms. Walker has done to create Cronin and Alec's world and experiences, masking bouts of \"extreme vampire and Zoan activity\" into human tragedy and war has been a fun exercise in thought. \n Plus, the bond of love between Cronin and Alec is so lovely I had to giggle a little at Alec's jealousy when encountering Cronin's former lover. Oh, the intensity! And insanity... ;) Poor Alec and Cronin! They just love each other to pieces--and that's what Alec left behind of the world's largest glacier when his temper took control. There are some tender bits, and I found Alec's newest talent--stopping time--was certainly put to most excellent use when he decided some lovin' was needed RIGHT NOW! Fun! I highly recommend this series."}
{"text": "Entertaining \n Not sure what to tell you. This was a fun read. I was a big X Files fan and this story has that going for it. Didn't particularly like the \"heroine,\" but there is more to her than this story presented. I will probably read the next book to get my questions answered. It was funny and quirky. I like that in a book."}
{"text": "I just typed a long and heart-felt review and then it disappeared into internet nirvana :-/ \n So I will only say this: \n Even though the book got a bit lenghty after about 2thirds of the story, I give full five stars mainly because I enjoyed the humorous style of writing so much..."}

{"text": "Michael Swanwick is a giant writer of small stories. Each entry in this book is a gem that is guaranteed to keep you thinking long after you finish. I tried to pace myself but it was like opening a box of chocolates. One delicious surprise after another and so hard to stop consuming. Although I am sure that I have read Michael Swanwick's stories before in those scifi magazines that I love, this was the first book of his that I ever picked up. I've always been a sucker for a good title. Speaking of which, he has some awesome names for his stories - \"For I Have Lain Me Down on the Stone of Loneliness and I'll Not be Back Again\", \"Of Finest Scarlet Was Her Gown\", \"From Babel's Fall'n Glory We Fled\", \"An Empty House With Many Doors\". Extremely poetic and irresistible. I see from the list inside of the book cover that Michael Swanwick has written many other volumes. Apparently, he has been doing so since 1980. So, I'm a little late to the party but I am ready to join in."}
{"text": "Not really my thing. \n It seems as the exact same story as Twilight, and even though this book is 15 years older than Twilight, I must say I quite like Twilight better - and I do not like Twilight! \n The first 170 pages or so, of the book was rather boring and uneventfull, and then all of the sudden a lot of things happen, but the reader is still kept in the dark of what is going on untill book two. I would not have kept reading if I had not had the two first books in one volume."}

{"text": "What a great start to the 2nd series, thankfully we don't have to wait too long for the release of the next title in the series as Tim amazingly writes so quick which is great when you get hooked and you just want the next one.

An amazing series that I don't want to end!!!"}
{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n This final book in the series, though without the dose of climactic action of the others, was quite satisfying by the end. It took me much longer than the others to read, and I think it's because of the lack of action. The tension, though, wasn't lacking, and the end of this installment certainly left a wide open possibility for the next book. I'll just be happy to read about the imminent love affair between Nessie and Jacob. I can't wait!"}

{"text": "This might be one of those top fantasy series that I love such as Terry Brooks and other such books. \n While it is a tad bit confusing and slow in the beginning, the book has a bit of a captivating factor to it. The characters at the moment aren't anything that other fantasy series don't have but it's just such a great series. \n The magic system is a bit unique and probably what adds to the unique factor of the series and what makes it so fun. \n The chapters switch off between people and it really makes the book flow rather quickly.

The characters grew on me, the author finally fleshed out the Irish fey mythology, and I really got into it. I even approved of the imperfect ending and the promise of a sequel. Looking forward to it!"}

{"text": "I was given a copy of Dragon Fate to review by the author, in exchange for providing an honest and objective review. \n When I read the overview of Dragon Fate I was immediately intrigued. It sounded fantastic, and I was pleased when it did not disappoint. It is a modest length, and appropriate for its genre and content. I felt the pacing was spot on, I never got bored with the story, and I never felt rushed. Furthermore, the details never contradicted themselves and in such an extensive new world, that would be easy for a debut author to do. \n I instantly liked our main character Delno, I was emotionally invested in the story and the characters very early into the story. I loved the fact that the author thoroughly built the world, the lore, and the different locales. I absolutely loved the bond between Delno and Geneava. \n The plot was not only brilliantly revealed and constructed, but original and interesting to boot. The plot and the story as well as the depth to the characters is really what makes this book such a fantastic read. \n What I had trouble with was the dialogue. At times I felt the dialogue was a bit forced. The characters are prone to large bouts of self reflection and great speeches, which while it does further the plot I would have preferred to have some of the dialogue and the characters development and epiphanies as the story progressed be a bit more implied and subtle. At the same time, several of the characters are really quite witty, and I loved their sharp retorts. I found that when the characters relaxed, their speech greatly relaxed and I was able to enjoy it more. \n There were a few errors that could be caught by some additional proofreading, but they were not distracting or glaring. \n I felt like the story ended in the perfect place. I wasn't left feeling unfulfilled, and at the same time I definitely want more. I surely hope there is a sequel in the works. \n In summary I would rate the plot a 5, the characters a 4 the editing a 3 the world building a 5 and the cover a 4 granting an overall score of 4.2"}
{"text": "The Hunted Fracture The Secret Enemy is an interesting story. It intertwines the real world with the paranormal in a way that is very believable. The story takes you on a hunt to rid the real world of the Couton, who have come from another world to devour this one. There are lots of elements to this adventure - romance, the complexities of combining two very different worlds and having to kill to save what you believe in. It kept my interest from the beginning and all the way through. It is part two of a series (Fracture) but can be read on its own. Well worth reading. A good paranormal romance, suspense, adventure. Congratulations and great job Virginia."}

{"text": "After completing my Sookie Stackhouse journey, I went in search of other books by Charlaine Harris. I decided that my next series would be the Harper Connelly mysteries. Like Sookie, Harper is a very unusual individual. But her personality is much darker and more tortured than the other heroine. Harper is the product of a dysfunctional home where both parents descended from an upper middle-income existence to a wasted life dominated by drugs and alcohol. Harper and her stepbrother, Tolliver, tried to hold the family together but eventually the authorities stepped in. Harper's life was completely changed after she survived a lightning strike as a young girl. This left her with a unique and ghoulish ability. Harper can find dead people. She is drawn to cadavers and, after she locates them, experiences their manner of death. Harper cannot communicate with the dead and she only knows how they died, not who was responsible. As an adult, she is able to make a living by helping people locate their missing and presumed dead family members. However, Harper cannot really function without the assistance of Tolliver. He understands her fears and insecurities and supports her in her work. Harper has, of course, a life-long terror of lightning and becomes catatonic in a thunderstorm. Also, it turns out that her unusual profession is a dangerous ones. Not everyone wants the dead to be found and some, in particular, do not want the manner of death to be disclosed. I enjoyed this book despite its dark tone and expect to pursue the rest of the series."}

The world of Wonderland had fallen flat in the first book and the character of Dinah had driven me mad with her constant whining and weakness. The same looked to be true for Blood of Wonderland, until Dinah runs into the Spade card and he takes her to the Yukerei where her true origins are revealed. Of course I didn't like her true origins. I think that part of the plot was ridiculous - but you can really just add it to the list - and I have a strange feeling that this character is seriously going to betray Dinah in the next book, but jeez.

{"text": "4.5 for this contemporary paranormal romance. \n This is the third book in a series and is best enjoyed by reading the previous books. \n Madison has been working on her powers, but no one in her coven was strong enough to save her younger brother from dying, so she sold her powers to Caden, a crossroad demon. Now she's his \"beck-and-call\" witch much to her dismay. And her boyfriend Isaac isn't wild about this arrangement either. Caden calls Madison at all times of day, particularly relishing in disrupting her plans with Isaac...so there's a LOT of friction. \n Caden's most recent tasks involve Madison helping him to collect the four pieces of a Binding chain which, when united, will allow the wearer to control the actions and powers of any being, even a supernatural one. It's too much power to trust int he hands of a demon, but Madison must comply with Caden's demands or risk him no holding up his end of the bargain---essentially causing her brother to die. \n Madison does seeks some help coping with her new \"job,\" mostly confiding in her BFF Kaylee who inadvertently raises the dead. Yep. Zombie. (Well, sorta....) Plus, it seems that Caden's big brother has some serious designs on the binding chain, or Madison, or both. \n I must admit, this book took directions I wasn't expecting. Madison, Isaac and their coven are determined to thwart Caden's attempt to unite the binding chain pieces, yet, in the process of working against Caden, Madison learns that Caden's motives aren't what she expected. No, he proves time and again that his behavior isn't that of a typical demon. That doesn't mean he's all good. He does take advantage of Madison's physical vulnerabilities on more than one occasion. Clearly, Caden would love to explore a more physical partnership, but he stops short whenever Madison puts him in check. That said, the love triangle here is really more tense than most YA romance--with reasons, but it's difficult nonetheless. \n For her part, Madison is keeping too many secrets, and all of them will drive a wedge between herself and Isaac--if he ever finds out. There's a lot of tension, mortal and emotional, with lots of bargaining and some re-drawing of Madison's agreement with Caden. The resolution is one fast ride to avoid eternal damnation. Without the trust developed between Madison and Caden there would be no happy. And, while this story ends clearly, the door is open to another book in this series. Yay!"}

{"text": "What really impressed me about this book was its creativity, its scope and its plausibility. It feels very authentic for a book about zombies. \n Written in oral history style, this a a true panorama with a large cast of characters that surveys how dozens of countries reacted to a multi-stage zombie infestation. Even from the vantage point of survivors reflecting back on personal experience, most of these vignettes are thrilling and moving. You'll read about large scale migrations north as survivors seek the comfort of freezing weather, dramatic military engagements, the breakdown of government and civil society as vigilante violence, illness and suicides ravage survivors, the secrets of the countries that weathered the apocalypse well (democracy is not necessary helpful to zombie fighting), and lots of other practical details. This is an ambitious and impressive work with some smart geopolitical and psychological commentary. The fates of many countries are discussed, with particularly memorable discussions of America, Canada, China, Russia, South Africa, Israel, Cuba, Japan, and North Korea. \n Minor nitpicks: I left this book without a clear sense of the timeline (i.e. when the Zombie War began and ended, how long each stage was) and how far after the conclusion of large scale hostilities World War Z takes place. There are parts that make it seem like it takes place many years in the future, but the presence of interview subjects who lived through World War II means that it can't be that far ahead. Also, while I understand its inclusion, there were a few points where the high level of detail about military equipment/maneuvers made my eyes glaze over."}

{"text": "I have been fond of Robin McKinley but her current style of breaking up sentences mid stream by using paranthesis and other ways to add an aside has gotten really annoying. \n While understandable in bad situations to be fatalistic and doubtful, the main character has it in spades. She still goes out to do all she can in the face of adversity but this fatalism does detract from the story line. Also created a discrepancy regarding her ability to bind the demesne fully since it can sense underlying emotions. Should not her doom and gloom have so infected the demesne that it would be impossible to succeed in her tasks (as noted in Chalice's musing that the land's response to the Master is colored by his emotions;) \n Cute fairy tale. Quick read."}
{"text": "I had high expectations for this book because I loved Hill's NOS4A2 and the movie adaptation was pretty awesome and it did not disappoint. This book is excellent from top to bottom. Hill jumps right into the premise with zero preamble and the first part of the book has a lot of great dark comedy as Ig compels twisted confessions out of people with his newly sprouted devil's horns. Over the course of narrative Hill uses flashbacks and multiple perspectives well to flesh out the characters and plot. Certain elements of the plot may initially seem a little far fetched but Hill creates a great, grounded bedrock for them in the relationship between Ig and Merrin. His chapters written from the perspective of Merrin's killer are also excellent at conveying a chilling portrait of evil. Awesome book."}

{"text": "This is probably the most divisive book in the Harry Potter series. People who dislike it cite it's length, lack of action, and the infamous angsty Harry. \n This is the first book where Harry feels like a real teenager. It dives deeper into the themes presented in book 3, showing Harry's anger and isolation, which makes him a much more compelling character than he is in previous books. And more often than not, I was just as angry as Harry was at certain events in this book. Plus, it has a villain far more entertaining than Voldemort (possibly more evil), and the first major loss Harry experiences. Yeah, it's like 900 pages, but Harry finally comes alive."}

{"text": "I purchased Wake awhile ago when the ebook was pretty cheap, I decided to finally read it. It wasn't anything great but still an ok read. I really thought Gemma and Alex's chemistry was good and Harper and Daniel were cute together too. I for some reason had a hard time getting through this book even though it was only 200 pages long. \n The ending was pretty interesting and left you wanting more. I just really hated the siren girls....Penn, Lexi and Thea. They had a very creepy way about them which we eventually find out why. I got the second book in this series for a bargain so I will be reading that soon."}
{"text": "See full review The Beauty of Darkness at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n Another book in this series where I am undecided. I liked how this book tied everything together. I liked how Lia redeemed herself not only to her own people, but with the Venda as well. I even liked how the love triangle was resolved. But, there were a few times during The Beauty of Darkness that I felt that Lia, Rafe, Kaden and the others were just...there. Sometimes their chapters felt more like placeholders then plot forwarding."}
{"text": "Iron Kissed is the third book in the Mercy Thompson series. And it really ramps up the story line. Our heroine is a mechanic who owns her own garage, a walker who can change into a coyote, a woman being courted by a werewolf, a person who can see and speak to ghosts, and someone whose friends also include vampires and several members of the fae. It is her relationship with this last group that powers this novel and it is a powerful story. Mercy's former boss and mentor, Zee, has been arrested and charged with a murder that he did not commit. His fellow fae seem willing to let him die to protect their group from police and public scrutiny. But Mercy is determined to find the guilty party. Even though Zee does everything he can to discourage her, Mercy persists with this dangerous mission. Patricia Briggs certainly pulled out all of the stops in this novel. It is violent and terrifying and sexual. Mercy not only has to face unfamiliar demons but also the ones within herself. This is a continuing story and I can't wait to read the next installment. Mercy Thompson is a heroine like no other (except maybe Sookie Stackhouse)."}

{"text": "This is a fun book! There's nothing dramatic in the plot, but it isn't formulaic, either, and the storytelling kept me focused on the characters instead of trying to guess the next plot twist so that I never had to feel jaded. Its real joy is in the human moments: the little pop culture asides that Corny and his family make, the times when Kaye and Corny very understandably have no idea what to do next, and most of all in the wonderful relationship between Kaye and her mother. Kaye seems to have gained a bit of maturity in her feelings toward Roiben between Tithe and this book -- which is not saying much, fortunately -- and it's nice to see her making new mistakes instead of the same ones over again!"}
{"text": "Facebook.com/TheBooknatics \n The Mind Readers is the first book in an Indie series, narrated in first person, and great for all YA readers of all ages. Cameron Winters is perfect heroine, who has the ability to read minds. In avoidance to expose Cameron's abilities and to not attract attention from a private investigation that's been hunting her kind for years, her grandmother moves them around constantly, causing Cam to never really have any friends. She was doing well in a small quiet town, till strange things began happening...A handsome boy just like her shows up in town and persuades her to come with him to a training facility for children owned by a wealthy man who instructs people just like them, to use their powers for good and protection. \n This novel flows at a mysterious, quick and thrilling pace, leaving the reader to believe one thing but then given a turn when least expected. This author is a brilliant! \n I would have loved to have built a relationship with certain few other characters that are mentioned and have important parts in the first novel; because I feel they are very promising in the rest of the series. And the ending was just astounding. I was predicting a cliffhanger in some way, but the cliffhanger we get, I am almost positive you won't see it coming either! \n My feelings on The Mind Readers: This book was cute and pleasing at the start. As the book went on, I became curious, the author tries to throw off the reader and make us reconsider who we're rooting for the entire book. Last two chapters...BOOM! *jaw drop* A bitter-sweet cliffhanger. \n Definitely not a cliche YA reader, what I appreciate about this novel too, is that it isn't just about the romance , barely at all. It focuses on a strong heroine who fights for good, and nothing else."}
{"text": "The novella had everything; despair, regret, pain, love, and redemption. The stories I like the most are those that take a very human story. A story of pain and relationships and then weave the paranormal into it perfectly. What I took away from this reading is that there is a fine line between good and evil. I think the characters walked that line flawlessly. \n Heaven was able to make the story delightfully funny in an evil way and yet sadly tragic at the same time. I thought it was well done, and it makes me able to say I look forward to whatever she writes next. I recommend this as an excellent and believable escape from reality."}

BUT, I did finish it and the more I thought about it, the more my struggle to finish felt a bit like Shadow's struggle to finish his job. And once it was over, it was worth it. Gaiman is a genius. He is able to put the reader through much of the same difficulties the main characters are experiencing, which makes the connection to the book that much better. I'm still thinking about Shadow, and have a list of gods and goddesses to research."}
{"text": "Ada beberapa hal yang saya suka dari #TheLunarChronicles. Seperti sebagian besar fans serial ini yang saya tahu, saya juga suka dengan fairy tale retelling di The Lunar Chronicles. Selain itu, saya juga suka dengan cerita yang plot-driven dengan perkembangan cerita dan perkembangan karakter yang well-written seperti ini. Serunya lagi, The Lunar Chronicles juga diisi dengan karakter-karakter perempuan yang tangguh -- bukan jenis karakter damsel in distress yang sedikit-sedikit harus diselamatkan oleh karakter laki-laki. \n Tapi, hal yang paling saya sukai dari serial ini adalah tokoh antagonis utama yang memiliki latar belakang kompleks dan perilaku yang juga kompleks. Jadi, bukan sekadar villain jahat yang melakukan kejahatan karena murni jahat. Melainkan karena dipengaruhi oleh kompleksitas karakter, perilaku, dan latar belakang yang memperkuat kemunculan perilaku tersebut. Menurut saya, kompleksitas karakter antagonis inilah yang menjadi daya tarik utama dari The Lunar Chronicles dan Marissa Meyer apik sekali dalam membuat karakter Levana Blackburn. Karakter Levana dibesarkan di dalam keluarga manipulatif, mengalami bullying oleh kakak sendiri ketika ia masih sangat kecil dan menyebabkan cacat permanen pada dirinya, serta selalu berada di bawah bayang-bayang kakak hingga ia remaja. Meskipun lebih mudah bagi kita mengatakan bahwa pada akhirnya setiap pilihan sikap dan perilaku itu adalah pilihan diri sendiri dan Levana punya pilihan untuk menjadi pribadi yang baik, bukannya memilih untuk menjadi jahat, tapi dengan latar belakang seperti itu sih saya lihat wajar jika Levana tumbuh menjadi pribadi yang kejam, haus kekuasaan, dan memiliki kepribadian yang kompleks. Luka di dalam hati dan jiwanya sudah terlalu mendalam, dan didikan keluarganya membuat pola pikir dia twisted."}

Sam sara sempre nel cuore di Caleana, ma adesso ho l'impressione che una parte di lui riviva nell'amore che Chaol prova per lei. \n Poesia e magia, orrore e superstizione, riti antichi ed enigmi da decifrare usati per creare il male al servizio di un regno corrotto. \n Il principe Dorian finalmente diventa un uomo coraggioso, e consapevole delle proprie responsabilita, e riesce a dare una nuova luce al suo personaggio. \n Stupendo il suo modo di tenere una parte di Caleana legata a lui. \n Nehmeria e gli altri personaggi tutti assolutamente credibili, e inseriti in maniera perfetta, per orchestrare una trama fitta e mai tediosa. \n Un libro che mi ha tenuta incollata ad ogni singola pagina, ora a sospirare per i miei due coccolini, adesso per la suspance che la Maas e riuscita a creare. Per poi fare a pezzettini minuscoli i miei feels, con le scelte di Chaol e le rivelazioni di Caleana... Il porto mi ha affondata completamente! \n Adesso vorrei gentilmente e senza pressioni, chiedere alla Mondadori di DARCI ORA, ADESSO E SUBITO, l'ultimo capitolo di questa saga spettacolare! \n Abbiate pieta di noi :("}

{"text": "I really enjoyed these. I have to admit that a huge part of the fun was that I got them in audio format, and Simon Jones was a perfect choice for the narrator. He makes a wonderful Bartimaeus. \n The third book was the weakest of the three; somewhat predictable and a bit of post-modernist propaganda. The second book's scene in the British Museum was priceless, however; anyone who has ever visited that august building will love it. \n Not always books for children, but definitely worthwhile for most older readers."}
{"text": "I wanted to like this so much more than I actually did. It felt like an imitation of the Grisha series except written by a high school freshman who self published. That might be a tad harsh but there were so many conflicting descriptions of characters (were the group of men old and not attractive or young and good looking??? We'll never know...). The MC was raised in seclusion by two people, yet her world knowledge is unrealistic given her background. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone because there are just so many more well done YA fantasy series out there."}

She grew up on the streets of Forge not knowing who her parents are and protected by her friend Flick who taught her the ways of a thief. But she's different than he is, she's limber, quick, and when she moves she doesn't make that much noise. She's the perfect canidate for a job that involves the Palace. But she can't find the item she is searching for and returns empty handed. The man who hired her - James - isn't disappointed that she couldn't find the item, if anything he is impressed that she was able to stay in the Palace so long without being caught. \n A few days later, he has a proposition for her. How would she like to make enough money where she wouldn't have to worry about keeping roof over her head, food in her stomach and enough left over for other things? She accepts the job working for the Assassin's Guild, but only as a thief and nothing more. But her job doesn't go as she plans... \n Tristam and his friend Jack are almost knights of the Palace's army. One day they're out on patrol when they go after a large cat that is attacking a farm's livestock. Tristam believes the attempt is stupid and watches in horror as his best friend is killed right before his eyes by a cat that isn't quite a normal cat. He vows to find these demon cats - or Demon Hunters that have been plaguing the countryside - and enlists into the Minster of Defense's service. But he is baffled by a string of thefts and the fact that the Demon Hunters have moved from the outskirts of the countryside into the city."}

{"text": "Thread Slivers by Leeland Artra \n This is one of those books I had many mixed feelings about. I liked the main characters Ticca and Lebuin. There's clearly a lot of detail that went into the world-building, but it was too much of a good thing. It was, as if to make up for the other characters being uninteresting or to introduce the 'epic' part of epic fantasy earlier in the story, Artra added 800 POVs to this story. They're all unnecessary. Finding a way to introduce plot elements while maintaining the focus completely on Ticca and Lebuin would've improved the pacing of this story, even if it would've made it shorter. I skimmed through everything else because the level I cared was 'meh'. \n When you manage to make a giant, immortal wolf general boring, your story has a problem. \n There is initially a lot to like about Thread Slivers. Ticca is a Dagger, a warrior for hire, and she is tasked with solving the mystery of who killed a powerful mage while protecting another mage, Lebuin, from the Knives that want to murder him, too. Lebuin thinks another mage, Magnus Cune, at the guild wants him murdered, which is a fairly safe assumption seeing how the two act together. It becomes clear that there's something more--much more--going on around these two, and it was a fine little mystery as to what that plot was. There's a hint of time travel and some sci-fi/fantasy blending, which is a theme that I've read in other books and like a lot. This plot is clearly being saved for later, and it feels like a lot of interesting plot elements are being saved for later. And not in a good way, either. \n But when we do get answers, they kind of suck. This isn't because the plot wasn't cool (time travel! immortal warlords! lost magic! special bloodlines!) but because we find out all of these things from characters that have never met the main characters or have only met the main characters tangentially. These characters all revolves around Duke, and he monopolizes like a third of this story and made every moment suck because he's conceptually awesome without doing anything for emotional aspects of this story. He has no POV chapters himself, but all of these boring characters that interact with him get special chapters. This is the real problem in this story--all the major plot twists are doled out several chapters before the main characters even get a hint of what they are. Ticca and Lebuin feel like footnotes in what should be their own story. \n When we do get back to Ticca and Lebuin, who are journeying to collect the mage's things in hopes of finding clues to his death, we're treated to the most annoying character in the novel--Klaisa. She sucks. She's bland, and she appears in Lebuin and Ticca's dreams to info dump. She tells them things we've already known for some time, and if her appearance weren't supposed to be This Big Thing at the end, maybe I could've tolerated her. But I couldn't. She was The Worst. She was the final distraction in a novel that unraveled from a strong first half. \n And cliffhangers only work if you care about the ending. \n Rating: 3 stars and only because I liked Lebuin, Ticca, and the details around those characters."}
{"text": "I loved the first book so much that going into this second book I had such high high hopes. Well, as fate may have it high hopes only lead to disappointment. That's not to say this book wasn't good because it was good, it just wasn't AS GOOD as the first book. \n Here's why - \n I felt the conversations between characters were 10 times more witty and funny in the first book than in this book. There just seemed to be something missing, in particular between the two main characters. \n The entire plot line was sorta of a vessel to move readers between book 1 and 3. While there was a plot element that drew the story together, I just felt it was a bit lacking. I can't really describe why but it just felt so..... there for the sake of being there. \n The last part, which I shouldn't spoil it for anyone. I did not like the ending. I'm not sure why every single character in this case is acting so dumb. They are so dumb it's almost out of character and frustrating."}
{"text": "\"No one who has been accused has ever been found innocent. No one who has been accused has ever lived to see their family and homes again. No one who has been accused has ever seen anything besides the bars of the prison chamber until they hung on the hill.\" \n When the Black Roses Grow by Angela Archer is a romantic historical fiction novel with a hint of the paranormal set during the time of the Salem witch trials. \n From the start, the reader is aware of the injustices plaguing Salem, particularly with the regards to the trials persecuting so-called witches. \n I liked how the author kept me wondering if the book has actual paranormal events till the end. \n \"Suddenly, another stem sprouted before my eyes. In contrast, my limbs grew numb... My mind whirled, lost in a sea of unexplainable reasons and sheer terror, while the green vine curled through the air, and the leaves bounced and waved. Shadows closed in, hunting as they preyed on the pain pulsing through the deepest fears of my mind.\" \n Emmalynn Hawthorne, the protagonist, is a rebellious character, for a woman during at the time. She often speaks before she thinks, although there are many other times in which she does her best not to retort. As a character, Emmalynn is quite relatable. Her struggle with sin versus love and desire is real, strong and down to earth. \n \"I care not for the judgements of anyone in Salem.\" \n The sheriff later discovers that Emmalynn is both smart and has this rebellious side. \n There is also the mysterious character of Mr. Dekane, whom Emmalynn secretly admires, and whom we meet bit by bit but cannot understand his true intentions. \n \"Contrary to what other men think, Emmalynn, I do not believe that women are the Devil's instruments. I believe they are wonderful creatures that should not be provided for but cared for.\" \n I appreciate Archer's attempted use of archaic language such 'thee', 'thou', 'thine', to accentuate the historical feel of her fiction. However, there were a lot of inconsistencies throughout the novel, which irritated me. There were also many times that I felt the language is modern but with an archaic word or two wedged in here and there that just did not work out for me. \n One of the lines that I just couldn't imagine being said at that period - around 1692 - is \"Hath a seat.\" It's modern with an old use for \"have\". \n There were many beautiful lines, quotes and images throughout the novel. Here's a reflection by Emmalynn: \n \"One can only be strong before strife consumes, breaking the ties that bind them and keep them tucked away from all around. My strength wavered every day, but today felt different. Today, the pain overwhelmed me more with the ever-present conflict of casting the facade that nothing perturbed me. That I lived a happy life in a town I loathed. That I did not wake every morning with the gut-wrenching feeling of loneliness.\" \n At the beginning of the novel we are introduced to two strangers whose skin is very white. The warning: \"Beware of the white colourless people for they are the devil and will devour thy soul\" is reminiscent of an old wives' tales. \n Emmalynn is fairly well-developed character; still, there was some character development towards the end. Despite the significant amount of sobbing, she becomes aware that to look weak, makes the sheriff and the deacons even more vile. \"I would not allow them to drag me to my death. I would walk to it.\" \n Another thing I liked in the book is the author's ability to show through speech. \n Overall, When the Black Roses Grow would have received a 4.75-to-5-star review from me if it weren't for the attempted use or rather misuse of archaic language. Still, it is highly recommended. \n So the overall rating is: 3.5 stars. \n Note: I received a free copy of When the Black Roses Grow from the author in exchange for an honest review."}
{"text": "Twice Upon a Time by Hope Irving is the first instalment in the Black Angel Book series. It is the story of the witch Deidre, who, being in love with the calligrapher monk Morgann, casts a spell to reunite their souls in the future. However, while Morgann's hosts remember everything, Deidre's do not. \n We later learn that the tale of Deidre and Morgann is believed to be legend, especially amongst calligraphers. \n The opening chapter though informative is narrated in a casual manner, not from a once-upon-a-time monk; it wasn't light either. Afterwards, the narration shifts between Rose and the man carrying Morgann's time-travelling soul. \n I liked how Hope Irving kept the second narrator's identity a mystery (obviously I'm doing the same). \n The idea that Morgann's current form may or may not appeal to Rose or Deidre is interesting and leaves room for possible problems. \n \"Somehow my soul remembers it all, hers doesn't. \n But how will she remember who she was, who we were? \n Will seeing me be enough? \n Will I need to trigger her memory? \n Will she accept me as I am now?\" \n Twice Upon a Time sets the backdrop for the upcoming books in the series. There is a lot of action, although not much with regards to bringing Deidre's and Morgann's souls back together. \n Rose is an ordinary girl, whose heart has been badly broken in previous relationship. Here, she comes to spend the summer with her American side of the family. She deeply seeks to get her mind off the previous relationship and the man who broke her, G. \n Rose is also a cutter and I particularly liked how Irving maintained this trait throughout the novel, even when Rose was happy, giving a realistic side to a paranormal story. \n \"Gifted Deirdre cast the spell that enabled our souls to eventually be reunited. She couldn't bear for us to be apart, and neither could I.\" \n I did not enjoy the too much drinking part of the novel; I felt it was overdone. But that's just me. \n Having been in the search for Deirdre's soul for-ever, Morgann or his host seems unable to comprehend that he may have found her, putting him off balance, and making him think irrationally. I liked that. Although, I felt sometimes he was way too irrational (but that's the norm in relationships now, especially when you make assumptions). \n Getting viewpoints of the two protagonists allows the reader to guess at events and see beyond what is going. There were parts when I was biting my nails with worry and others when I was telling off the characters or just going on \"No. No. Nooooo!\" (So you can probably say it's a bit of an interactive novel.) \n \"She had faith in me, so I have no choice but to have faith in me, too.\" \n Twice Upon a Time is filled with active, fun, interesting and recurring characters, giving the novel a realistic side. The group barely sleeps; however, they do give Rose a breather, allowing her to get her mind off G. often. \n Falling under the romance and new adult genres, the novel includes more than just kissing. In addition, Rose's desires are awakened all of sudden and need to be satiated. \n \"There is no way to find a logical way to deal with this when logic isn't involved.\" \n There isn't major character development for the two protagonists, however, this is expected considering the tale will continue in other parts and hasn't seen major progress in this book. Although Rose does develop a bit, at least she figures out what she wants and that she can't wait for her crush to grow up or take a decision, Morgann's host seems to require several hard slaps on the face to wake him up. \n Although there aren't many profound images in the novel, Twice Upon a Time has many beautiful quotes. I also liked the idea of calligraphy and how it connects the characters together, including Rose and her new crush. The following bit will you give you an idea on what I mean. \n \"To make it work, I have to focus like I do in calligraphy with the ductus; its' the same mechanism: one step at a time in a specific order. I have to remember to breathe. To ensure the fairytale ends well, I will stand by her side until she trusts me and she's ready for me. At last.\" \n I liked that the ending to Twice Upon a Time was different from what I expected. \n Note: I received a free copy of Twice Upon a Time from author Hope Irving in exchange for an honest review. I look forward to reading the next part(s) in the series, which I've been told are likely to be published in 2016."}

{"text": "The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of my favorite Halloween and Christmas movie, and I am sure that many have seen it. I love the plot and the songs, and how dark it is. When I saw the manga on NetGalley, I had to take my chance and requested the book for myself. \n Well, the manga is far more shorter than the movie. A very condensed version if I may add. I can understand why someone would buy this manga and put it in their bookshelf, but would I buy it? No, I rather buy the movie. At the same time, I knew what I was getting myself into, but I wanted to be slightly more positive. Folks, just stick to the movie and avoid this one. I read it in under twenty minutes and the animation was okay."}

{"text": "For some odd reason, I'v been having a sort of.. craving for Faerie-related/themed book. So I found this book on one of the threads created on Goodreads. I was immediately intrigued because of the perfect summary and not to mention the amazing cover! I don't know why, but I love this cover!! Then after I thought, wow, let me check who wrote this.. thats basically when I knew this book was probably amazing! If you don't know yet, Maggie Stiefvater is an amazing writer! Many can agree while many can disagree but to me, she most defiantly is :) You might know her from her amazing series, The Wolves of Mercy Falls, or even The Raven Cycle. ANYWAYS, this book did not disappoint me! At first, I was thinking, hmm maybe I have too much high expectations for this one, but of course, I was wrong! My ideal faerie book would be, Julie Kagawa's series, The Iron Fey. So of course, I expected this book to be just as good. Now, while Lament: The Faerie Queen's Deception being a great book, it was not as god as The Iron Fey. But that was no surprise really. \n This book starts off with a 16 year old girl named Deirdre Monaghan. I actually felt so bad for her because of that name (NO OFFENCE TO SOMEONE WHO DOES!) its just a mouthful, and thats why people call her Dee. Being a musician, she is extremely talented in both the harp and vocals. You'll find out why in the book. As she's in the girls bathroom she meets a boy (referred to looking as old as a senior) named Luke Dillon, but she already knew who he was from her dreams. At first this was all weird for me to read because of the circumstances: a girl meets an older boy in the girls bathroom, holding her hair as she vomits. Then instantly knows him because he has occurred in her dreams?????? Pretty weird .. at least to me.. But once you get further into the book, it starts to finally make sense. I'v read this in a day and I cant express how much you should all read this :) If you like romantic faerie themed books, then go ahead and read this one!"}
{"text": "Amazing. I cannot believe it took me this long to find Miss Scarlett Thomas, but I am hereby a devout follower.

This book begs to be discussed at length over many cups of coffee."}

{"text": "I'm gonna try hard not to spoiler-ize. \n I loved it. The end. \n Just kidding! There's so much happening in the space of the few days that the books spans. but, to sum up: \n Charley is in a delicate condition, for the first time in her life. She's being hunted by twelve hounds from Hell, and seemingly attacked by them, yet escapes twice with barely any injuries. Meanwhile, Reyes and his Deava compatriot, Osh, are brutalized. For me, it seems there's a missing link; everybody THINKS the beasts are out to kill Charley, but I expect we will learn the opposite is true. In the effort to defend against the twelve beasts, Charley embraces even more awesome powers, leading Reyes to believe that Charley's supernaturalness isn't limited to reaping. \n Turns out that, in addition to being the light of Reyes life, Charley is part God. And her freaktastic ability to heal the gravely injured was not a fluke. \n And, Charley's getting to be more than a bit jealous of Reyes and the way women swoon for him. (I'd like to apologize for all the gawking, Charley, really, but you know he's too sexy for just one glance...) At the heart of this book is a semi-psycho TV reporter who dogs Reyes at every turn. Reyes, naturally, wants nothing of this attention, and is too wrapped up trying to figure out how to keep Charley safe to form the best anti-stalker strategy. \n There was a cold case, five unsolved murders, that Charley solves in the first scene, which seemed to set the stage for further drama--but that was superseded by the current unsolved mystery: four seemingly unrelated people have written similar suicide notes and then disappeared, leaving no bodies. And, unfortunately, when their connections are made, well, it lands Reyes back to the police precinct for questioning. Not good. Especially as Reyes and Charley come across a credible prediction that Charley's due to die, and soon. \n That's all I'm gonna say, except that this book ends with as much of an HEA as any of the others do. And, Reyes is totally gone over Charley, and I'm totally gone over Reyes, which makes for an uncomfortable love triangle, but I'm willing to suffer for at least seven or eight more books."}
{"text": "This would really be a 2.5. This novel was definitely interesting and I did enjoy it overall, but there were times I thought the story was a little slow. Delaney falls through the ice and is in a coma for 6 days. Everyone thought she was dead so they are overjoyed that she miraculously recovers. However now, Delaney is able to sense when others are going to die and she doesn't know what to do with this new power. \n It was definitely an interesting concept and would be good for middle school or high school readers. However, like I said, as an adult reading the story, there were parts I didn't understand and that were slow to get through."}

{"text": "I always say Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is my favorite Harry Potter book, but in fact, the last four books are all my favorites. The red thread (is that even a saying in English, or am I just translating this Dutch phrase too literally?) of the entire series and the way Rowling thought ahead comes through greatly, the characters are developed deeply and beautifully and the entire atmosphere is just much more grim and intense; just the way I like it. \n The sixth book, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, reintroduces Harry's stubbornness, in the form of his addiction to the book of the Half-Blood Prince. In addition, his obsession with his parents comes to the surface again; in book three he already thought his father conjured a Patronus to save him (which actually was his own Patronus), now he is convinced the mysterious book is written by the young James. I really liked the peek into \"the real world\"; this book starts with the prime minister of the British Muggles, being informed about the terrifying situation in the wizard world, which is now also influencing the Muggle world. You are reminded that in fact, there is no such thing as \"two worlds\"; everything that happens in either communities, also influences the others. \n Lastly, obviously, the ending was intense. But again, a great built-up to the final ending of the entire series. I always love rereading the scene on the Astronomy Tower, now knowing what \"really\" goes on there. \n \"And now, Harry, let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.\" \n ~ Albus Dumbledore"}
{"text": "Anger's Children by K. D. Rose is collection of three short stories. Judging this book or writing its review is particularly hard, since I hated one of the stories, loved another and one remained in between like and dislike. \n I must note, however, that the synopses for the stories were more interesting than most of the stories themselves. Sex is the focus of the stories; some of it was more disgusting than enjoyable. \n The stories are not related and can be read in any order. In the first part or story, titled \"Under the Shadow of Wings\", I did not enjoy the narration one bit. It felt like bits and pieces were scattered and there was no fixed timeline. Also, there was a mention of mighty sword at the beginning but it was never referred to again, which was strange. There was also a transfer of power but there was no rising tension to meet this power surge. \n In addition, contradictory tones in some parts, including \"She had already won. She had just come back to collect.\" It's like winning and collecting - we don't know what exactly, probably souls, except that they belong to her and \"all her dead relatives\" - are being justified. \n The story quickly shifts to impossible sex in an airplane restroom, which is tiny for one person, let alone two with one of them having wings! I also found the ideas she thinks are from her dead relatives rather confusing. \n \"Under the Shadow of Wings\" was an overall weird story and I really disliked it. It was the opening story and seriously put me off the rest of the book for a bit. \n The second story titled \"Eyes Only\" is considerably long compared to the first and last ones and makes up the bulk of the book. It is also the most enjoyable of the three. \n It is a story within a story within a story with a spectacular twist at the end, making it far more complex than the other two. \n With also a lot of sex, \"Eyes Only\" is bursting with suspense. It boasts several bits of imagery, including: \"Like a junkie, my addiction to her had galloped out of control.\" \n \"Eyes Only\" was not free of confusion, however. Still it is mostly enjoyable and interesting. \n The third and final story in Anger's Children is \"The Dark Man\" \n \"You remain a poignant gossamer of idealistic dreams instead of a champion of organised power - an actual force to be reckoned with.\" - these words echo at the end of the story as well, resulting in an unexpected and intriguing ending. \n As a reader, I wanted to know who the characters were. Are they gods? Or are they pawn in a game for the gods? \n Even though the characters have names, we don't know anything about them, except that they have met - and had sex - several times before and that they have been around for centuries. \n I also felt the storyline and timeline were quite vague. \n Overall rating: Again hard to judge but 2-2.5 stars. \n Note: I received a free copy via Xpresso Book Tours in exchange for an honest review."}
{"text": "Another fun title. I had to write and tell you all that chapter 3 deals with the Littles making a telephone call. This is hilarious. Partly because of the setting of the story, but mostly because my little reader has no experience with a telephone or how it works. I had quite the time trying to explain it! Nonetheless, he did understand flying and the other accomplishments of the Littles in the book. The story features a snow storm and the birth of a baby, so it is interesting to both boys and girls. \n But if you want to save yourself the hilarity, or maybe frustration, of explaining an old fashioned telephone and helping your reader through the intricacies of a machine he doesn't understand, you might want to chose another one of the excellent titles in this series! :)"}
{"text": "I read this book when I was 15. And I remember not knowing much about it and it took me forever to pick it up and read. At that age I LOVED the story....It made me laugh and I related to the character. I read the book in a sitting. I am now 21 and I just don't get the same things out of it that I did back then. I still think that it's great that Stephenie Meyer wasn't afraid to make vampire's so different for what we all know. Alot of people hate this I mean yeah the sparkling thing is kinda weird but to make them good. And I think that us women are drawn to the bad boy who we think we can fix so she really is that far off. It's still an ok read. Just not one of my favorites."}

{"text": "These books are all right. The characters are decent and the plots are well-constructed. It took me until the end of the second book to put my finger on what it was about the writing style that bothered me. \n The author's tone is a trifle smug for my tastes. He thinks he is slightly cleverer than he actually is, and very few of his \"surprise plot twists\" are actually surprising, unless they are so convoluted that no one could possibly guess them. \n This one leaves one plot thread hanging that I am willing to bet will come up somewhere again in the series, but I'm not sure I feel like reading on to find out."}
{"text": "Steve certainly has stepped outside of the realm of children's fiction with the introduction of his adult book Graynelore. It is reminiscent of the Icelandic sagas in the gritty descriptions of battles waged and the cold manner in which reivers approach their life and calling to war with their neighbors at the behest of their lord. There is a dreamlike quality to the telling of the tale and I was reminded in parts of the ancient ballads of England. The ballad of Tristan and Isolde in fact came to mind in one part as I read. Ill-fated lovers who were never meant to be because of the wish and whim of a lusty lord. This book is not for the weak minded because it makes you think. It keeps you on your toes to follow what is happening in the thoughts and remembrances of Rodrig. It is very much like a dream. Wistful and drifting. This is his memoir of sorts so the organization fits what one might expect from a man looking back over his life. This book is not for the weak stomached for there are parts that drip with gory detail of a warrior that might sour a lunch or two. The kicking around of a severed head at one point was one of the more unsettling parts. The language is at times riddled with colorful metaphors but given the atmosphere of the story, it seems to fit the prose. Over all, this book left me speechless."}
{"text": "The Cinderella story told \"E True Hollywood Story\" style from the POV of the stepsister. Since this is an alternate story, it didn't surprise me to find that the ugly stepsister was actually very beautiful on the inside unlike dear Cinderella. This story speaks heavily of beauty, just like Wicked, and provoked some profound thinking. It's essentially a study of beauty- inside and out- and it's implications. \n \"In the lives of children, pumpkins can turn into coaches, mice and rats into human beings. When we grow up, we learn that it's far more common for human beings to turn into rats.\" Poor kids, the transition from ignorance to knowing that real monsters are human is a terrible one. \n \"Damn the human stomach, this fat betrayer of my ideals.\" he he he"}
{"text": "I just finished reading Here ( On The Otherside) and all in all, I am glad I did. I have a few complaints which I will share in a moment, however first I want to make it abundantly clear that all in all this book leans toward the positive side of the scale. I liked it enough that I will probably snag the sequel when it comes out. \n What I disliked: I found several ( atleast four or five) typos - little things like two periods, backwards quotation marks, etc as well as a few inconsistent issues - again small things. One of our characters was described in memory as having laughed at our main character, clinging onto the sidelines wanting to be a part of things - i didn't really feel like her best friend would have said that. At another point she tells a teacher she will stop by and see the school counselor, while internally saying she has no intentions of going. Suddenly the next morning she goes immediately to the counselors office? A good round of editing honestly should have caught these mistakes, but they were small enough that while they distracted me enough to be annoyed, I could keep going and ultimately i was glad that I did. \n Speaking only to the first half of the book I felt that plot points that were dropped often felt forced and didn't flow as well as they could have. She freaks out that Evan is actually looking at her, but by everything that had been described so far shes a bit of a spectacle at the school so while I understood where and why the author was going with the tidbit, it didn't feel natural. I think it would have made more sense if he'd been looking at her in a way that suggested he wanted to talk to her, which understandably would have confused her. \n What I did like: Everything else not listed above. The second half of the book was a giant improvement over the first half as far as plot went. Where before it had felt forced here it felt just right. The pacing overall was great, the first half set us up to know and like the characters and want to see them succeed, and i did. The second half was a whirlwind of a good ride. The author definitely nailed the art of pacing a good story and making us want to continue reading dead on. At no point did I want to give up on the book, even though during the first half I really wasn't entirely loving it. \n I also need to touch on the cover. While i love the breathtaking cover I am not sure that it totally fits the book. If i could have, I would have given this book 3 1/2 stars. With a solid edit and a bit of tightening up the first half to be as well written and as captivating as the second half it could easily be 4 1/2. \n In conclusion, pick up this book, keep with it through the first half and enjoy the rest of the ride."}
{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n I didn't want to like this book. It was written in the eighties and reminded me of the cliches that existed at the time. The world was going to end in nuclear disaster and the general population wouldn't even be aware of the difficulties that existed. Men were the destroyers of the world and women were the creators. It combined religion and The Wasteland which is a bit overdone in literature. The evil friend was obviously the devil and death. I'm not sure I think of death as evil personified.Radiation sickness is an accumulative disease and so are the after effects. It seemed as if most of those that were left alive were not the brightest but instead just wandered looking for something better, what happened to the engineers and the organizers? There was stereotypical evil and the reluctant heroine. For all of these reasons I didn't want to like Swan Song, but I do like it. The characters showed much of true humanity. Despite extraordinary circumstances, people were still people. They gave speeches that made you want to route for them. Their philosophies were simple, just one more day, just one more step. I think that we all want to believe that the thing that can't be killed is hope. I felt a little deceived by the numbers of good versus evil. Humanity wants to cheer for the underdog but I feel that more people should have been on the good side. I know this seems overthought out, but it is because when I thought about it I thought of all of the things wrong, but I would then bury my head back in the book and enjoy getting lost in the story."}

{"text": "Short review: I liked it and would suggest it to scifi/fantasy/wizard fans who want a quick entertaining read to pass the time. \n Long Review: \n What if Harry Potter went to college? Well this book answers that question. There is a young wizard who is raised as an orphan, a secret wizards school, a dorky best friend, a brainy girl, a weird nutty girl, a whole society hidden from humans, a hidden wizard town with a great pub, magical classes, wizards who are prejudice against humans, humans that are prejudice against wizards, a special name for non-magical folks, and a mysterious group of wizards with the goal of fighting humans. Sound familiar? \n This is a good start from a beginning author and a good first book for fledgling series. Well, it does play out as a rehashing of previous tales, if you are not looking for a great work of literary briliance and just looking for a fun read then this book is for you. The plotline is a little predictable, but it is a interesting and fun take on the wizarding world. I did like that the author went into detail about how magic works in the books, how spells are created, and decided not to make wands the primary source of magic. I think if the author build on and highlighed the myth and lore, as well as gave more information about the wizarding world/human world (past and present) it would definately add a lot to the story. With the discription of how the magic works and spells are created I could see a game being created, if all this was built upon. I also liked the part about bonding with animals. There are also a few decent action scenes. I believe the mood was supposed to be dark (and at times it could be e.g. when a wizard/human is murdered), but this seemed like a more young adult/older children geared book, so it wasn't too unsettling or graphic. The pace of the book was pretty steady, it did drag at times, but overall was a quick read. The characters were not one dimentional, but were not fully developed. I would classify them as developing. I think that overall the one thing to remember is that this is the first book in a series, so the characters, world, and backstory are still developing and hopefully will grow more as the series goes on. I would read the other books in the series. I like this book and would recomend it to people who like scifi/fantasy/wizard books, and wants a quick entertaining read. I have not read any of the other books, so I don't know how this book is in relation to the others, so my opinion may change as the series goes on and more connections are made."}
{"text": "This book was an enjoyable, quick read. I see it described here as a young adult book, but I would describe it as a children's book, or at least the younger end of the young adult category. I had gathered from the blurb that it was probably going to be aimed at the younger generations, so that didn't bother me. \n I think this would be a great book for kids who are mature for their years to read. It has some really dark themes - like the fact that the book starts off with a triple homicide - but it covers them in a non-threatening, whimsical sort of way."}

{"text": "Charlaine Harris is going on my blacklist. This list includes authors whose books I will not read and will not even consider reading after sitting through exactly one book by them and finding that it was one too many. The other people on that list, whose very names make me shudder, include Jodi Picoult and Tony Parsons. \n Having said that, I can see, even if I do not comprehend, the appeal of \"Dead Until Dark\" - really, what's not to like? There's a young attractive heroine, a dark handsome stranger, and the mystery of a series of unnatural deaths. To cap it off, it's about vampires, which fulfills our fascination with both sex and death. Yet Harris doesn't quite manage to pull it off. \n The plot is slow and holds no surprises. Although Sookie Stackhouse is proffered as a likable lead, she plays straight into stupid and shallow. The on-off relationship between Sookie and vampire Bill is dragged out for three-quarters of the book and the potential meat of the story, the murders, are relatively unexamined. There is an attempt to inject humour into the story which succeeds perhaps in the first few chapters and then rapidly descends into banality. \n For a fun blend of angst and bloodlust and humour, I'll be sticking with reruns of Buffy."}

{"text": "This novel was part of a group read in my Goodreads group. I was provided with a free copy for this review. \n I would like to start off by saying that this was a wonderfully written fairy tale! Although I'm not familiar with the original that Thorn is based on (The Goose Girl), I found it had all the elements required for a great tale. I was especially happy with ending because it was not your typical \"Happy Ending\".. Things do turn out well in the end but it was far from the perfect princess marries the prince ending and I really liked that. I have nothing against fairy tales, but things rarely turn out the way you want them to. \n Thorn follows the story of a young princess named Alyrra who has grown up in an unhappy home. Abused by her brother and ignored by her mother, Alyrra's only solace is her horseback riding and her friend, the Wind. She soon finds herself betrothed to a prince from a far off country that she has never met and has heard even worse things about. She has no choice but to accept and she leaves home on a long journey towards her new husband. During the trip she is attacked and magically switches bodies with her hand maiden. Unable to tell anyone what has happened, she arrives in her husband's kingdom not as a princess but as a common servant. It is in this new life that she must decide to live as a common peasant, something she desperately desires, or to face her fears and fight for what is rightfully hers. \n There were times when I really didn't know what to think of Alyrra. I understood the pain and the fear that comes from being abused, but sometimes I wished I could have just shaken her and told her to suck it up. I also really enjoyed the prince's character. He strong and compassionate, but he had flaws too. \n I would recommend this book to anyone who loves fairy tales. It was well written and it flowed very quickly and effortlessly. Thank you for letting me read such a great novel and I hope we see more from Intisar soon."}
{"text": "I laughed out loud at so many parts of this book. I was skeptical about this one since I'm not really into steampunk as a genre, but the ridiculous premise of this book made me so curious that I had to give it a shot. I was hooked from the very first scene and through to the end. Sophronia is such a strong female character with a terrible future ahead of her as a lady in mid-nineteenth century England. She is terrible at being a debutante and was embarrassing to her family. Being sent off to a finishing school was her good fortune since it turned out to be a weird school indeed. The entrance interview includes: \n \"And have you killed anyone recently? ... a knife to the neck, or perhaps a cleverly noosed cravat?\" \n The proper courses for young ladies were present but mixed in with some very questionable courses on concealing weapons, fighting werewolves, and poisons. I loved watching Sophronia learn about a whole new aspect of the world and even though this book didn't even touch on the darker aspects of the training, I'm sure that will come up and cause her to have some ethical issues later. I will definitely be finishing this series. \n Sophronia's greatest skill (besides her observational and logical) is bringing together people of all kinds in her team. She befriends the 'sooties' who work in the boiler room and the outcasts in her class and they all will do whatever they can for her. They do so because they know she would do the same for them. That is a lovely quality. \n We simply cannot shoot first; it isn't done. Now, remember that, Miss Temminnick, do--a lady never shoots first. She asks questions, then she shoots. \n We are going to try to address first the best and most deadly application of wooden stakes, hatpins, and hair sticks. If we have time, I will move us on to how to properly judge a gentleman by the color and knot of his cravat. Believe you me, ladies, the two subjects are far more intimately entangled than you might first suppose. \n Algebra was far more interesting when it was a matter of proportioning out mutton chops so as to poison only half of one's dinner guests and then determining the relative value of purchasing a more expensive, yet more effective, antidote over a home remedy. \n ...it's no good choosing your first husband from a school for evil geniuses. Much too difficult to kill. \n While preparing for an evening at the theater: \n Much easier, he explained, to kill someone with a garrote at a seated event; only make certain you sit directly behind your quarry. \"Very inconvenient,\" he said, \"to try to kill someone when you are seated in front of him.\" \n ...he was looking quite at ease with the world, in the manner of most chronically ill-behaved children. \n Her expression was that of a woman with multiple children who was no longer surprised by anything they did..."}

{"text": "This series had a lot of potential and ended up disappointing me in the end. \n WHAT I LIKED: \n -I continued to enjoy the comedic relief that is Xemerius. \n -I still didn't see a lot of the twists coming. But.. having said that.. see below. \n WHAT I DISLIKED: \n -Although I didn't see a lot of the twists coming, I still didn't really enjoy them. Spoilers: Mr Whitman was the count? And that was revealed in the last 5 pages and then he was defeated?! What?? Also, Gideon taking the immortality elixir. Great. Yeah. You guys have known each other for a total of 2 weeks and now you are going to spend eternity together. Awesome. And the weird epilogue about Gwen's either little brother or nephew being Mr. Bernard the housekeeper?? What? Why? Why was that even a thing? How does that make sense? \n -NOTHING WAS EXPLAINED! There were prophecies throughout these books. Prophesies made by who? Never explained. How the chronograph works? Also not really explained. Why Gwen can see and talk to ghosts? Not explained. Why the count had powers? Not explained. I thought that the other time travelers would also have powers, but since they didn't I think those things should have been explained. They were just thrown in there for no reason! And then her immortality to top it all off! So many things about the story and background were not explained that I can't even name them all. \n -The romance. Complete insta-love. It made no sense and was unbelievable. They've known each other 2 weeks! And 12 of those days, Gideon was a dick to her. What? \n -The side characters were all just tropes. Evil aunt. Evil perfectionist cousin. Uptight grandma. Cool spunky best friend. They were fun in the first books but just got old at the end. \n -The way it was wrapped up was too sudden. Even though I was over the story and wanted it to be over, they defeated the count in 5 minutes and then there was no talk about what happened with the Guardians after that. I highly doubt they just go on living their lives. \n -We find out about Lucy and Paul being her parents in the first book, and it isn't resolved until the very end of this book. And even then, it's barely discussed between the characters involved and we see hardly any interactions. WHAT? \n Overall, I was expecting more from the story than what I was given. By the time I got to this book, I was really over most of the characters and the situations. It felt too drawn out. It would have been better as a duology."}
{"text": "\"For nothing is evil in the beginning.\" \n I absolutely loved the LOTR-movies, I read The Hobbit last year and I'm currently really into Fantasy books - so how could I not start the Lord of the Rings-trilogy by Tolkien? As you may have read in my review of The Hobbit, I felt that one was a bit too light-hearted (don't get me wrong; I loved it, but the mystery and darkness surrounding the LOTR is exactly what I love most). \n 'Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky, \n Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone, \n Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die, \n One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne \n In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie. \n One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, \n One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them \n In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.\" \n The first chapters of The Fellowship of the Ring feel very much like The Hobbit; lighthearted and very detailed. You get a lot of information about the life of hobbits, which may seem as useless information, but is very entertaining and great way to slide into the story. The hints of what is to come (Gandalf confronting Bilbo and the lines written on the One Ring) prepare you for the epic story. Same goes for this entire book actually, in comparison to The Two Towers and The Return of the King; the emphasis is mostly on the \"adventure\" of the fellowship and the beautiful places they see (Hobbiton, Rivendell, Lothlorien). There are a few dark moments, which are epic, but it is not as depressive or intense as the other two yet. Also, Tom Bombadil! What a character! I loved him. Such a shame he wasn't mentioned in the movies, although I can understand they had to cut something. \n \"I wish it need not have happened in my time,' said Frodo. 'So do I,' said Gandalf, 'and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.\" \n But the dark moments that did happen, were as I mentioned, very epic. One of the moments was the attack of the Nine, including the Pale King, on Weathertop on Frodo. Not only the attack, but the flight afterwards, in which Frodo is rescued by Glorfindel (and not Arwin, as in the movies) and the flood created by Elrond and Gandalf, was quite intriguing. \n \"Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement.\" - Gandalf \n But even more so I loved the dark moment in the Mines of Moria. In The Chamber of Records they find a book containing a record of the fortunes of Balin's folk, ending with smeared lines barely readable, suggesting their end was cruel; \"We cannot get out. We cannot get out. They have taken the Bridge and second hall. Frar and Loni and Nali fell there. The Watcher in the Water took Oin. We cannot get out. The end comes. Drums, drums in the deep. They are coming.\" Not to enjoy their pain to much, but how intense and epic is that? The tension is built so well! And then the drums began... \n \"You cannot pass,' he said. The orcs stood still, and a dead silence fell. 'I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. You cannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun. Go back to the Shadow! You cannot pass.\" \n There were also several references to The Hobbit (for example, the three stone Trolls in the woods), which I liked since I read The Hobbit last year. So I would definitely recommend reading that first; mostly also, because the finding of the Ring and the scene between Bilbo and Gollum is described (which by the way was a re-write from Tolkien, after finishing this trilogy; at first, Gollum actually gave Bilbo the Ring and they separated on good terms (source)). I absolutely loved this first part of the trilogy. At this point, I have already read all three the books, and I'm in great doubt which book I liked most; either The Fellowship of the Ring or The Return of the King. Nonetheless, this part was awesome and addicting. \n \"All that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost.\""}

{"text": "Completely loved the start to this series. It captivated me in a way that reminded me of when I first started the City of Bones series. I loved the characters and this magical world is like nothing I've ever read before. I can't wait to see where this story goes from here."}

{"text": "Note: I received a free copy from author Jennifer Carole Lewis in exchange for an honest review. \n \"Wherever there is prey, there are hunters. Jungle, ocean, city - the location doesn't matter. Predators will always find the vulnerable.\" - The opening line for Revelations and one that rings true on several characters and lines in the story. \n Revelations (Book I of The Lalassu) is a quick-paced action-packed adventure mainly about a dancer with super human abilities. For years, Dani has been fighting her family's nagging that she take up the role of High Priestess for the lalassu people in order to serve as their guide and connection with the goddess. However, she wants no part in that and prefers her life as a burlesque dancer. \n Dani also has a darker core, which she calls the Huntress. Often described as a slithering being, the Huntress is meant to be Dani's connection to the goddess. But something is wrong with the Huntress and it appears to be evil or as we later discover, is \"corrupted\". \n \"Concentrating, gathering her personal self... Dani reached deep into her psyche. \n And touched a monster. The Huntress: terrifying, insatiable hunger; ancient rage howling for blood. Linked to the Goddess of her ancestors, it was part of her family's bloodlines, a genetic curse worse than any cancer or disease.\" \n Dani needs to feed the Huntress every few weeks. But because she knows what the dark being will do to her victims, Dani decides to hunt down men who need to be taught a lesson, or simply \"predators\". An example is given in the first few chapters with Josh. \n As Dani exits the club with Josh, we meet Michael Brooks and his cop friend Joe. Michael is a developmental therapist for children. He is kind of like an empath, who is able to read emotions and minds when he gets in contact with others, which he constantly tries to avoid. He uses his gift to discover the secrets children can't share with anyone else. \n \"For everyone else, touch was something casual. It could at times become sensual or intimate, but no one else had to fear it. Every time Michael's skin touched someone or something else, he became privy to their inner thoughts, their darkest secrets, fears and hopes.\" \n Michael senses something strangely dark when he enters the club Dani has just left. People who were out to have fun were in a frenzy of sex and rage. \n The novel shifts between Dani, Michael and Dalhard. The worlds of the first two soon collide especially after one of Michael's clients is kidnapped, and Dani's family is threatened, when her two brothers, both with inhuman speed and strength, are also kidnapped. \n Michael discovers that his charge, Bernie is a medium. What he thought were imaginary friends were actually the ghosts of the dead, bringing her messages and warnings. \n Revelations has an abundance of beautiful but different characters. There are layers upon layers of and character-depth. Although the story is mostly about Dani, and Michael might be a second protagonist or an equal to Dani, others like: Bernie, Joe, Eric, Dalhard and Gwen, all play major roles in the novel. The secondary characters are few, but everyone is important including Nada and Karan. Everyone plays a role and I loved that about the novel. \n One of the things I enjoyed is how Dani, the independent woman, fears what she can do to others. Her gifts are curses. There is a strong character duality, she's both good and bad. She sees the Huntress as evil and fears becoming a Priestess would change her. She also develops feelings for Michael and sees him as naive and too good-natured, making her over-protective of him. \n One of the main themes in the novel is that of the \"hero\". Michael likes comic books, which have shaped his definition of a hero. \"Inside the pages, people who were different became heroes, not freaks. He liked to imagine himself as one of the heroes, using his secret abilities to help others while maintaining a mild-mannered persona.\" \n As the novel progresses, Michael's view of the hero changes and develops. He sees Dani beat up a man who had been stalking one of the dancers. In an instant, the comic book hero who beats the bad guys changes before him after he sees it in a real-life incident. Michael also wants to see Dani as the hero, his, Bernie's and her family's hero. \n Meanwhile, Dalhard, the evil and rich businessman/mastermind, is working hard to \"acquire assets\" or people with superhuman abilities. He tricks Dani's brothers, Eric and Vincent, and we soon discover he has abilities of his own, ones transferred through touch. \n Dalhard later has his eyes on Dani, although he doesn't know anything about her Huntress or her legacy to become the next High Priestess for the Lalassu people, but he sees her as a golden ticket and a vessel for his experiments. \n Dani and Michael have to team up to save the ones they care about as well as the whole of the Lalassu people because Dalhard will stop at nothing to \"acquire\" them for his personal use and for bringing new game-changers to the world of politics. \n On another note, Jennifer Carole also has a way with words and I enjoyed her imagery and word choice throughout the book. (making it hard to pick certain quotes) \n \"But she triggered an uncomfortable wariness, a subliminal warning shivering and shredding the edges of his interest.\" \n One of the things I particularly enjoyed about Revelations and Jennifer Carole's style is her \"show don't tell\" technique. Something many writers struggle with. An example is \"Up close, his looks were even better: easily over six feet with broad shoulders and well-used gym membership.\" And \"She looked like every demonic little girl in a horror film.\" \n Revelations is a quick-paced novel that changes the common perceptions of the \"hero\", with journeys of self-discovery, acceptance and finding romance in unlikely places and people. \n Note II: This book is for adult/mature audiences."}
{"text": "The story starts off a bit slow, but provides some chill inducing moments as it builds up pace."}
{"text": "This fell right in the 1.5-2 star range for me. \n This story is about Geir, a Berserker who happens to also be a shifter bear. He is a bit of a jerk, who has recently awakened from his hibernation. He is desperate for food and sex, and he takes both all the time with little prelude. He is inexplicably in Arizona where he is having all sorts of sex with the nearest wolf pack alpha (Derrick), a junior alpha (Dallas), Derrick's son Jared and a coyote whose name no one bothers to learn. There is a lot of sex, though it is barely interesting. There is no emotional context to this story, just: Bear. Eat. Sex. Repeat. \n There is a four-way scene that is forgettable and a strange twist where the pack turns against Geir and Geir makes them pay. Because, reasons. I did not get the whole Berserker = Bear shifter angle at all. Half the time I felt the sex scenes were a step above rape. \n The story is short, yet strangely bogged with repetition. If I had a dollar for every time Geir recalled he scent of his special lube and how it makes the wet dog smell of his werewolf partners, I could buy me a whole lotta good smelling lube. For. Real. \n The story reads like it's being told at me, and any contradiction is just explained away. (Because reasons again) I would rather a story I can experience and characters with whom I can engage. Sadly, that is not this book. I received a copy of this book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."}
{"text": "A REVIEW FOR CONCERNED PARENTS: \n I have read a great deal of criticism of these books. From the 4 stars I gave this one, you can see I liked it. But I think there are some things concerned parents should know about the books that are not getting represented in the discussion. \n This is a good book for parents to read with young adults and discuss together. These are discussions many parents WANT to have. Discussions about morality, beliefs, sex, decision making, etc. It is also a good series for book club discussion. Simply rejecting the books out of hand is, in my opinion, foolish. Meyer has created complex characters, with a complex plot line, in a complex, fantastical world. But the real gem here is the ability to examine moral dilemmas in the context of relationship. Some examples: \n * Can a vampire be good? This was one of my areas of resistance to the books. I thought Edward was to be evil. But, he wants to do the right thing. He is horrified by his vampire identity, and Meyer has set up her vampire characters with unique stories in which they are not culpable for their transformations. In other words, \"what would you do if, one day, through no fault of your own, you woke up to discover you are a vampire?\" Edward's personal wrestling with the strong attraction he feels for Bella and the self-control required to keep his vampire tendencies in check is an intriguing examination of the role self-control plays in all our lives - of how we respond to challenges in our lives and try to overcome situations that are far from ideal, externally and internally. In many ways, Edward's vampire characteristics mirror our sin nature. Now, the answers in Twilight are purely humanistic, but the examination of the role temptation, sin, redemption and salvation play in our lives are illustrated in a way that can generate a lot of discussion. \n * If a vampire could be good, how does one live that out in a world populated by \"bad\" vampires? What does that look like? The Cullens don't want to live as monsters who take human life, and the fight between good and evil becomes one in which the Cullen family is on the \"good\" side, often fighting against other vampires. That twist made the story appealing, and opens the door for a lot more discussion. What does it mean to try to live a different way, when your nature (sin) and environment are against you? \n There is much more than can be discussed such as: \n * Characteristics of Bella/Edward. What makes her/him appealing to readers? What are her/his strong points? Weak points? In what ways is she/he the typical teen, what is exceptional about him/her? NOTE: These characters do develop, so answers to this question will change over the course of the books. \n *How does Bella embody today's ideas about the role of women in society? How does Edward embody the time period in which he was born and lived before becoming a vampire? How do Bella and Edwards perceptions of the role of men and women differ and how does this impact their relationship? How does the time/ culture in which someone grows up shape their relational expectations? \n * What about Bella's human friends. Why doesn't she 'click' with them? Is she using them? Are they good friends to her? Is she a good friend to them? \n * What are the strengths and weaknesses of Bella's relationship with her parents? Compare and contrast the Cullen's and the Swan's. Which is more typical of families today? How does the authority structure differ? After examining these two types of families, what are the strength and weaknesses of your family of origin? \n * Love: What is true love? Is true love more about feeling or commitment? Why? How is God's love different from ours, such as what are our limits/ in what ways is God not limited? Were Romeo & Juliet wise people? Is their example something that should be imitated? Why or why not? Does such passionate love require youth? How would this story change if Bella/ Edward were in their 50's? Does love change over time? If so, how and why? \n The world of Twilight is such that it is difficult to discuss many of these questions in the context of one book. For example, on the topic of sexual purity. In Book 1, Bella understands that Edward is disciplined about physical boundaries because he is afraid he might hurt her. I have read criticisms that abstinence is only advocated because he is a vampire. But it is not until Book 3, when they know each other better, that Bella starts to realize that Edward is morally conservative, and a discussion of purity and virtue ensues, which leads to a discussion of salvation. A discussion that I think is a highlight of the series. I thought this discussion was critical in understanding how society's view toward sexual purity has changed: \n \"Bella: \"That's it, isn't it? The short laugh that escaped me was more shocked than amused. \"You're trying to protect your virtue!\" I covered my mouth with my hand to muffle the giggle that followed. The words were so... old-fashioned. \"No, silly girl,\" he [Edward:] murmured against my shoulder. I'm trying to protect yours. And you're making it shockingly difficult.\" \n Therefore, this series allows for discussion to develop as the readers get more information. \n This is a good way to interact with young adults. Parents, if your kids are interested, don't miss the opportunity. Sure, you won't agree with everything in the books, and you also probably won't agree with everything your teen thinks/ believes. But you can get to know them. You can examine some of your own ideas about life, relationships, love and spirituality. You can shape what your teens are thinking about. And you can grow your relationship together and as individuals. Take the chance. \n ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \n FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF TWILIGHT: \n I liked this book. I enjoyed it on many levels. Sure, the characters are a bit stilted initially, but I thought it added to the mystery and discovery. I found Meyer's brand of vampires unique. The plot line of discovering who they are, how they became the way they did and what their life was like was as intriguing as the relationship between Edward and Bella. The plot pacing was excellent. Just when you are starting to get a handle on the relationship between Edward and Bella, the plot goes crazy vampire! \n Some more comments: \n It's true that Bella's harping on Edward's physical perfection gets tiring and is not a good role model for young adults. However, it was credible to me. IF a vampire, one of whose characteristics was physical perfection, fell in love with an ordinary teenager, certainly said teenager would be insecure about her physical ordinariness. \n I enjoyed the supernatural elements of the vampires, and found the entire family intriguing - and I am not a big sci-fi, horror, vampire, not even gothic kinda gal. I thought the idea that they were ravishingly beautiful and rich, yet isolated and lonely was clever and fit well with the idea that \"everything about me is designed to lure in my prey - you\". This also creates a positive instruction for young people - even people who 'have it all' need to connect with others and can feel alienated by the very perfection others covet. And, sometimes the external things we covet can hide inner realities that aren't desirable. \n There is a sense in which Edward and Bella's relationship can cross the line into idolatrous worship. This is dangerous, but not uncommon when in the throws of first love. I'll have to see whether or not this continues. \n In other young adult books I have read, I have been bothered by the teen-centered action, the assumption that all adults are hopelessly inadequate to the challenges of teen world. While it is true that Bella works around her parents, the vampire plot line does lend itself to being exceptional. And the other adults, Charlie, Renee and Billy Black, specifically, are treated respectfully. Edward consults his family, particularly his father, Carlisle, regularly. That was welcome. However, behind the scenes reality is that Edward is a 100 something year old vampire and his family structure reflects a group of interdependent adults, thus softening the adults are valuable to the teen experience message. The negative side of this is that the Cullens lie to and work around Bella's parents repeatedly. It's true, this is for both Bella and their protection. But transporting her to other states and continuing to keep them in the dark about her safety, as well as encouraging her to behave in a way that is hurtful to them is not an example to be encouraged. Of course, things could have been dealt with much more efficiently if her father, especially, and her mother, not so essentially were 'in on it', but that would lessen the drama... \n I appreciated the lack of swearing, sex, crime, etc. \n I found it interesting that it rained for 2 days straight when I read this book, it was a lot like living in Forks! \n I loved the comedy. The banter between Bella and Edward - their ability to laugh about how weird life is when two different people come together (so much of what was going on between them happens in real life when two people connect on a truly deep emotional level!). It was realistic that some of their jokes fell flat if the other wasn't on the same page, or found a topic too sensitive. My favorite line was written when Bella is stomping through Port Angeles, trying not to think of Edward and spots his silver Volvo in town. Haven't we all had that experience of trying to forget about someone/ something only to have it keep inserting itself in our mind through random occurrence? Bella's thought is: \"Stupid, unreliable vampire, I thought to myself.\" I laughed out loud! Apparently, Stephanie Meyer doesn't take her story TOO seriously. \n Certainly there are reflections of other literature here. Bella's absolute trust in Edward's goodness made me think of Marie's character in Ludlum's Bourne Identity. Of course, the dark super naturalism and war between good and evil has often been compared to Harry Potter. The fairy tale Thumbelina came to mind in regard to the role of sunlight in the story. Bella's melancholic paranoia scented to me of Jane Eyre, even before I read Stephanie Meyer's web page where she declared Mr. Rochester of Bronte's Jane Eyre, and Mr. Ferras of Austin's Sense & Sensibility as her inspiration for Edward's name. Yet Meyer has combined these elements with her own ideas to create something entirely new and I think the work has the substance to stand on it's own. \n I'm not ready to scream on the street, go get autographs, and camp out overnight awaiting the next release, but I thought this book was engaging and unique. I'm looking forward to reading more. 4 stars. \n There's more, and I hated Book #2 \n New Moon (Twilight #2), Meyer, 2006 \n https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."}
{"text": "I've heard people go on and on about fairytale retellings, but I had yet to experience one for myself, so I didn't really get all the fuss. \n Cue music, enter Jackson Pearce \n Sisters Red is a retelling of Little Red Riding Hood, and it knocked my socks off. Jackson Pearce didn't just change a few things to make it more modern and a little different than the original - she took the concept of the fairytale, amped it up ten notches, added romance, and twisted in some family conflict. \n Every little detail of this book was carefully planned and meant to have a connection with the plot, which made me love it that much more. Jackson Pearce is a crafty, crafty writer. \n Sisters Red had the perfect amount of action and dialogue for me. I'm one who would prefer to see a character's growth than a bad guy sliced in half with a sword, and I never found myself wishing I were reading about anything else besides what Pearce had on the pages. In fact, I read the second half of this book sitting in the drivers seat of my car waiting for someone else and didn't mind the cramped, uncomfortable reading space at all. \n Pearce has another fairytale retelling coming out - Sweetly. It is \"Sisters Red #2,\" but I am fairly certain it is only #2 because it is also a retelling, not because we carry on the story of Scarlett and Rosie. In fact, if it DOES carry on their story, I may be a little upset, because Sisters Red is a 50/50 for me just the way it is. \n Sisters Red is a superb example of a fairytale retelling, and one I would recommend hands down."}

{"text": "I was originally pretty reluctant to pick up this book as there's a flood of Dystopian post-apocalyptic/war torn fairy tales being shoved out recently in the wake of the hunger games success, and most aren't worth reading quality wise. \n Sheer boredom drove me to randomly start reading Red queen and I'm glad i did. \n Nothing gets me like a good thief protaganist! \n I actually read the whole book in a day because i was drawn into the writing style and characters. \n Red queen is a short but enjoyable read."}
{"text": "Half-way through this book, I was feeling completely underwhelmed. I think this book had to have made the biggest, most satisfying comeback in book history. I read the second half almost in one sitting, and when I had to stop reading to go to class, I couldn't stop thinking about when I could race home to finish it. Most people that have read and enjoyed Vampire Academy and Bloodlines will tell you that the series only gets better after the first book--and I completely agree. I think that aspect of Mead's writing style is reflected in this book as well. The Glittering Court is technically a \"series\", but in reality, it's the same story being told three times from different perspectives, so the book actually reads as a stand alone. I think that's why I found the first half so boring. A lot needed to be set up so that the second half could wrap itself up, and once the foundations were laid and the character relationships were built, the book was AMAZING. However, a lot of aspects about the first half did annoy me. Adelaide and Tamsin could both be very pretentious and annoying at times, and a lot of \"issues\" they faced--like what colors they were dressed in or the decorations for events-- I didn't really care about. But by the second half of the book, Adelaide felt like a completely different character, and I loved her, so it ended up being great character development on Mead's part. I am excited to read the other two books and learn more about the other characters, but I really, really wish this series would have just followed Adelaide and Cedric's story because I ended up loving them so much by the end of the story and I feel like if their story continued I probably would've ended up loving it as much as bloodlines."}

{"text": "After all the fun I had with Stray, I was expecting to love Rogue just as much. Sadly, I found it disappointing. \n First off, although this one is smaller than the first book, I found it to drag. I thought the plot was very predictable, and we were missing all of the character interactions that I loved from the first book. \n Also, Faythe's character wasn't what it was in the first book. I found her rashness to be more annoying than enjoyable. There were also times where a plot point was very obvious, and it took her some time to figure out. This is not the perceptive character I loved in the first book. \n Lastly, I found the relationship in this book to be problematic. What was an equal power dynamic in the first book switched to a relationship that read as very emotionally abusive. I expect these alpha male type characters in a book like this, and I can enjoy them. But the love interest crossed the lines in a lot of ways in this book and Faythe did not have the power that she had in the first book, which rubbed me the wrong way. \n Overall, I found this book to be a completely different experience than the first book. I do plan to continue on with the series, but I am going to take a break before continuing, as this book left me with a bad taste in my mouth. \n This review was originally posted on Thoughts on Tomes"}
{"text": "I know I loved the first book and I thought it was one of the best books of 09 I'd read (US release). This book is even better then the first. Its got a lot less traveling so the plot is more focused. Also Chadbourn seems to explain things a little easier in this book then the first. At times I'd get lost in the first book but this was just wonderful. \n There are still landmarks in the book but they aren't as prodominant instead it's more about the characters and seeing them grow in their magic."}
{"text": "Another fun collection from Charlaine Harris and Toni L.P. Kelner. This book of short stories is connected by a central theme of vacations. But these certainly aren't ordinary vacations. Apparently even supernatural beings need the occasional get-away. All of the usual suspects are certainly present (vampires, werewolves) but also some very unusual creatures (gargoyles, leprechauns). Death's Excellent Vacation was a very enjoyable read that took a week to finish only because it is so easy to put down a book of short stories without losing the narrative thread. It was great to take my time and savor each one slowly."}

{"text": "3 stars is generous, maybe 2.5,but I did end up wrapped up in the story closer to the end--or the point where nothing is resolved, from my perspective. Imagine being a young child and everyone was afraid of you, including your parents. No one willingly touches you, hugs you, comforts you with tenderness and understanding because no one understands--what you are or what you are capable of. Scary, yes? \n This is how Juliette Farreras grew up until the government took her from parents who couldn't feel anything but relief and put her in an asylum. She has a fascination with numbers and repeating truths to herself, there isn't much of an explaination except for her isolation. At seventeen, she had been isolated for almost a year when she suddenly gets a roommate. No one can touch her without touching death, but for some reason this boy, her only roommate ever, can comfort her. He can touch her, too, without any harm to him. Everybody wants her--some to use her as a weapon, some for power, some want her to be free, but only one wants her forever. \n There are TONS of unresolved issues. We never find out why the world came to war. We never find out...oh, there are too many of these. I was sorely disappointed because I really ended up liking many of the characters and the story just abruptly ended. I may read the next part of the series, but I will rage at my stupidity if I am duped again."}
{"text": "I'm a big fan of this author's Mercy Thompson series so picking up this spin off was a no-brainer for me. Patricia Briggs does not disappoint. In this one, Book 2, hero Charles, the alpha werewolf son of the leader of the North American packs takes his mate, Anna, an Omega, to a meeting of all the alpha leaders of the European packs to discuss the coming out of their race to humanity. Someone doesn't want that transition to go smoothly and is ready to kill to disrupt it. Anna is only one of the targets. This is an urban fantasy so things get a bit gory and are not for readers with queasy stomachs but for fans of this genre, Charles and Anna are a wonderful team, the villian and secondary characters are well developed, the plot is intriguing and the political intrigue slithers through at a brisk pace as the reader is pulled deeply into this magical world of supernatural creatures. I'm definitely picking up Book 3 to see what their next adventure will be."}
{"text": "SUMMARY \n When Mira is apprenticed to a witch, the witch's apprentice adopts her as a sister. Too late, Mira learns that she should not trust her new sister when she changes Mira into a magic mirror. Mira's sister becomes the wicked queen of \"Snow White\" fame while Mira, once her usefulness has worn out, is abandoned. The end of the \"Snow White\" tale is barely the first act of Mira's enchanting story. When Ivana, a peasant girl running away from her cruel father, stumbles upon Mira, Mira sees a chance to possibly restore her original form. Mira manipulates Ivana into becoming best friends with a wealthy merchant's daughter named Talia. Mira uses her magic to change the girls' appearances so each resembles the other. What Mira does not anticipate is that Talia is quite happy with her new form and is not as easily manipulated as Ivana. It will take all of Mira's cunning to regain enough power to restore her form, but as she comes to know Talia and Ivana, will Mira be as ruthless with their lives as she needs to be? \n MY OPINION \n The bio on Mette Ivie Harrison tells us that she studied German in college, \"which is where she got her taste for the grim side of fairy tales.\" I hate to break it to you, but from a feminist perspective, all fairy tales are grim. Anyway. There certainly is a tendency toward the grim, or, at least, bittersweet, in Harrison's books. I had read Harrison's The Princess and the Hound, which was akin enough (in theme, at least) to Robin McKinley's Deerskin that I enjoyed it, bittersweet ending and all. \n I gave this book three of five stars largely because of Harrison's writing style. Her prose flows easily, her dialogue is well-written, and if the plot lingers too often, well, you feel as though you're on a leisurely holiday stroll. \n The rest of the book, however, doesn't merit more than a star, a star and a half. While the premise is captivating, the plot and the characters fall flat. The characterization of Mira is decidedly lacking, although she has the potential to be one of the greatest characters of this genre. Talia and Ivana are created similarly. It's as though Harrison is reigning herself in from describing them as kick-ass heroines, and thus all she does is weaken and diminish them. \n In terms of the plot, you could substitute my father's catch-all spoiler phrase \"they were ran over by a bus\" and not miss much of what's going on. There's no climax, no great repentance, even though Harrison tries her best to make you believe there is. It leaves the book hopelessly lacking. \n Other goodreads.com reviewers say that this is a retelling of \"Snow White,\" although, in fact, it includes elements of a number of faery tales, such as Beauty & the Beast, or the lesser known \"Snow White and Rose Red.\" You might try Gregory Maguire's \"Mirror, Mirror\" for a Snow White retelling that's just as dark, though it's written for an older crowd. \n Actually, though, I'm not sure whether to tag this book as middle-grade or young-adult. One of the girls is sexually assaulted, which makes me think YA; then again, the end is morally trite enough (love conquers hate) to make me think middle-grade. There's the torture of a pregnant deer, but there's the simple sentimentality of sisterly bonds. \n This is a book that's going on my Paperback Swap shelf, because there are any number of other books I'd prefer to own than Mira, Mirror."}
{"text": "Green Angel is a tender fable of loss and life by the inimitable storyteller, Alice Hoffman.

Non sono riuscita a metterlo giu! \n In un mondo post apocalittico invaso da angeli vendicatori, scosso da violenti terremoti, da tsunami, e sotto un cielo denso di fumo a causa della costante pioggia di meteoriti, vive la nostra Penryn. Quel che resta dopo l'invasione degli angeli e un mondo al collasso, dove non esiste piu nessuna forma di societa, dove imperversa il caos totale. \n Penryn inoltre, deve prendersi cura della sorellina disabile e della madre affetta da schizofrenia paranoica, dopo che il padre le ha abbandonate. \n Lei non e la classica protagonista sprovveduta, indifesa e bisognosa di protezione, anzi e l'esatto opposto : coraggiosa, determinata, altruista e addestrata in maniera impeccabile. \n In un mondo dove gli angeli sono creature spietate e senza scrupoli, Penryn dovra accettare erroneamente, proprio di allearsi con uno di loro: Raffe (non Raf il cantante grrr). \n Raffe e un angelo caduto, al quale sono state strappare le ali, ed e vivo solo grazie all'intervento fortuito di Penryn. \n Lei ha bisogno del suo aiuto per trovare la madre, e sopratutto la sorellina che e stata rapita, proprio dai suoi simili. \n A Raffe occorre una guida per orientarsi, e trovare la Roccaforte dove si trovano i suoi simili, verso i quali ha un grosso conto in sospeso. \n Un'alleanza forzata, un percorso pieno di insidie, nemici e pericoli... \n Lo stile di Susan Ee e talmente fluido, scorrevole ed avvincente, che ho la netta sensazione di trovarmi al centro della scena narrata. Un susseguirsi di immagini nitide ed inquietanti, che si dipanano nella mia mente con strema chiarezza. \n Una narrazione che riesce a mantenere il mio interesse sempre costante, grazie alla capacita della Ee di variare i toni. \n Angelfall e Macabro, inquietante, imprevedibile e con un bel pizzico di romance, che grazie al cielo non prende vita da un istant love! \n Una lettura che fortunatamente non mi sono preclusa, nonostante la nostra editoria abbia fatto di tutto per \"distruggere\" il potenziale di questa saga, perche credo che Susan Ee sia un autrice degna di nota! \n P.s Raffe io ti amo.

{"text": "Steampunk is one of my favorite genres, with the uniqueness of zeppelins, automons, gears & gadgets, alchemy and Victorian fashion with a twist! This book is meant for those who love reading a young adult story with plenty of action, drama, and a bit of romance. \n The Chronicles of Steele:Raven did not disappoint with the essentials for a steampunk world. The world building blended seamlessly with the storyline. The characters were interesting and enjoyable, even the villains came into their own throughout the story. The main character Raven is more relatable than most in the story because while she has a hard exterior, you learn there is so much more which leaves her vulnerable. \n One thing I was not a fan of during the story is Creeden would start a tangent or a potential life altering situation without going into further detail or circling back. Hopefully some of those loose ends will tie into the second book. \n I had the opportunity to read the story as a whole rather than in Episodes. I did find that the episodes transitions were almost non-existent. However, I would recommend reading the story as a whole; I can image how frustrating it might be to have to stop an episode each time something major in the plot occurs. \n I received Chronicles of Steele in exchange for an honest review. Overall the story is 4/5."}

{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n I like the story, looking forward to starting the next one, but I'm not totally into half the characters, and what is UP with \"(insert character here) arched a brow\"??? The phrase appears almost every time 2 characters have a conversation. \n Not kidding, every time I saw it, I marked the page with a post-it. If I can find a way to attach the pic I will. I didn't notice it in the first book, but I'll definitely be on the lookout for it in the next one. I haven't read any of his other books, but I know the guy has written a lot of them so I know he knows more words to adequately describe a haughty, questioning, or mischievous look (hey, look! There's 3 words and I'm not even a pro). Maybe, since the concept of the book was the basis of a bet, he worked in this stupid phrase as a part of the joke. \n (Spoiler-ish below) \n I can't stand Isana, and Amara and Bernard are getting tiresome, but i do like Tavi, though he has to be the dumbest person in Alera to not have figured out his parentage yet, or at least who his father was. Even his name is a clue, if you are familiar with Latin numerals. He even knows who Fade really is and still hasn't worked it out. \n But I'm on the hook for the rest of the series at this point, so I'll have to let it go."}
{"text": "First let me start by saying that I did enjoy reading this book - great characters, interesting plot and a bit of twist. However it is one of those books where I loved part of it but didn't enjoy other parts of the story quite so much. \n The book tells the story of Jason who is desperate to escape from someone who is out to kill him. He is tired of running and approaches Quinn, a PI, for help. Quinn has personal reasons for wanting to protect Jason from the bad guy, reasons involving the death of his lover. \n The story is told in first person, with the telling of the tale alternating between the main characters, Quinn and Jason. It is interesting to gain insight into each characters thoughts and to understand their feelings. In this case, equal time is spent with each character's POV, with minimal overlap of events. \n However I did feel that there was a little too much back and forth and would have preferred more time with each character before switching. At times I also felt that I was being told what was happening in the story, a pure account, rather than losing myself in the book/experiencing it. \n I think this book had one of the most unique introductions to one of the main characters I have seen in a while, with Jason's first impression of Quinn - asleep with drool down his chin, uncombed and unwashed hair, unkempt beard and stained clothes! \".....he looked like life had been beating him up for a while.\" Over the course of the book, we see changes in Quinn from having little interest in life to returning to his old self, assisted by his feelings for Jason. We also see Jason start to think of a future, rather than running. \n Things are complicated with Quinn having to come to terms with his feelings for a man other than his lost lover and he has to reassure Jason that he sees him for who he is. He needs Jason to trust him. Similarly Jason needs to learn to trust Quinn after years on the run and trusting no one. \n I loved the characters and their backgrounds. I was hoping they would get together and overcome the bad guys. I enjoyed the first 50% immensely. But here's where my opinion of the book gets slightly divided. \n **Warning the below might be considered slightly spoilerish but probably not once bookshelves and more reviews are added** \n Things started to get a little strange (the blurb doesn't give any hint , I didn't look closely enough at the sub-genres and the Goodreads bookshelves had no reference) as the story starts to become about the supernatural - monsters, evil fairies, superpowers and the like. The change was reminiscent of the movie From Dusk Till Dawn. At this point I went from loving the book to liking the book. \n There are a couple of potential reasons for this. It could be because it was unexpected. It could be that as a rule I usually prefer contemporary romance. It could be because the supernatural change didn't happen until halfway through the book so when it occurred it seemed a bit more unbelievable than if the situation had been set up from the beginning. \n My rating for this book is therefore 3.5 stars although I believe that people looking to read a paranormal/fantasy may rate this higher. \n This book was supplied by the publisher, Wilde City Press, in return for an honest review."}
{"text": "I have to say this is one of the more un-realistic werewolf books I've read. For one the main characters literally only know each other for 3 days before they are madly in love and she is ready to move to an entirely new country leaving everything she's ever known behind for him. I just could believe in their relationship it was simply boring. The only other thing is that the main heroine has these 2 friends that I swear I would have completely erased one of them and toned the other down if I could just to much they were really annoying. Not sure if I'm going to read the other in the series to see if it gets better or not. I just couldn't get into this one and had to push through it."}
{"text": "See full review for The Last Echo at: http://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.w... \n A question for all the authors out there: when you're writing a book with a female narrator or main character, and you introduce several guy characters into her story, do you automatically think, hm, there should be a love triangle? Or does that plot point come up as you go along? I feel like I need to ask this question, because in about every other supernatural/paranormal book I read, there always seems to be a love triangle between the main character and the guys she knows. The Last Echo was no exception to that rule, which I was really disappointed. Not only did this series go from having the best guy friend being the main character's boyfriend, but now we have a love triangle too. \n Violet is readjusting to her life again. This time she has to get used to being on a team of people who know that she's different. A whole bunch of new characters get introduced - Gemma, Krystal, Sam, etc. - while Sara and Rafe are kept around. The team that Violet is on is investigating a new case. College girls are turning up dead. A new serial killer - called the collector - is on the loose. And unfortunately for Violet, he seems to have taken a new interest in her, even though she isn't the type of girl he goes for. What happens changes the course of Violet's life forever."}
{"text": "4.5 stars \n Actually, I'm not really enjoy at first due to lots of new words in the book that will make me read slowly. \n However, when I start to be familiar with the story. All things become gorgeous. \n The adventure is really astonished. With magic and different kinds of monsters, it makes the whole imaginary world be so authentic."}
{"text": "What a great book that takes the idea of wizardry and not only incorporates it into a current day timeframe, but also turns the fantasy element of magic into science. The main character finds a book in her local library that sets her on the career path of becoming a wizard. Enter explanations of magic and how it affects the universe(s). Some may find parts difficult to easily read because it does explain wizardry like a textbook, but this allows the reader to imagine that, just possibly, they have found this book and are reading to become a wizard themselves. Not only do you root for the human characters trying to slow the death of the Universe, but also the non-human characters. I love this book and the world that exists inside it."}
{"text": "If you thought Hex Hall was good, you're in for a treat with Demonglass. \n I will admit, when starting this book I couldn't remember the fine details of Hex Hall, but the author does a nice job of recapping events as they come up in the context of Demonglass. This leaves Hex Hall #2 at a perfect place to expand upon what we know, what we remember, and even the small nuances we may have forgotten. \n The story of Demonglass is quite a bit more complex than Hex Hall, as it should be. We pick up pretty much exactly where Hex Hall left off-Sophie waiting for her dad. Rachel Hawkins is the self proclaimed queen of cliffhanger endings for chapters (as she declared on Twitter, to which I wholeheartedly agree), which means you'll be telling yourself 'just one more chapter' many times throughout, right up until the action hits you and you're unable to stop reading, cliffhangers or not. \n Many events in Demonglass are unexpected, which will keep you on your toes as a reader. Just when I thought we were on one path, Hawkins would flip and get Sophie, Cal, and the rest of the crew in another situation entirely. If I had written my predictions as to how the book would go after I had read a few chapters, I would not have been even remotely close to where we ended up - which, unfortunately, is another cliffhanger. \n I am now dying to read Hex Hall 3, which you will be too. Demonglass was even better than Hex Hall, and I am hoping Hex Hall 3 delivers as well!"}

{"text": "When I first started reading Secrets of the Sands I wasn't sure what to think. There was something around page 80 or so that snapped my attention and I literally could not put this book down (I read it while I played computer games, walked and talked it was that bad). \n The characters were interesting, and the world that Wisoker creates is very detailed and enjoyable to read about.The world is a bit dark at times with drugs, sex and violence but it's the way the world it brought to the reader that really makes it pop throughout the plot. \n I don't want to spoil anything but I loved how she eventually brought both character POV's to one. The amount of political intrigue really kept me reading. \n There is a bit of humor at times in this book, but not so much that it's overdone or stale. There were parts where I found myself chucking or laughing. \n I found myself growing to love and truly care about every single character in this book. It was as if the reader saw the characters grow, and change right before their eyes and that was really fun and amazing. I am proud to say that I will gladly be reading the second book, I wish it were out right now I'd jump right into it."}

{"text": "This is an interesting collection of novellas/short stories of (mainly) M/M connections that occur over the Christmas holidays. There are a lot if interracial couples, and also, a solid paranormal bent, which was fun. \n The stories vary in heat, most of which have limited sex on the page. I enjoyed the cross-cultural stories--if is was a young Korean man finding solace with a blind widower, or a black Vaudun master helping a Japanese figure skating phenom--there was such diversity I was charmed. \n There was a transitioning male in a relationship, and I felt the situation was handled with care and thought. I think my fave story of the bunch was Two Parts Mistletoe which featured a potions master helping rescue a nobleman from a love potion--and the devoted secretary who sought magical aid. lock and Hux were adorable! \n If you like a wide variety of paranormal romance, featuring diverse partners and a touch of steam this one will satisfy. I received a copy via NetGalley."}
{"text": "3.5 stars. Mostly for fun factor. Okay, all for fun factor. This book was fun. \n This book was a big surprise for me. It began with one of the most eye-roll inducing instaloveyist instaloves I ever read. Seriously bad stuff. The hero knew he was in love with the heroine within twenty-four hours and was just walking around in a haze of hearts with cupid's arrow sticking out of his ass. It seemed utterly ridiculous to me. Not gonna lie, I was ready to DNF. To just...walk away. \n But for some unknown reason, I kept reading. Call it stubbornness but I think it was just because I was bored. But I kept going. And then somehow, the plot thickened. Shit started going down. There was the faintest likelihood of a love triangle that wasn't really a love triangle but brought out some super fun jealousy. The heroine was spunky and smart. The romance really kicked up a notch. More characters were introduced. And I found myself having a damn ball. \n It was far from perfect. Actually, it had a lot of issues. Annoying ones. Too much this. Not enough that. Yet somehow it managed to be really fun and quite entertaining. \n Plot: Werewolves hate Jaguars (shifters) and vice versa. Lana is a Jaguar but doesn't know it. Adam is a werewolf and does know it, and also knows Lana is a Jaguar (wolfy smelling skills). Lana is on the run from shady dudes that she believes are from a mental hospital. She went to the hospital for what she thought was a mental illness of some kind but was actually her shifting into a giant cat every full moon and blacking out. Adam finds her in a diner and walks in all \"It's a full moon, why are you around a bunch of people? Don't you know you could end up eating them because you are a horrible Jaguar and are about to shift soon?\" She laughs in his face. Obviously, he's off his rocker. But the danger is real, the full moon is that night. Then the shady dudes that Lana thinks are from the hospital show up except they are carrying guns are most definitely not from the hospital. Adam kicks their asses and helps Lana escape. When he touches her, he gets that special kind of tingle that means they are mates. He is upset, to say the least. Interspecies mates aren't a thing. Plus their kind hate each other. From there we have the standard \"man must protect mate\" thing. She is of course wildly attracted to him too, but it turns out that Jaguars don't do the \"mate\" thing. Interesting twist. She has to figure out she loves him on her own. BUT something both werewolves and Jaguars have in common is that neither have females born as shifters. Both werewolves and Jaguars have to bite the human females of their choice, converting them into shifters before they can start a family. Lana finds out that she is one in a million and that is why she is being hunted. There is a reason she is the way she is and she is wanted by all sorts of people. \n There is an interesting look at racism throughout the book. Or specieism? Is that a thing? Adam and his pack have to take a look at the way they automatically hate every Jaguar they see. Even if the Jaguars they have dealt with are all awful, they shouldn't condemn the entire shifter species. Adam has less of an issue with this because he has the whole mate thing going for him. But he knows his pack would never accept her so he doesn't take her home to meet the family. She has no choice but to remain his dirty little secret and that doesn't bode well for their relationship. Because Lana didn't grow up with Jaguar parents telling her that werewolves are awful, she has no prejudice. She is understandably angry when Adam's pack hates her on sight when they know nothing about her. It gave the book surprising depth. And I really liked the way it was resolved in the end because it could have been done badly and instead, I found myself tearing up. Someone was probably just cutting onions near by. Whatever. \n While this may just be me, I found it really really weird that a werewolf trained horses. In fact, a whole lot of werewolves. He has a ranch, he lives there. So do the horses, obviously. They shift once a month. Wouldn't there be some underlying wolfy smell that would cause unease in a horse? The smell must linger. Is this a weird thing to wonder? I don't know. But it just stuck out as strange to me throughout the entire book. Why do horses love him? And even more, why with Lana too? Would a Jaguar eat a horse on the full moon? I mean, she killed and ate a squirrel once. Are horses just too big? What if Adam was super hungry in wolf form? Wouldn't he spook the hell out of his horses? I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS. \n The writing itself left a little to be desired. The entire thing was pretty much tell with very little show. Fortunately, that worked for me. I was exhausted and in a lot of pain (stupid knee) and I really didn't mind everything being spoon fed to me. I didn't have to work for anything and I was totally okay with that. \n Adam was a chest thumper, all alpha don't-touch-her-she's-mine. It wasn't really a problem for me because I'm pretty sure that's why we read shifter romance. There is an animal in the men and it gives them a legitimate excuse to act that way without it being an issue. The fact that Lana was a Jaguar didn't really change her personality much and I kind of wish it had. I mean, werewolves have wolfy qualities. What would giant cat qualities be like? There was an interesting opportunity there to use cat vs. dog personality stuff. \n One of the things that were really different about this world of shifters was that they did not have any kind of special healing powers or gift or whatever you want to call it. If they were shot, they bled and had to heal like everyone else. If they broke a bone, they had to be off their feet for a month or two (or more, if they actually listened to their damned doctor). It gave them a vulnerability that I don't think I've ever read in a shifter romance. It certainly made things interesting to know that if a shifter was hit by a truck crossing the street (which was not part of the plot, I'm just making a point) then, they would have to deal with the same ramifications and fears as everyone else. More in fact, because no shifter wants to go to a hospital. Hospitals are the fastest way for their shifter existence to be exposed. \n All in all, this was a really fun read. It wasn't earth shattering or probably even award winning, but I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and do plan on continuing with the series. The next book is about Adam's twin brother and I just know who his mate is going to be and I can't way to see how it plays out."}
{"text": "Iolanthe and Titus go back to school, feeling strong and confident about their mission. But destiny has a bit of a challenge to them, when it seems there is another great elemental, and he is the one that Titus's mother sees in her vision. \n I think I liked this one better than the first one, but there were some things I didn't quite like. First, was the fact that it alternated between the school and the dessert, one story in the past and the other one in the present. I get that it didn't revealed much, but I would have rather a linear story, because it did reveal enough for me to not take some things about the story seriously Like the fight between Iolanthe and Titus, and they \"we are going in separate ways\" thing. It didn't make any sense if they ended up in the dessert together! \n I liked the story, but what I liked the most was the fact that it planted some questions about destiny and prophecies, questions Titus didn't really asked himself. I was annoyed at how blind Titus was most of the book, and how he didn't question anything about the visions. But I liked the fact that it tackles the paradox that happens when you have a glimpse of the future: if you see something in the future, and you act so that it happens, was it really going to happen, or it did because of the vision? \n I also liked that at the end, there is no answer. And that they are fighting against the Bane not because they know they are going to win, and not because they are destined to. \n I did think some twist of the book were predictable, but others took me by surprise. And it also ends on a huge cliffhanger. Can't wait for the next book!"}

{"text": "I'm still not sure what this book is about. Robert is a young black teen in Virginia in a near-future setting. The government has people under surveillance and the populace lives in fear of the medical community, to some degree. \n Robert cares about wrestling, and himself. He thinks he's gay, but he doesn't act on it. He is being raised by his father, as his mom was murdered six years ago on his birthday. Robert has a token girlfriend, but they don't get physical. \n In his current place in this story Robert is plagued by hallucinations that become stringer as his birthday comes closer. These hallucinations cause him to act erratically, and even violently, at times. There is violence in the book--school fights that become brutal--and some race baiting. \n Honestly, I have no idea what happens in this story except that Robert gets disqualified in the regional wrestling tourney for tossing his opponent into the stands in a hallucination fueled freak out. Oh, and he has a weird acne problem that requires more medications than I've ever heard of--and this acne bothers Robert a lot. \n So, pretty much nothing happens except that Robert freaks out a lot, worries a lot, and broods a lot. It took me about ten tries to slog through this book, with nothing to show for my effort. There is a planned series. I'm not up to meeting that challenge. I barely talked myself into finishing this book. I got a copy of this book via NetGalley. This is my honest review."}
{"text": "A good read but definitely my least favorite Mistborn novel. I have really come to care for these characters (in particular I love Steris with an unholy love) and their relationships to each other and there were definitely some cool concepts/plot twists but I also found the book way too action heavy and the third act \"twist\" involving a certain character's behavior/alliances didn't pack the emotional punch for me I think Sanderson wanted it to. \n There was so much interesting information about the politics of Elendel in the last volume, I really missed that this time around. I feel like the other Mistborn books all have a lot more going on then what is essentially a quest for magical artifact/heist narrative. \n I still look forward to how Sanderson is going to wrap up this installment of the Mistborn saga in the next book."}
{"text": "4.5 Stars for this futuristic M/M adventure romance. \n Tover Duke is one of 42 navigators in the galaxy. He is esteemed by all for his ability to shift cargo and people, using only his voice and some sophisticated technology and body implants, to great distances across space, and is well paid for his service to the Harmony Corporation. He loves his beautiful hotel suite home, and his aviary stocked with tame birds, but he doesn't love how he has to sneak around to find men for his pleasure. Harmony Corp doesn't approve of same-sex relationships, and Tover has had to hide behind trysts with women. He has one special man he routinely seeks out--Cruz, an engineer who occasionally pops into the space station where Tover lives and works, but those reunions are few and far between. \n On Tover's 30th birthday there's a huge celebration--and it's interrupted by the advent of a disheveled Cruz popping in and taking Tover hostage. Cruz convinces Tover to \"jump\" them both to a remote space station. As soon as they arrive, Tover is taken into custody, and traded to pirates aboard the station to secure the release of Cruz and his associates. (It seemed clear that this was the best of a lot of bad options for Cruz, and one he agreed to reluctantly.) While imprisoned on the pirates' vessel, Tover is beaten and tortured for his unwillingness to assist moving the pirates' cargo. \n He's rescued later, but the damage has been done. His torture has resulted in psychological damage that causes him physical and visceral pain whenever he even considers \"jumping.\" That doesn't bode well for Tover's illustrious career in transport. While recuperating in a locale that's surrounded by enemies, Tover begins to see that his early life was not a roasy as it seemed, and his work for Harmony not as straight-forward. Cruz is back, and his true colors are shown in a way that earns Tover's grudging acceptance. \n I loved how this story worked. It had excellent elements of futuristic life, and technological elements that thrilled my inner-geek. The love story between Tover and Cruz is rocky, but took it's natural course toward an eventual and appropriately delayed HEA. In the reading I was struck by parallels to Dune: galaxy-bending transport, falling in with a native of a foreign world, understanding and championing the underdog against a galactic behemoth hierarchy. \n I've had this one in my TRB for too long, and relished the rich world-building. I think the big disappointment I had was a lack of the dialogue/culture uniqueness. Cruz and his associates speak Spanish, and have a deeply Hispanic culture. While I liked that there was some cultural inclusion, it was not terribly different from today's speech or manner. And, that was my disappointment. Having been a long time fan of the richness of alien culture (think Enemy Mine, think Star Trek etc) having these CO2-breathing humanoids sit down to a table full of tamales was...anti-climactic. It's like having a Klingon sit down to the traditional feast of hamburgers. That said, the story was truly compelling and the love story one to root for. There are few sexytimes, but what exist are tender and passionate. I really enjoyed this one and hope there might be more work in this world to enjoy. \n I received a review copy via NetGalley."}
{"text": "*2.5 stars* HALLELUJAH I AM DONE WITH THIS BOOK! This book took me far longer to read than I'd anticipated. There were parts that I enjoyed, but overall, this book was EXHAUSTING. I didn't feel invested in any of the characters. In fact, I cared less about everyone than I did during the previous books. The only feelings that remained constant were my EXTREME dislike for Wolf and Scarlet. The plot felt beyond absurd at best and downright annoying at worst. Also, the introduction to Princess Winter that we get in the book does not at all make me want to continue reading because Winter is INSANE. Straight up psychotic. If Cress was a torturous, I certainly could not read a book centred around a character like Winter. I will not be continuing The Lunar Chronicles any time soon, if ever. This series was just not for me."}
{"text": "When Stan Lee (the unstoppable comic book legend) and Disney (the world's largest media and entertainment company) band together, things really can't go too wrong and they'll probably go quite right. \n Such is the case for Convergence. Action packed and exciting, this novel- which includes comic book style illustrations, was a bit frenzied but a lot of fun. The first in a series, the story works its way through the assembling of the team, explaining the stakes and providing info about the situation and the powers involved. As a result of this world building, the plot was light on character development and a bit too heavy on the quest for non-stop action, but I am eager to see what's next on the agenda, as I can envision the series getting stronger now that introductions have been made and the base of the \"legacy\" has been established. \n Thank you to Disney Book Group and NetGalley for providing this ARC in exchange for an honest review."}

There's just something about them that don't live up to the hype that they've created. However, that being said, I have been proven wrong before in the past and with this book I was definitely proven wrong. Not only did this book have a satisfying conclusion - mostly but we'll get into that later - but it also had ridiculously good character development, a couple that was worth fighting for, and friends that just kept bringing a smile to my face. Not once did I find myself bored with this book. If anything I found myself annoyed that people would come and interrupt me just when the book was getting really good."}
{"text": "I like these little short stories... it introduces you to authors whom I might not have known about otherwise, as well as give me a cherry on top to some of my already favorites!"}
{"text": "Gail Carriger is one of those authors that you either love her writing style or you hate it. It is a little bit steampunk, little bit supernatural, and a whole lot of out-right silliness. It certainly isn't for everyone. \n I started reading Carriger's novels in 2010 when the Parasol Protectorate series was brand new. I admit it took a little getting used to, as the books weren't like anything I had read before. The conversations between characters was flowery, the situations ridiculous (in a silly/fun way), and there was an effort to keep things time period specific. I grew to enjoy Carriger's novels and have since read the entire Parasol Protectorate series and all three books - so far - of the Finishing School series. \n Given how much I enjoyed the Parasol Protectorate series, I was excited when I heard that Carriger was doing a spin-off of sorts with The Custard Protocol. The Custard Protocol follows Prudence - Lord and Lady Maccon's daughter - as she makes her way through society and learns to accept her role as a metanatural. Unfortunately, my excitement did not last through this book. \n First, it should be known that if you enjoyed the Parasol Protectorate series, you will probably enjoy The Custard Protocol. The writing style is the same, the characters are the same; everything is pretty much in line with the first series. And that is where the problem begins. \n Ultimately, I felt as though The Custard Protocol was a mere redo of the Parasol Protectorate. Substitute Alexia with Prudence, Ivy with her daughter, and a few other characters, and you ultimately have the entire first series. I was really looking forward to seeing Prudence as a new person and new character, but that didn't happen. \n In fact, if you closed your eyes there really was no difference between Alexia in book 1 of the Parasol Protectorate and Prudence in book one of The Custard Protocol. The powers were a little different and Prudence was more aware of the supernatural aspect of the world, but attitude, personality, quirks, and speaking style was exactly the same. The only exception is..... Prudence is boring. She only knows clothing and fashion. So imagine a boring Alexia and you get Prudence. \n Prudence wasn't the only one without a new personality. Prim Tunstall is attached at Prudence's hip and appears non-stop throughout the book. The problem with this is Prim - while claiming to not be like her mother - is exactly like Ivy Hisselpenny (Alexia's best friend from The Parasol Protectorate series). \n I really would have liked to see the characters be themselves instead of feeling as if Carriger was trying to re-capture the feelings from the first series. Yes, it could be argued that people inherit their parent's traits, but every character was almost a cookie cutter knockoff of their parent from the first series. It was a bit disappointing. \n In addition to the lack of new character development, there is the lack of a plot. The ultimate plot of the book is that Prudence is sent to India to discover some odd, but tasty tea plant. I wish I could tell you there was more to the plot, but there isn't a whole lot more to the plot. There is a subplot that gets revealed in the last part of the book about two groups of warring supernatural creatures, but it is largely overshadowed and downplayed. \n For much of the book readers are overburdened with nonsense. There are huge sections of silly talk about what the proper dress is for an occasion or what hat should go with what. There is a lot of description and time spent talking about a ladybug painted dirigible that farts - yes it farts and that is world-ending horrible. And let us not forget the debates about what is or is not proper for society. I know society gossip/reputation was important in that time period, but this just seemed to be placed there in the absence of a plot. \n Don't get me wrong. I understand the series is supposed to be silly and humorous, but for the most part Carriger knows how to bring in humor while keeping a plot going. That did not happen here. We were left with a good 25-50% of nonsense, a little plot development, and a little look back and hints of favorite characters from previous books. \n I wish I could say I enjoyed Prudence. Carriger is a wonderful, amazing and very talented author. Unfortunately, this book was not one of her strongest. I believe fans of her other series may enjoy it, but it does not have the potential to capture the attention of a new audience."}
{"text": "This book has a very different feel to it than any of Tammy's other works. For one thing, it is written in the first person, told from the perspective of 14-year-old stone mage Evvy, Briar's former student. It was originally made as a full-cast audiobook, which may account for some of the differences in narrative style. The story takes place at the same time as \n The Will of the Empress \n , with Evvy and Rosethorn investigating a rash of dead plants and poisoned water sources on the Battle Islands. With this book, as with tWotE, I was left feeling I'd missed something. Briar, Evvy and Rosethorn have survived a horrific war between Briar's last book and these two. While Briar was left with vivid nightmares, Evvy is left with a reluctance to become emotionally attached to anyone or anything. When she discovers the true danger the island is in, her first response is the declare it the islanders' problem, not her own. Of course by the end, she realises this is neither a practical nor a healthy way to live. The story contains some oddly cartoonish elements in the form of Luvo, the living heart of a mountain (who apparently resembles a biggish, green-and-purple crystal teddy bear which walks and talks), and a couple of wild and playful lava-spirits. This books had its moments, but the extended sequences beneath the earth, where Evvy does little more than argue with the lava spirits, bored me to death. One such sequence goes on for more than 30 pages. I would have liked more scenes with people in them."}
{"text": "They really need to create a half star option on here, because I would've given this 3.5 stars. I really wanted to like this collection more than I did, however its not unusual for me to only like a handful of stories out of any short story collection by a single author. That being said, the first story in the book and the title story are both worth 5 stars. She definitely has a unique writing style, although some of the stories tend to run on too long and then end abruptly. I do plan on reading her other work though as I find it hard to find interesting short story authors these days."}

{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n 3 STAR rating. I really enjoyed the character interactions in this one. I know, it's another YA,but I like reading about Death and how he can find love in a soul when he was made to never feel such emotions or connections. All the rules in this book are confusing to me, but I'm hoping that things will clear up in the second book. \n There are so many questions that remain unanswered--why is Pagan so different? Is the biggest question. \n Is the story a bit over-the-top? Of course it is! It is YA Paranormal! But the characters weren't competely out of control. Most of the situations they went through and reacted to were dealt with in a grounded manner. The humanity in relationsips were more than acceptable to me. I was very entertained. \n So,I just read this again and I must admit that I remembered the story well, but this time I connected better with the characters. I might give the story a 3.5 Star now. Dank's sacrifice for a connection so strong to a soul is endearing. And I agree with Gee that Pagan has a dramatic flair. :)"}

{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n Okay, I think I have sufficiently recovered from the crazy awesome to write a review. \n Probably the first thing I should say is that I have loved this series for years and years and I have been counting down to this particular book since its publication date was first floated, so those five stars are pretty much a gimme: this book would have had to be actively bad in order to get fewer stars than that. However, even given this bias, I'm quite sure that this book is very, very good. \n Although there is the usual attempt to provide context and some recapping, I don't see how anyone could pick up this book to start the series; you really need to read from the beginning. In fact, I went back and re-read book four before starting this one just to be sure I had the proper grounding, and I think it helped a lot. (Also, it drew out my anticipation, but you probably don't care about that.) With that in mind, this is a spoiler flag for the whole series as well as details about book five, so if you haven't read any of it yet, I suggest backtracking! \n A lot of the character focus in this book is on Tori and Jame as the lord and lordan of the Knorth; Mullen the forgotten Kendar continues to have a big impact, and Jame especially is dealing with the perils of being an authority figure. Tori's story doesn't really move forward as much as I'd hoped and Kindrie's story was oddly subdued -- so if you're a big Kindrie fan, this is probably somewhat disappointing, since the big reveal goes about how you'd expect but then Kindrie wanders off out of the book again. I'm all about Jame, though, so I didn't mind so much. (I love that Kindrie's first solution to the problem of forgotten names is to write them down, though! Sensible movement away from an oral culture in times of need! It was a jolt to realize that I'd been so immersed in the world myself that that simple solution hadn't occurred to me.) \n We actually meet some of the Merikit at last in this book. I'd been a bit worried about the potential wrongness of having someone outside the Merikit culture taking such an important cultural role role in the Merikit religion -- in terms of the cliches in the risk columns, the Merikit are bit Noble Savage, but Jame does not come in as the White Highborn Savior. She saves the village, in fact, by virtue of her in-between gender position. Although gender is something that the Merikit highlight and formalize for her, gender uncertainty and nonconformity have been with Jame since her Talisman days. (The running gag of mistaken identity between Jame and her brother reaches a new height toward the end of this book when Tori wanders around Tentir being constantly mistaken for his sister.) I do admire Gran Cyd's solution to Jame's right-hand-braid problem as well! I admire Gran Cyd quite a bit, actually, despite the clumsy device of having the Noyat ambassador insult her to emphasize his place as a bad guy. Part of that is that she took the Earth Mother's word that Jame was the Earth Mother's Favorite for the year and didn't make her prove herself all over again; that's real faith for you. \n Speaking of faith, Jame seems well settled on being the forefront of the Tyr-ridan these days. Perhaps some of that weapons training is paying off? Although she's moving awfully fast toward physical violence, and I'm still not sure what to make of the scene with Vant (especially since its actual occurrence from Jame's point-of-view was much calmer than Jame's berserker flares usually are, for all that her reaction afterward (and Harn and Sheth's comfort) are highly suitable. (Can I mention, tangentially, how much I really admire Sheth? He's a fantastic role model for Jame, Caineron and all.) I also really like Trishien's role in this and feel stunningly sorry for her. The play of politics is getting really complex here, with the Ardeth sinking into degeneracy and madness and the Caineron and Randir breaking free and rising. I'm really starting to need a diagram of alliances, though! \n Which leads me to the awesome glass map that Marc is rebuilding. I really love the details on this. There were a lot of really nice little touches in this book, like the Body-Becomes-Water exercises and the purring cocooned wyrm, and really creepy ones, like the sargent who carved her son's name in her arm or Harn helping his father with the white knife. \n Looking back over it, this isn't a book in which a great deal of plot happens; almost everything which goes on is in the character development and the behind-the-scenes shifting alliances. I really enjoy this, but partly I feel free to revel in this little breather while something big is clearly building with Urakarn and poor Graykin. ...When's the next book already?"}

{"text": "I just finished Entangled and I truly have mixed feelings about it. This was a relatively quick and easy read, with a well fleshed out plot, and the characters all had distinct personalities and voices. \n The cover is fantastic, the editing is acceptably good - only a few minor typos. \n The plot was cohesive, POV was easy to follow and the characters and the plot itself kept me interested. \n The problem I had with it is I felt like I was constantly a yoyo between being so caught up in the story that I had to keep reading, and then suddenly ripped out of the pages by characters acting in non believable ways. \n For Charlene not to expect her sister and possibly even her mother to eat a chocolate was beyond stupid. I mean seriously seriously stupid. What's the first thing that happens in your house when you are baking? Someone grabs a cookie or whatever it is as soon as it is done. At least that is how it is in my house. And for Gray and even her Mom to have no realized the chocolates were the cause? Also really stupid. \n The mother was not a believable character. What mother that loves her daughter to the point she tries to resurrect her would allow Charlene to dictate what classes they take, how they keep their hair, sleeping around, everything. \n Taking the mother's character and turn her into a super loyal but misguided best friend and maybe she would be believable, but that woman was in no way a parent. While I don't usually mind a lack of parenting in YA novels, when her motivation for the action that caused the major plot thread is parental love, she needs to act like a parent."}

The development work to get a couple of the main characters from where they were to where they get to is non-existent. Then there are a couple of characters that crop up at the beginning, are not heard of again and then you are supposed to feel something for them at the end. There's a few other characters that I'd liked to have known more about but maybe the next books will do this. \n I liked the idea, and I've got the second book on prime because I'm intrigued about the story, but I did find myself skimming the book at some points and getting quite confused. I almost thought it was a book for teens but the sex scenes in there it can't be. \n I'm surprised at the number of five star reviews but if this gets people into reading fantasy, that's great.

It's one of those books that you walk around the house reading because you don't want to put it down while you cook dinner or do the laundry. The ones that you pull out at every red light on the way home from work just to read one more paragraph. \n I haven't read one of those in a long time. \n Grave Mercy is another one of those books. A deep, complicated plot that seizes you and drags you under the covers with it. A surprisingly relatable heroin who's toils draw on the very strings of your heart. And an exciting, incognizable twist that (if not a bit predictable) sucks you deeper into the mystery presented at court. You won't want to put it down, and it will leave you desperate for more."}

{"text": "Every so often a fantasy/sci-fi book comes along that just sweeps you off your feet and you honestly don't know why. Obsidian Mirror is one of those books, at least for me, for the year. And it should come as no surprise considering who the author of this book is - Catherine Fisher. \n Catherine Fisher has made a name for herself throughout the fantasy/sci-fi community for creating detailed, highly original novels and Obsidian Mirror is no exception. \n Obsidian Mirror has a little bit of everything. There are the fey creatures, wonderful historic London, time traveling, love, greed, mystery, action, and adventure. Think of it almost as a combination of a time traveling novel/sci-fi/fantasy novel, but its set in the modern world. \n I was unsure how I liked this combination of genres and elements. I was undecided at first, but by the end of the novel I was loving it. It really just came together and worked. I think for some authors this combination of elements and genres could have been disastrous and appeared forced, but Fisher has made it work and turned out an amazing novel which will hopefully be the start of a great YA series. \n Readers just venturing into Obsidian Mirror might get slightly confused at first. In classic Fisher style there is a lot going on, but readers are not given any real backstory or explanation of what is going on. Readers are forced to go with the flow and learn as they read. Everything is nicely put together and explained eventually, but it can be a tiny bit confusing at first. \n Very similar to other novels that Fisher has penned, the characters in Obsidian Mirror are a bit of a mystery to readers. They are extremely detailed and react honestly to situations with intense emotions, but they this mysterious vibe to them. Readers throughout the novel will slowly start to get to know the characters, what makes them tick, what their motives are, and what role they may or may not play in this entire novel. \n The mysterious element, just like the slow unraveling of the plot/back story, can be slightly frustrating, but Fisher works her magic and really pulls it all together. The pacing of the novel, eloquent writing style, and unique feel of the novel really makes this novel stand out from the rest. \n This novel is a part of a trilogy and does end with a cliffhanger. The main plot elements are temporarily resolved, but there are dozens of unresolved plot elements that leaves readers wanting and craving more. Unfortunately, they have to wait for the next installment. \n Overall, Obsidian Mirror is another wonderful addition to the YA sci-fi/fantasy world. It is definitely a top novel for 2013 and I have high hopes for the series. I hope Fisher has learned from the Incarceron series, where it started out with a bang and fizzled out to a disappointing end. \n If you are looking for something new, unique and fun, yet not too overly complicated, a fan of Fisher's previous workers, or like adventure, sci-fi, and time travel, this is definitely a novel for you to try. The pacing is quick, the characters detailed, and the plot is one is not filled with the same old, same old."}

I may of found myself yelling at Mal and Alina at times, but I never yelled for the author to change a bit of the story; It is a perfect end and beginning."}
{"text": "Well, my long journey is ended. I just finished reading the 13th and final Sookie Stackhouse novel. There are a few short stories I'll be hunting down and a companion book also, but I have completed the trek. And it actually didn't take long at all. It is near impossible to put these novels down. The author draws you in and doesn't let up on the tension. Someone is trying to frame Sookie for murder. Someone else is trying to murder Sookie. More than one enemy is trying to finish off our girl. Fortunately she has some powerful friends on her side. But life is hitting her from all directions. Sookie gets arrested and shot and kidnapped and stabbed and dumped by her vampire lover. If anyone ever deserved a happy ending, it is Sookie Stackhouse. Thank you for providing it, Charlaine Harris. There is no doubt in my mind that I will want to read every one of these books again, as well as the many other novels created by this brilliant author. Needless to say, I highly recommend her work."}
{"text": "I enjoyed this a lot; in some ways, it put me in mind of Rae Carson's The Girl of Fire and Thorns. Where Carson's heroine is a bit timid and has to grow into herself, Nielsen's Sage is already pretty sure of himself and knows his worth--but he has to struggle with taming his own confidence and vision of right and wrong to the service of Connor and country. \n What I really, really liked though, was that this was so very far from The False Princess. That book started so well and finished so awkwardly; but this started strong and continued strong. Sage grows, and as readers we struggle to understand the limits of his moral code along with him. We see him grow into compassion, even if it is grudgingly given, and into a greater understanding of his world. It's beautifully done, and I imagine that kid-me would have been hopping from foot to foot in anxious eagerness for the second book."}

{"text": "This is such a fun and interesting addition to the Howl at the Moon series, as it relates the story of a quickened male navigating the complicated waters of human relationships. \n Roman was a K-9 explosive sniffing dog deployed to Afghanistan and thoroughly bonded with his handler, Sgt James Pattson. They served together for two years until their convoy was attacked and Pattson killed in action. Roman was shipped back to his home kennel, and his mourning for James triggered the Spark, and Roman \"quickened\" from his German Shepard body into that of a human male. He escaped and hid until he found another quickened who directed him to sheltered and remote Mad Creek, California, home of a colony of quickened dog shifters. He's been learning how to act human for the past two years, but things aren't generally easy for him, still. \n Roman is nervous about this new assignment for the Sheriff's office. He's a deputy there, under the tutelage of Sheriff Beaufort (Lance from How to Howl at the Moon) but now he's being tasked with watching over DEA Agent Matt Barclay. Matt has been stationed in Mad Creek as part of a network of agents keeping tabs on illegal pot farming in the California mountains. \n Matt is a closeted gay man, afraid to come out and gain the disapproval of his retired colonel father. He lives with a childhood friend, Luci, in order to shield himself from questions about his sexuality, but it's causing more harm--as their pushy parents are expecting an engagement. Matt's frustrated by his growing attraction to Roman, and also by Sheriff Beaufort's constant attempts to thwart Matt's integration into Mad Creek life. It's comical how Matt is shuttled around and openly feared by the residents there, and only manages to raise his awareness of every bizarre incident he witnesses in \"Mad\" Creek... \n Naturally, baddies do arrive, and we have a front row seat to their dastardly deeds--including murder. Roman is injured in the line of duty and adopted during his recuperation by an unknowing Matt. It's so sweet how tenderly they treat each other, and their love definitely grows quickly and strongly during their weeks and months of surveillance. Because Roman spent his early years as a dog, he has no sense of human sexuality. He's attracted to Matt, but doesn't know how to express it, and had been steadfastly warned against \"dog\" behaviors--like cuddling, nuzzling and getting too close--that would clue Matt in on Roman's true feelings. I was both entertained and enthralled at Roman's \"puberty,\" and Matt's an eager partner when they finally get together. \n Expect some heartbreak, however, because Matt's still unsure about coming out, and his father's a meddling meanie of a man. Also, Roman's not sure he can trust another human--he's lost both the men he ever bonded with, one of them permanently. The book is rife with emotional moments, peril and enough humor to keep the pace light and active. I found myself up way too late finishing this one!"}
{"text": "Even with a truce between the god of evil Set and the Kane brothers, they still need to face the fact that the god of chaos Apophis is about to break free and swallow the world. They plan to bring back Ra, the god of the sun, even is the other Gods and the magicians oppose them. Horus has given Carter a clue to how to bring back Ra from retirement, so they start the journey as always: being chased by crazy egyptians gods, evil magicians plotting with demons, and gods that want to over run them. \n I really liked Jaz and Walt. I REALLY wanted to know what was the matter with Walt, because I was rooting for him. Don't get me wrong, I like Anubis, but I don't see how he could date Sadie. \n I still like Carter, and Bast, and I loved some new characters: Bes and Tawaret were awesome to imagine and super fun to read. \n Sadie is just as annoying and selfish as ever, and Carter's whole Zia thing felt a bit selfish too. But I guess she has a bigger part to play in the next book. I hope she develops a bit more as a character, because I liked her in the first book. \n I was really tempted to stop reading after book one, but I like some characters enough to want to know how they develop. I just wish I didn't have to read Sadie's chapters. And that there were more adults that made sense."}

{"text": "I received this book via Goodreads' Don't Buy My Love program in exchange for an honest review. \n 4.5 Stars. This is SciFi M/M romance set in our world with a new technology, mnemography. Mneming is the process of having a virtual reality experience, only a bit better. \n Daniel Schneider, and his dad, Big Dan, own Adventureworks, a small mnemography studio in Madison WI. Daniel runs the show now, after Big Dan suffered a persistent mnem (replaced memory) testing out a program that Daniel had authored. Now, Big Dan can't remember that he's been divorced for five years and Daniel lives in shame over what happened to his dad. His confidence in mnem-coding is shattered and his business is failing. He works a second job for a competitor mnem studio to make ends meet, where he is friends with Larry. \n Daniel is gay, and while guiding a client's mnem, he meets another man in the mnem. This has never happened before--the guides (called sherpas) aren't really a part of the program, they exist outside of it, but there is no doubt that the tall, pale man who recurs in another client's mnem is real. \n Okay, there's some doubt. Daniel is constantly convinced he's hallucinating, or worse--mneming--his stranger into existence. Larry is able to convince Daniel that the mysterious Elijah is real however. And they track down Elijah--to find he's straight and autistic, but brilliant at mnem. His invention allows him to slip into running mnem programs as far as 100 miles away. While this is stunning to Daniel, he's even more fascinated by Elijah. Daniel has never been one to fall for a straight guy, but there's something curious about Elijah--and it seems likely that Elijah hasn't had much experience with sex, at all, not just with male partners. They struggle to connect, on account of Elijah's autism, but the manage to work it out...a bit. \n I must say, I was thrilled by the world-building and character-development here. The world is much like ours, so it was easy to visualize, but the tech aspect was well-done. I really had the sense of the mnem a--to me they seem like VR. Big Dan was such a touching, tragic figure, perpetually defending his (estranged and ex-) wife's absence, and urging Daniel to mend fences--only to be continually confronted with copies of his divorce papers. Tired, defeated Daniel struggling to keep his business running while scared he'll mess up even more, facing his delusional father everyday and knowing his program upset the balance, he makes such a compelling character. Elijah and Larry are two scene stealers. Loved them. My only complaint is: more. I wanted MORE pages. I loved where this was going and didn't want it to end. \n As for the heat, there really isn't much, but what there is is deeply emotionally satisfying, IMHO. I want them to get together, for real. For keeps. They seem like a match intellectually, as well as physically. \n Will definitely be looking into the sequel."}

{"text": "Review originally posted on journeyintotheshelves.tumblr.com \n When I read Cinder last summer, I immediately went out to by Scarlet. I have no idea why I waited so long to read it, but now that I did I have one thing to say....I am an idiot. \n I loved this book from beginning to end. Scarlet Benoit has to be one of my favorite characters that I have had the pleasure of reading this year so far. If I were a heroine in a book, I would be her. No, I would want to be her (because in all honesty, I think I would hide under a rock if I had to put up with some of the stuff she does). I fell in love with Wolf the moment he appeared on the page, and I believe that Meyer did a fantastic job writing him because I felt his conflict even though I was seeing him through Scarlet's eyes. \n I did, however, approach this sequel with a little bit of hesitation because I wasn't sure how Cinder and Scarlet would weave together without the feeling of \"jumping around\". I was afraid that it would feel disorganized in a way. I was so wrong. Meyer weaves Cinder's, Scarlet's and Prince Kai's stories so well that I didn't feel like it was \"jumping around\", but rather giving me a whole overview of what was happening. Whenever the point of view would shift, I wanted to go back to the last one, but then it would shift again and I would want to keep reading the last point of view. \n I wished the book was longer."}

{"text": "Fast paced, full of action, set in a post-apocalyptic world (aka Mad Max style), The Last True Hero is the second book in the The Burned Land series. The reader is taken to the Southwest, with a decimated society that is full of wargs, reivers, revenants, confederates...all of which are trying to survive. \n Adam McClain, a turned warg, was introduced in Nobody's Hero, banished from his home he help build. Rebuilding his life as a bounty hunter, Adam must learn to accept who and what he is. His leading female, Mia is determined and will stop at nothing to get her sister back. Unfortunately, that means asking the bounty hunter she had every intentions of avoiding. Together can Adam and Mia find her sister? Like most of Bec's stories, the characters are engaging with an excellent side cast. If you like Bec's writing style and post-apocalypse stories with a side of romance, I recommend this book. Also, even with the recap of the previous book, I do not recommend it as a standalone. I voluntarily reviewed The Last True Hero as an advanced copy from the author."}

{"text": "It was better than the first book. \n Honestly, the first book didn't really impress me. If there's anything interesting there, it'd be the conversation Percy had with Hades. \n The only reason I started The Sea of Monsters was because I wanted to finish reading the whole series. \n I don't really like the idea of dropping a book just because it's not interesting. I wasn't even hoping for anything in this book. \n But it took me by surprise. \n I like how Annabeth character is portrayed. She's a mentally strong girl. And the second book proves that strength. Also, I enjoyed the character growth. How lesson are learnt unlike most books where the characters moped about how they didn't have a choice and repeat the same mistake all over again. \n I have to admit, what really impressed me was the ending. \n I had a hunch that there must be at least one more of the Big 3 child. I figured it must be a child of Hades since well... he's the only one without. Thalia caught me by surprise. \n Now I'm looking forward to reading the next book. :)"}

Personally I like some supternatural stuff,even tho it's usually about Vampires I gave this book a chance.It turned out to be great-loved the plot with Angels etc... \n First book was a sweet read and it was sad to read how a soul was trapped so long.I liked all the characters,no doubt about that. Shane is a YUMMY hottie and Grace,well,she's a real beauty according to the book.I liked the open ending,i really couldn't wait to start reading book 2!! \n The second book gives more background story about Grace,Angels etc... The 2nd book didn't disappoint me at all.It was better than the first one. \n Y i dont give 5stars is because I wished the author could have added more details into it; for example why shane didn't do/tell certain things and left Grace clueless. Yeah I wished the book would have been a tat longer. However,overall I really liked this sweet love story and was happy about the ending.... true fairytale :D \n Those two book were a real joy and it was nice to read a different kind of love story...some steamy scene are included ;)"}

I look forward to the series but it's too bad that the Sword Of Destiny, a.k.a. another book of short stories, isn't translated into english. Ah, well, on to Blood of Elves! Also I really like how the author had the backstory of Ciri. And the story of how he and Yennefer met.

{"text": "In my Goodreads rating system, I've reserved the 1 Star to books I just couldn't finish. I tried to like this book. I tried so hard. I even picked it up for a second attempt a month or so later when I'd run out of new reading material at my house. I read about a page before throwing it down again. I don't know what's wrong with me, but I HATED Mark Watney and his glib, unfazed, cheerful, \"humorous\" attitude to all of the disaster befalling him. I hated how he would write a paragraph about feeling mildly down and then say, \"Well enough of my complaining!\" I didn't feel like he was a real person, and I started to become indifferent when yet another thing went wrong for him. On top of that, I grew exhausted by all of the mathematical calculations that went on and on for pages. I appreciated the effort at scientific realism, but the end result was just plain tedious to me. This is a rare book that translates better on film, in my opinion."}

{"text": "WHYYYY are these books so bad? They have potential. A lot of potential. But instead of focusing on what is absolutely necessary in a 25+ book series, namely, character development and world-building, Hamilton focuses on action scenes and a whole bunch of stupid, pointless plot that keeps the story moving but gives us nothing. \n I finished this book less than 48 hours ago and I can hardly remember anything that happened. There were a bunch of shapeshifter action scenes, lots of Anita just being a straight up bitch, and what is potentially the dumbest love triangle I have ever read. Dude, the love triangle in Twilight made more sense than this one. Anita claims she loves the vampire...Um, HOW? You literally hate everything about him, everything he does, everything he says. Thinking he's hot does not make you love him. And the whole agreeing-to-date-vampire-while-werewolf-stands-by-before-she-makes-a-decision thing is insane. Do grown people do this? Wtf???? And accepting a proposal while you're half naked getting hot and heavy? Again, wtfffffff. \n This series can be redeemed. I want backstory -- why is Anita so rude and condescending? What made her this way? Why is Richard such a sap? Why is Edward obsessed with killing like, everything? I understand Jean-Claude. I don't get anyone else. None of their actions make sense to me. \n Also, let me understand the world! Every book there is quick mention of new creatures, new groups and beliefs and laws, but nothing is expanded upon. This world is seriously intriguing (no sarcasm). So give me more world-building and less descriptions of Anita's hideous outfits for crying out loud! \n In conclusion, here are some things Anita needs to STFU about: \n The color of the swish on her Nikes. NO ONE CARES. \n Descriptions of her ~ironic~ Christmas sweaters. You're not cute. \n Her pretentious coffee. Especially when she made a cup that she claimed would \"grow hair on someone's chest\" and it was VANILLA FLAVORED. Hahahaha seriously? I've been taking it black since I was 16. Your vanilla coffee ain't shit. \n Her stupid penguin collection. \n Guns and holsters and knives. Obviously."}

{"text": "When Prince Caldwell returns home to his estate, Black Rose, he is reunited with a woman, Ylianor Meyer, who both he and his best friend, Chris, knew as children. Unbeknown to him, his mother, Sophia once banished the nine-year-old Ylianor from their estate, on account of her mother's affair with her husband. So Ylianor's rather surprising return rouses suspicions of her carrying with her an ulterior motive that may not be in the Prince's best interest. To complicate matters further, the reading of his father's Will brings more unexpected news and new problems the Prince's way. \n Chris, now the Prince's lover, is none too pleased with Ylianor's untimely appearance, nor is he impressed with the way the girl enchants his lover with her beauty. But is Chris worried for the right reasons or is there a darker side to his love, which the Prince is yet to discover? \n With a threat to Ylianor's life hanging over her, the Prince decides to take her along on a trip to visit Lord Fairchild. Unaware why Fairchild, the leader of the Council has summoned the boys, the trio are thrown together on a perilous journey of discovery where they must begin to mend their severed connections and awaken special powers before they can finally understand who they are, mind, body and soul. \n Laura Tolomei builds a seductive fantasy world rich in detail where the rules of sex and relationships make for an alluring first book of a series. In a setting that fits the characters perfectly, The Sex pledges the continuing insight into a trio who all need each other, but are still learning why. \n I liked her occasional use of the contemporary omniscient point of view. In addition, Laura's world building skills made Sendar's feudal-like society with its destructive energy a real treat for this lover of the fantasy genre. If there is one thing I didn't like, it has to be the Prince's name, Duncan. Unfortunately that's my own personal taste and bears little reflection on the author's ability to write a damned good story, which I hasten to add, this is. \n I love the characters with their deep-rooted issues, and the hidden gifts they have to learn to use. Where Laura will take this series, I cannot guess, but I know I'll have fun travelling with her characters, as the Prince, Ylianor and Chris discover what their new lives hold in the forthcoming titles.

I have read some of this author's work before, and liked it, but this was not really my style of read. \n Wyatt has been kidnapped, drugged, bound and left for the wolves by his own brother. Despite being a successful lawyer, Wyatt knows his life is now, well, over. If he survives the wolves, returning to his old life is impossible. For some (unknowable) reason, those who have been wolf-raped and return to town become rape material for any and every male who then wants a piece. Hmmm... That doesn't make any sense. Rape victims have no recourse? They will be continually raped? By humans? Weird. \n Okay, so Wyatt decides he'll submit to the inevitable--be the best rapee evah--and this earns him a lot of rape. In exchange for his compliance, Wyatt hopes he'll earn a \"token\" (ear tag) from the pack which will keep him safe from the rapacious humans when the full moon cycle ends and he returns to life in Rapeland. The alpha inexplicably dotes on him, and decides to keep Wyatt's tender bottom all to himself. \n Wyatt learns to submit, and even to enjoy his new status as Alpha sex toy, unwillingly accepting some Alpha blood which turns him feral. I guess it all sorta works out between them. There's some kissing and tenderness, eventually. \n So, there's a lot of rape, gang rape, and this society is all about wolves raping/mating dudes and human men raping male wolf-rape survivors. I had expected some romance/seduction. I didn't find any. I had hoped there would have been some justice for Wyatt against his scheming d-bag brother. Nope, not here.

And the bombshells--even for Kieran, who has suffered a variant of narcolepsy since childhood--are well-developed and plot-driven. As the root cause of Kieran's condition becomes known it is Zip to whom he clings, and she's not too sad over it. Especially when it mean s a boyfriend and date for the prom. \n But the darkness in Kieran's past reaches out from unexpected places, coming through both his and Zip's dreams and straining their budding relationship. They don't know who to trust, and won't risk losing each other, resulting in an exciting climax. Zip fights to help Kieran, but neither of them have the ability to solve this problem alone. Good thing they don't have to. \n Critique: \n This is a well-paced novel with some suspense and elegantly-placed red herrings. The romance reads true and is compelling, and the science behind Kieran's malady is well-conceived. Zip and Kieran are a fun couple, and I can't recall the number of times I laughed when poor Kieran passed out at just the wrong moment--but there were many. \n I would recommend IN YOUR DREAMS to any person who enjoys YA romance...and anyone who enjoys a good YA story. Looking forward to the sequel."}
{"text": "Okay i was a fan after the first book, But now I am BEYOND sold... I am head of heels, IN LOVE with Quinn Loftis's books~ In 2 books she has easily become on of my favorite authors! This had everything you cuold want out of a book (okay maybe a little more on the \"Love scene would have been nice, but since its a YA book I wont complain) ANYWAYS, I feel like a giddy little school girl who cant wipe the freaking grin off my face. I even started bouncing up and down to my husband as I giggled how much I loved this book. I know SAD, but truly I loved it!!!"}
{"text": "This is the second season of the Debt Collector serial featuring a female protaganist. It is not required to read the first season, however, what is IMPORTANT TO KNOW: a debt collector has unique ability to absorb and harness the life energy of a human. One can draw the energy through any skin-to-skin contact, and drawing energy will shortening the life span of the people they touch. They also have the ability to transfer this life energy to others. In the world of Debt Collectors, they are licensed by the government to draw life energy from dying adults and transfer it (legally) to high-potential peoples who can live longer to solve the world's problems. Of course, there is HUGE black market for this skill--and lots of rogue debt collectors exist on illegal life energy collections.... \n WRAITH Review: \n Alexa Sterling is heiress to Sterling Cybernetics--and she's not happy. Mostly because her father was murdered, presumably by debt collectors, only three weeks ago. What Alexa's anti-debt collection crusader father didn't know? That Alex herself is a debt collector. \n Yeah. Alexa has an alter ego as Wraith. She discovered her Debt Collector ability inadvertently, it seems, and it hurt someone close to her. Believing that Debt Collectors killed her father, she is averse to dealing with them. She does have a physical need to transfer life energy--as doing so is a bit of a high and not doing so leads to severe depression. \n So, Alexa/Wraith is a bit Robin Hood. She takes energy from people she knows to have gotten life energy pulses illegally, and donates them to sick individuals--giving them the strength to survive their diseases. It's an admirable use of a deleterious skill, which make Alexa/Wraith an anti-hero of my favorite sort. \n The read is intense, picking up in the throes of a life energy hit. Alexa is creative and utilizes her power in the best way she can, but she's also impetuous, and this leads not only to a bad collection, but also puts her on the radar of a rogue Debt Collector network, Gehanna. She is being recruited against her will--with exposure of her secret life as a Debt Collector in the offing. \n So looking forward to the next episode!"}
{"text": "This was my first Victoria Schwab book and oh my goodness never has an author been more deserving of hype. The book and her writing completely blew me away. The themes that ran throughout this book were incredible and the way she continued to incorporate them was breathtaking. \n \"It began with a bang\" \n The world Schwab has created in this book is now one of my favorite fictional worlds. Set in a futuristic America, the violent crimes people commit have left shadows, and those shadows are turning into monsters. Violent but non-lethal crimes produce Corsai--brutal animalistic monsters. Murders produce Malchai--vampire like bloodsuckers. And mass murders--bombings, terrorist attacks, school shootings--produce the Sunai, the rarest breed of monster that use songs to steal souls. \n The city of Verity is split into two. The North side is ruled by money, safety can be bought to keep the Corsai and Malchai away. The South side of the city has the Sunai, who only steal the souls of those who have committed the crimes that produce monsters, the crimes that leave shadows that can think for themselves \n Our story follows two main characters. Kate Harker, daughter of the head of the North side of the city, who is fighting her way back to her father, to prove that she has what it takes to live among the monsters. And August Flynn, Sunai, who wants more than anything else to human. \n This book had great characters (especially August who needs to be protected at all costs), beautiful writing, and amazing story building and plot. I am very interested to see how the follow-up, Our Dark Duet, stands in comparison to this book, as it is set to pick up six months after the events of this book leave off. This is surprising to me because as far as I know this is only a duology and I was expecting this book to leave on a cliff hanger with a clear view of the problem the second book would have to solve. However, this book wrapped up fairly well so I'm curious to see how she approaches the next book. Now I just have to eagerly await the book two and definitely need to check out more of Schwab's work in the future."}

{"text": "I've been meaning to read this author for a while but finally got the chance during a holiday. Before I knew it, I was through the first five books and wondering how soon I could get my hands on the new release - within a week. The author created a complete and believable magical world, centered around the heroine's San Francisco clothing store, and introduces a full cast of intriguing, fun and conflicted characters. I ran out of holiday before I got to Book 6: 'A Vision in Velvet' but I have it on my Must-Read-Soon list. This is a series for readers who enjoy cozy-style mystery series with a great supernatural twist. The insights into vintage clothing from all eras are just an added bonus."}

{"text": "I'm giving this book two stars because the potential was so good. The character development is a one star - so poor.

Really disappointing as the concept was really interesting but it played out as three completely different stories that were not meant to mesh together."}

He's been twenty for centuries, a Guardian for the Mortals,a loyal man to his family, and he thought that he was in love until his brother claimed her as his soul-mate.

His father sends him away to find himself again; Patrick is now enrolled at Stanford and expected to let loose and let go of his recent depression. \n I this process, Patrick is called out on his ego, met toe to toe in brutal sarcasm, and he has definitely found his match--in a Mortal.

{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n This had to be the junkiest ending in children's books. The bad guy gets eaten? Come on! With so much creativity in the first book or so I was waiting for more to come out of this book. \n They never really explained much to the mother. I also hated that they let the uncle die. For a kids book where everything should be sugary that was a terrible ending. Even I was upset and I'm a good 18 years older then the average reader of this. \n I hated that they had the bad guy pretend to be the dad then try and kill the brother and sister. That would be scary for a 5/6 year old. \n I also found the elves pointless. They did nothing in the book, except say \"Give us the book\" then \"Now you brought it keep it we lied the whole time to you we didn't want it\". It was like every fictional creature from dwarved, brownies, elves, sprites HAD to be in the book. I think it would have just been okay if it wasn't so forced to find a way for dragons and such to be in this book. \n I think this book would have been better if I hadn't had to pick up 5 different books and read it. I felt it was the biggest scam in kids books. \n I also hate that you needed an eye glass to see the creatures yet they capture the mom and all of a sudden she believes. Can she see them? did they spit in her eyes? This is never explained. \n I would not be recommending this book to kids, because I felt it was too scary and the ending was cheap and not a great way for fantasy to be introduced to kids."}
{"text": "I really think this is my favorite of the Forever Fae series so far. I still really love the first one, so it is a hard choice to make.

These books make faeries cool to read about. \n I recommend it."}
{"text": "In the introduction King acknowledges openly the inspiration he found in Stoker's Dracula, and it's easy to see those tones in 'Salem's Lot. \n This book is much more closely aligned with the subtle horror of the original Dracula than with gory and bloody Hollywood horror. The final chapters of the book are the most scary, but the bloody parts aren't gratuitous. There's some language but not too much. \n 'Salem's Lot is probably closer to a 3.5 for me. I enjoyed it, especially for an October read. It's creepy, combining subtlety with just enough action."}

{"text": "I picked this book up on spec at the bookstore, not being at all familiar with the author. It was a lucky choice. I think I found it in the Fantasy section, but I'd categorize it as New Adult Fantasy Mystery. It's got that Middle-ages fantasy feel that allows the characters to be young in years but more mature in roles/behaviours than you might write into a contemporary story, and, of course, there is the magic. But there is also a strong Who-Done-It mystery (locked room, at one point!) serial killer plot that keeps you guessing until the very end. The characters are well-rounded , and the world is fully imagined and integrated into the story. I'm hooked on this series and will go find Book 2."}
{"text": "This is the second book in a series and should be read in order. \n Alec and Cronin are fated lovers, with a big problem: Cronin is a ~1300 y/o vampire and Alec is a human NYC detective. Well, he was before Cronin swept into the precinct and quantum leaped him into a world of vampires. Alec's blood was essential to defeat an army of resurrected Egyptian vampires, but once that foe was vanquished Cronin was unable to turn Alec vampire--not for lack of trying. \n They been hitting it on the reg for two months now, with Cronin biting Alec all the time, and still no change. Not for Alec, anyhow. Cronin's experiencing some odd effects of drinking Alec's potent blood--transference of powers from any vamp he's near or touches. It's all very unsettling, as is the news that vampire covens in northern China are on the retreat. \n Mongolian vamps invading their Central Park penthouse is a dead giveaway that a formidable vamp from the dark ages has returned. And China's famed Terracotta army is on the move. \n I loved the mythos here--the rethinking of vampire abilities and Alec's genealogy and how it affects his role in saving the world. The new vamps we meet are interesting and the story moves quickly--especially so when Alec's life is serious jeopardy. \n Beware: there is a lot more loving going on between Alec and Cronin, though the emphasis is always on the emotion and trysts are short and not-too-graphic. Well, until the end. That was some serious steam at the end. \n And, god, will I always cry at fictional weddings? \n Looking forward to the next book in this series!"}
{"text": "When I started reading this novel, and saw it was 700 pages, I was thinking it would suffer from burn out somewhere in the middle. Boy, was I wrong! The novel has a steady flow throughout, and the descriptions of various scenes throughout the novel are imaginative. The story is told from the points of view of quite a few different characters, from the good guys to the bad guys, and a couple of their animal friends. It has elements from every fantasy novel out there, including the classic tragic hero journey. It kept me interested. I would recommend this to anyone who has read such novels as Lord of the Rings or the Eragon series of books."}

It took rather a while to get started, however; the scenes with her going through the forest alone were boring and I didn't really start to get into it until Gorrann arrived. But once he did, I enjoyed it much more. Very much reminding me of a YA, Queen of the Tearling especially now with her relationship with her father, the new mentorship and the discovering more about her past. I want to see how this war is going to end."}

I also loved that she loved reading, with mentions of harry potter and lotr. I definitely would put this in a list of favorite books."}

Because this is really a scary story. A plane lands at JFK and everyone on board is dead. Unfortunately, they don't stay that way. Let me point out to those who like romantic Vampire stories that this is definitely not one of those. And you should also be aware that The Strain is book one of a trilogy. I'll be going back to the library tomorrow to see if they have the other two books. This one could stand alone but there were definitely loose ends. I want to find out what happens next.

{"text": "This is one of the best YA books I've read in my entire life. \n Seriously. \n It'll melt your panties off, all thanks and shivers to the cockiness that Daemon possesses, but not after throwing you into a spiral of happiness and bliss. Trust me, I'd know. I'm still on an unconditional high from Obsidian. Damn, can pure awesomeness can be too much for a person?? This is my first time reading one of Jennifer L. Armentrout's works (when I really should have started reading it a long time ago) and I only gave into this novel because all the rave reviews. Anywhere I looked, Obsidian was there. Anything I heard, it was all about Obsidian. I just couldn't stop myself from reading it. \n It all starts when the main heroine, Katy Swartz, moves to West Virginia expecting nothing less than dodgy internet access and swanky accents. She didn't expect her neighbour to melt her panties off with just one glance from his emerald-eyed gaze. Figuratively, off course. She also didn't expect him to act like a general jerk towards her. Daemon Black, because even jerks have names, is something special but Katy can't put her hand on it. Neither can she place what's special about his twin sister, Dee Black. Other than being uncommonly beautiful. Everything about the town she moved into is weird. The fact that there have been more than a few missing girls in the past decade is one thing. Finding out that Katy's neighbours are really aliens in disguise is another thing. \n And all the while, the sexual tension between Daemon and Katy is palpable, almost tangible. Everything and anything Daemon says seems to turn Katy on, other than giving her the occasional reason to inflict her inner angry girl on him. But I like Katy's inner angry girl. She's fun. \n When I said I loved everything about this novel, that included the characters, even the main ones. In other books, the protagonists always annoy me with their Holier-than-thou attitude and what not, but Katy Swartz is perfect. Literally. She has a mouth primed for witty comebacks and her thought processes are so funny. \n \"Why are you such an ass?\" The words came out before I could think twice. \n \"Everyone has to excel at something, right?\" \n \"Well, you're doing a great job.\" \n And then there's also the fact that Katy doesn't let anyone push her around. She's strong and she knows what she wants. That scene where Katy dumps her spaghetti on Daemon and Ash= Hilarious. Although I did feel sorry for Daemon. If I could, I would offer to lick it off him, the dirty minx that I am. \n \"That, and you're a human. Humans are weak. They bring us nothing but trouble.\" \n My eyes narrowed. \"We aren't weak. And you're on our planet. How about a little respect, buddy.\" \n Amusement flickered in his emerald eyes. \"Point taken.\" \n Go Katy!!! \n Daemon totally deserves her. Or maybe it should be the other way around because although Daemon does have his moments of dickishness, he really does have a sensitive side. All those rough and tough guys usually do. \n Especially ones that have a smartmouth like Daemon's, and it shows. Have you seen how cute and kissable they look?? I haven't but I'm busy creating a mental picture of Daemon's kissable mouth whispering all those sweet sentiments that I just want to pack up and treasure it in my heart. \n \"I've always found that the most beautiful people, truly beautiful inside and out, are the ones who are quietly unaware of their effect.\" His eyes searched mine intently, and for a moment we stood there toe to toe. \"The ones who throw their beauty around, waste what they have? Their beauty is only passing. It's just a shell hiding nothing but shadows and emptiness.\" \n Wow!! *shivers* Who knew aliens could be hot? I'm actually glad that Ms Armentrout stayed original like always, and instead of going for the overly used supernatural creatures- werewolves, vampires, ghosts, witches, demons, angels etc- she went for aliens. Kudos. Plenty, plenty of kudos. So other than being one of the best books on Planet Earth and stealing my heart in the first few chapters, 5 solid gold stars. \n P.S Daemon's bonus scenes: How cute were they??? I am so glad that Daemon had a reason for the spaghetti incident. I knew he would. And now he's just topped the list of my favourite-hotties and book-boyfriends."}

Book 2 will be able to tell me more about if this is a series that has the Wow potential to it. \n The only con I had was the \"story\" is 300 pages. Why is the glossary 150 pages?

{"text": "I had a lot of expectation since most readers gave this book good reviews -- but unfortunately it seemed like a waste of time! Character development was juvenile to say the least -- though it was fast paced, there was no solid story line to be engulfed in.. Wrath initially seemed like a character to be mesmerized with but as pages flipped, he seemed more like an idiotic, temperamental teenager than the reluctant king! Beth seemed like a big ball of beautiful blob with nothing to offer but to be the bedmate of king wrath.. & yeah, that's pretty much it for their chemistry! The rest of the brotherhood seemed like a bunch of loonies with mostly lame exchanges among them & nothing better or productive to do but be night thugs on the streets -- & butch fit in with the rowdy vampires but he was also excluded from a lot of meetings so yeah his character was another loser in the gang! Overall, it's a boring start to a series -- not sure if I should buy the next one for $7.99! You know what? I don't want to."}

{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n Crosspost: mytokyoblues.wordpress.com \n My name is not Mara Dyer, but my lawyer told me I had to choose something. A pseudonym. A nom de plume, for all of us studying for the SATs. I know that having a fake name is strange, but trust me --it's the most normal thing about my life right now.\" \n I really expected this book to be thrilling, fantastic, and amazing. Many people have praised The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer, but I felt it was overhyped in my opinion. I don't hate the book, but even though it is the first book, I will continue to read the series just so I can find out more about Mara's powers and if there are others like her. Hopefully the other two books are better, I'm crossing my fingers that they are. Lastly, I appreciated that there was no love triangle in this book! ^^ \n The Cover: It has to be one of my favorites. \n Goodreads synopsis: \n Mara Dyer doesn't think life can get any stranger than waking up in a hospital with no memory of how she got there. \n It can. \n She believes there must be more to the accident she can't remember that killed her friends and left her mysteriously unharmed. \n There is. \n She doesn't believe that after everything she's been through, she can fall in love. \n She's wrong. \n The plot really interested me. It was very psychological. I had to reread many chapters over again because at times I couldn't tell reality from her \"hallucinations\". \n Characters: \n Noah Shaw: He was too perfect, and that's the problem I had with him. First of all he's incredibly rich, knows six languages, he's a heartthrob, and a bad boy, not to mention British...like I said earlier, too perfect. I started to like him near the ending of the book, when he finally revealed to Mara that he has powers to heal. \n Mara Dyer: I wish I knew her real name instead of the alias, but oh well. I liked her. I really felt sorry for her and the traumatic events that happened to her. Her life was turned upside down because of her power to kill people. She had no idea that she was the one to cause the accident of her friends and her ex-boyfriend. And I don't blame her for the accident either, after it was revealed that her ex-boyfriend, Jude, tried to rape her. I am excited to continue to read the series just to find out if she can control her power in the other books. Mara's family was lovable; they really tried to help her out throughout the book. It was heartbreaking to read that she tried to be \"normal\" in front of her family and peers. \n Jude: I was lost for words when Mara saw him in the police station near the end of the book...he's alive! And I'm guessing that he has powers like Mara and Noah too. \n Why I disliked it: For some reason, this book reminded me of a Spanish telenovela. There were some moments in the book that were too over the top for me. For example, Jamie explaining to Mara the reason why he dislikes Noah is because Noah slept with his sister for revenge just because Jamie was falling for Katie (Noah's sister). Then Mara asks Noah if what Jamie told her is true, which it is, and then Mara accepts Noah and moves on...ughs. I felt that Mara fell in love with Noah too quickly. I would have liked to see their relationship slowly developed, but that did not happen. I found Noah to be too aggressive and dominant over Mara. Most of the time I was shaking my head when reading this book, and other times, I would stop reading and ask myself \"What am I reading?\" It was not as fun as I thought it would be, but it's the first book in the series. It can get better! \n My rating is a 2.5 out 5 stars."}
{"text": "Absolutely not what I expected this book to be. Much better then I anticipated. A nice light read with just enough well thought out emotional connection as well as action that it was really enjoyable and hard to put down. This is not as great, epic, erotic as her Kushiel series. The first 3 books in that series will be hard for Carey to beat and most readers will have a hard time not comparing any of her other books to them. One thing that stood out for me in Santa Olivia was the pacing of the book. I found it to be extremely well done. She spanned years, keeping all the characters involved, interesting and even the climax (usually such a crazed flurry in some of the last books I've read) kept an even pace. I did not feel rushed at the end which was refreshing."}

He has OCD, multiple personality disorder, and numerous other psychoses that all add up to the rare fairy disease - The Atlantis Complex. \n This shouldn't be too much of a problem, because as he's presenting his new idea to save the world to his friends - Foaly and Holly - they realize what's going on with him and are going to try to fix him. The only problem? There's another plan going on that Artemis and the gang get caught up in, and his Atlantis Complex has to take a back seat as they try a figure out who is behind this plot and what the endgame ultimately is."}

The story is very serious but there is enough adventure and intrigue to off set the seriousness. It is an interesting mix of fantasy, adventure, and historical fiction with a touch of romance (not at all like a romance novel)."}

{"text": "Ok first off, I never would of thought I would of read a book like this ever again. I admit, I was one of those Twilight fans back in high school and I had a thing for this genre of books but I slowly fizzled away from it. I instantly felt nostalgia reading this book. It was a very easy, quick read for 450 pages. There were a lot of eye rolling/hand hitting the forehead moments but it was a nice change from my usual genres. I think I just needed a break. This book was more like a leisure fan fiction in my opinion. This was so similar to Twilight in so many ways that I wouldn't be surprised if someone claims this is a knock off of Twilight but with different supernatural beings. Overall it was a nice \"break\" book from my usual reads. I defiantly want to read the next when I'm in a reading slump."}
{"text": "See full review for The Kiss of Deception at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n So, like The Impostor Queen I found that the beginning of this book was dragging. The author hits you with a lot of information all at once with little to no backstory. Told from Princess Lia's perspective, you're dropped in just as she's getting a 'tattoo' of her marriage vow to the Prince of the neighboring nation (don't ask me to spell it). But Lia has plans of her own. She's never liked that she was a First Daughter of the House of Morrighan, especially since she has yet to receive her powers that comes with that title. She wants to make her own destiny and she does. With the help of her handmaiden Paulette she runs and ensconces herself in the neighboring town as a barmaid. The Kiss of Deception picks up when the Prince that she ditched goes after her and an assassin is sent after her too. When both show up on the scene, title chapters are switched to their names Kaden and Rafe, but you don't know who is who. I had a fun time trying to put together what clues I could to figure it out. But it always switched, just when I thought I was onto something."}
{"text": "I had such high hopes for this book, as I've loved the other two novels I've read by this author. It started out well enough, although I could tell right away that we were in the land of fable instead of the land of realism. The premise, a land where people forget things quickly and there are no reliable memories, made me think of The Dubious Hills. I expected that Ishiguro would treat this premise with great sensitivity, but somehow it just didn't work. He is such a subtle writer that you really need to be paying attention to all the little clues to understand what's really happening in his stories. Yet in this case, those clues we would normally be getting from the characters' memories are missing. A lot of the time I didn't know what was going on, and I gradually realized that I didn't really care. I finished the book because I felt I owed Ishiguro that much, but the ending was underwhelming to me as well. I can't recommend this book to anyone. Try one of his earlier books instead."}
{"text": "This was awesome! It really made a difference with Edward's P.O.V straight from the beginning. I loved hearing his thoughts and how abrasive he was towards Bella in the start. Which, if you've read Twilight, Bella's approach towards Edward is anything but abrasive, in fact the opposite. We finally get to read where he went after meeting her in Biology class that first day. I liked this, it filled a lot of holes and made me understand Edward way more better. Now, this is a partial draft because it was leaked before Meyer had time to finish it, but for a partial draft I was pretty satisfied. I really only wanted to read how Edward thought of Bella in the beginning when they first met. \n For the progress on where Midnight Sun is, writing wise, she hasn't let out any announcement whether she is even going to finish it. When Life and Death: Twilight Reimagined (10th anniversary edition) came out she actually said in an interview she was afraid that people were going to think that it would be the finished copy of Midnight Sun. This is pretty much a sure way of us knowing that we shouldn't expect the final copy any time soon, unfortunately. \n For the actual content in this, it was so well-written. You can definitely tell when Stephanie Meyer writes something because she has such a mature and unique writing technique, it's very inspiring. From just reading the Twilight series I always thought that Edward was just emotionless and had a flat personality. This totally changed what I thought! Again, you really get to see him struggle with these unfamiliar emotions he's having because of this clumsy new girl. There was humour with his side of the story, which I welcomed by the way. \n Meyer really played on the fact the he can read minds. I loved Edward's replies towards the mind's he would read. I couldn't believe how rude some people were to eachoother and the jealousy towards Bella! It was a huge plus because now I knew what people really thought about each other and Bella in the couple first of chapters. Namely, Jessica. Meyer literally took us to the depths of Edward's mind and thought process and it really did change the Twilight experience for me. I found myself actually liking this version better than the originals. \n I really did enjoy this and I really do wish that Meyer would complete this! It would be epic and I definitely wouldn't mind the whole series in his P.O.V. It really was a game changer for Twilight and I'm definitely keeping my alerts on for whenever Meyer decides to finish the book. \n IF you liked this novel, check out more on my blog where I review YA and other genres plus follow movie-adaptations and such! http://keepcalmandloveboooks.blogspot.ca"}
{"text": "Most people truly hate this novel, and I can understand why. \n Where are the fan favorites like Dany, Jon and Tyrion? Well, I think people forget that this novel and A Dance with Dragons are technically one book that got split into two like a Harry Potter film. It might not make for the greatest first half, but it definitely sets the story up well for the next part. \n One great part about this book is the inclusion of Cersei chapters. We may hate her guts, but getting all the inner workings of such a crafty, terrible woman was amazing. She's stupid, but she makes being stupid entertaining. Martin really did a good job with her. \n The next best part was the back and forth between Jaime and Brienne chapters. Not a lot happens in their chapters, but their constant thoughts about one another reminds me why I love their friendship so much. \n And then... my favorite part. DORNE. We've heard of Dorne, and we've met some people from Dorne, but we finally found ourselves in Dorne and interacting with people there. Those chapters could get boring, but the change of scenery was refreshing and much needed (they definitely spiced things up since the book lacked Dany's locations). \n I found quite a few spelling and grammatical errors throughout my copy of the book, and I suppose there as to be one book in a series that falls short of perfection. And while I can't say this book is my favorite in the series, it definitely doesn't deserve the hate it gets. \n Sure, it is boring. Sure, it lacks the best characters. But without this book, we'd never know Cersei's secrets. And I truly believe that would be a shame."}

{"text": "I've put the Connie Willis Christmas book away for now, stowed it carefully in my Kindle, and if it gets too crowded there, it'll always be available on my computer or in the Amazon archives. Come next November, however, I'll want it back there, right at the top of my reading list again, to savor some quirky story of Willis's in the quiet moments while waiting somewhere in a line, while riding in the car or bus to some destination, when a speaker's delivery isn't up to snuff, or when I'm waiting for the doctor to see me. \n Hopefully, I'll use them again to better evaluate my place in the world in terms of the stories and their allusions to history and to myth. \n To me, that's the value of reading great stories: self-evaluation and, of course, inspiration. I won't discard other Christmas favorites: Dickens's A CHRISTMAS CAROL and Truman Capote's \"A Christmas Memory.\" Or even the ones Willis recommends there in her own collection. \n There's something unique in reading Christmas stories with that fantastical and, at times, science-fictiony element that Willis is so renowned for. The whimsy and the easy nature of her storytelling is so conducive to the Christmas spirit. \n So next year, sometime after Thanksgiving, I wouldn't be surprised if my wife catches me cozied down in the leather recliner with a subtle smile on my face reading about Joseph and Mary caught up in current times through some time warp or something, finding themselves in a Christian church where people are encouraged not to get too caught up in compassion, and the two of them not knowing quite how to get back on the path to Bethlehem. I'll be contemplating \"Joseph lying about the baby being his, and the wise men sneaking out the back way, the holy family hightailing it to Egypt and the innkeeper lying to Herod's soldiers about where they'd gone.\" \n My wife will speak to me, asking what I'm reading, and I'll say, \"We are all capable of murder. It's in our genes.\" She'll say, \"Boy, you're getting in the Christmas spirit, aren't you?\" and I'll say, \"You know, 'the story of the Second Coming was a single narrative, but it was actually a hodgepodge of isolated scriptures.'\" \n About that time, the electronic file on my Kindle will magically disappear. It had its origins in Connie Willis, after all, and she has just that kind of magic in her writing. If you've read this book, you know what I mean."}
{"text": "Due to my absolute adoration of Guild Hunter #1, Angels Blood, I have to admit that I have long put off reading the second entry in the series. How could Singh top the spark between vampire hunter Elena and wicked and seductive alpha archangel Raphael? And the ending to the first book, the one I've read over and over again...how could another book possibly compete? \n Well, I'm glad I finally succumbed to temptation, because this scrumptious book kept my love for Elena and Raphael alive. Steam still rises off the page, the political world Singh created gets even more complex, the suspense is chilling and Elena's background and her relationship with Raphael gets more intricate and well-developed. \n I have learned my lesson. Never doubt Nalini Singh."}

{"text": "I want a Sigrud for my birthday. :) \n While this started out a little slow for me, I definitely got my interest piqued about 1/4 of the way in. I was hoping for a steampunky/post apocalyptic/ high fantasy type of thing, and felt like it was more of a murder mystery/political espionage type of story. But the combination of both elements in a fantastic world with deep, detailed, and interesting, once explored, lore and scenery makes this book a definite must read. \n The characters are wonderful, Shara as a real heroine that's a -person,- not an archetype, not a mouse, not a lion. She's book smart, people smarter, and isn't afraid to ask for help, since she often finds herself in trouble because of her ambitions and good intentions. Her interpersonal play with other characters really makes her shine as an unlikely heroine in a screwed up world where everything seems against her by default. \n Sigurd is why I continued on with this book even when it got a little slow for me. Something about a gigantic, one eyed, scarred and possibly insane Northman who seems perfectly alright with being as violent as necessary just makes me giddy. His depth and character reveals are heartbreaking, his snark and ability to get the more gruesome aspects of Shara's job done in an almost amusingly nonchalant manner, makes me adore him in every way. I hope there's more of him to come in the series. \n Reading this, it felt almost like a political/religious/race commentary, which I liked. It illustrates the injustice and inequality of history, of being conquered, and then conquering, of how trying to maintain the status quo and the extremist reaction thereafter can lead to the very revolution both sides are beyond not ready to face. And the six divinities of this world are incredibly fascinating. Only four of the six are really explored in depth, and I'd be interested in a prequel focused solely upon the Divinities. Maybe that's an ace up the sleeve for continuation? Hm? (Please?)"}

{"text": "I'm going to start out by saying that I loved this book, but I also enjoyed Twilight (the first novel at least), and if you didn't enjoy the original Twilight, you probably wouldn't enjoy reading this one either. \n The reason I liked this retelling so much was because of the fact that Meyer was actively writing it to break gender roles, which are what bothered me the most about the original Twilight books. \n Life and Death tells the exact same story as the original Twilight, but with a completely genderswapped set of characters. This creates an interesting plot that is extremely unusual for any young adult book today: a male character is constantly being saved from female characters, by female characters. I liked that about the book. I also liked the way the male Bella viewed the female Edward. He was never embarrassed or intimidated by her obviously superior strength. \n The problems of two teenagers falling in love way too fast are still there, but Meyer didn't set out to change the story, just the characters, and overall I liked the direction she took."}
{"text": "Fanged novels aren't really something I liked to read. Mostly because the characters affected by vampirism in these type of novels are always \"all-powerful\", puissant and practically invincible in some cases. *cough-cough-Twilight-series-cough-cough* And it's the same with the Black Brotherhood series. All the male vampires are big, powerful, strong, bad-ass sex legends. Put simply, becoming a vampire is the best thing you can hope for! \n \"You've won the evolutionary lottery: You're a vampire. Let's go to Disneyland!\" \n I have to cut these vampires some slack though. At least they're not stone-hard and near indestructible. *cough-cough-Twilight-series-cough-cough* They can be killed and none of them are utterly perfect. Yeah, they are superior to humans in some aspects in the Black Brotherhood world but it's not ludicrously overdone. So bravo, Ms Ward. \n I also liked how the vampires in the brotherhood are not fucking pansies who abstain from giving into their nature in some attempt to cling onto their \"humanity\" embrace their true nature as well as not killing everyone they meet because of bloodlust or because they're just fucking insane being the guardians of their society. They kill and dispatch anyone who dares to hinder their path but provides help to anyone who should ask for it. \n Another thing I liked about Dark Lover were the interactions between the Brotherhood. Forget the romance between Beth and Wrath; I want a reality T.V show solely based around the Brotherhood. They're fucking awesome! \n Now onto the sex scenes: \n Dominance in sex scenes is hot but there were a few times when Wrath was toeing the line a little bit. I was surprised with how quickly a hot sex scene can turn icky. \n Classic example below. Ignore how basic my thought process is.: \n \"I can smell the sex coming off you right now.Mmmmm-yummy-can-you-smell-me-even-through-the-pages? \n I could take you down on this sidewalk and be up that skirt of yours in a heartbeat.It's-getting-hot-hot-hot! \n And you wouldn't fight me, would you?\"Wouldn't-want-to-fight-you-in-the-first-place \n Now, we can be civilized and wait until we get home.What-remarkable-restraint-you-have-there-god-you're-so-sexy \n Or we can get down to it right here. Here?-Umm-I-don't-feel-too-good-about-this-Are-you-sure-this-is-even-hygienic? \n Either way, I'm dying to come inside of you again, and you're not going to say no.\"Wait-what-the-fuck-did-he-say?-Gulp-Please-let-me-say-no-lemme-say-no \n Life Lesson No 367: Sex scenes can get icky quite quickly. \n The whole storyline seemed a little bland to me. It felt like there was more smut than substance but Dark Lover is an erotic romance. Can't complain. \n But overall: nice world-building, scorching sex scenes, then icky sex scenes, playtime with the Brotherhood yay!!, then some nice villain-alone time. Because the villains always need a whole chapter to ruminate over past evil deeds or contemplate new evil deeds. \n As a sidenote, I get that the lesser society is going to come into play at some point and Mr. X will probably be some type of game-changer. But right now? They don't seem very relevant. In fact, they're kind of a creep factor. Maybe they're meant to be like that? I don't know, I'm shutting of my brain cells. I'll think about them later in the series when they provide some actual plot to the story."}
{"text": "Great read if you want an abridged and slightly inaccurate yet humorous telling of the stories of some Greek heroes. I was pleasantly surprised to see as many female stories as there were. Uncle Rick Riordan also includes themes of consent and feminism so good job and kudos to him. The humor wasn't overbearing like I thought it'd be either, so yay. \n I really enjoyed Otrera, Atalanta, Cyrene, and Orpheus's stories the most. Also, I still hate Jason. Medea's real story makes her a lot more sympathetic than as was portrayed here, but then again I suppose it was Jason's story."}
{"text": "Wow. This was a wild ride. It hit all the right notes (disability, gender, bisexuality, class and race). I particularly appreciated that the f/f romance wasn't forbidden because it was f/f (it never comes up, not even from the point of view of the Earth-bound narrator) but instead because it was a cross-class situation where the love interest was a noble. \n Nolan's disability is a bit complicated, but for me it didn't matter that it was magical in origin. He's just as affected as someone with neurologically caused seizures and has dealt with what that's done to his life for all of 17 years, plus because of the magic seizures he's lost one of his feet and is therefore physically disabled. Plus, even though astrally projecting yourself into another body in another world might seem like a superpower, Nolan never experiences it as positive or benefits from it. With the right pills, he's able to control his 'ability' to an extent, but he's never anything other than plagued by it. Disability as a metaphor, or as actually!magical (Percy Jackson's dyslexia) is a dangerous trope to play wit but Duyvis has played and won as far as I'm concerned. \n The ending was a little short, all in all, but it can't detract from all that came before, and conceptually I thought the storyteller format was lovely."}
{"text": "Nate Black is a 22 y/o empath trying to make it on his own in a Houston suburb. He's got some family, but they're all crazier than him, and he knows from crazy. Theo, his estranged twin, has more powerful empathic gifts and moved to NYC shortly after high school ended, but Nate's hidden his empath abilities nearly his whole life, like their mother--who went crazy and killed herself--had instructed. Nate wants to fly under the radar, but he's overcome by a vision of Theo being drowned, in a way that's totally sketchy, and he knows his brother is dead. The only way to discover the truth behind it: head to NYC. Only Nate has barely a few hundred dollars to his name, and his big idea--to hitch his way from Texas--isn't the smartest. \n Trent is a graduate student living in LA and driving home the southern route so he can visit friends in Houston. This has him crossing paths with Nate twice. The second time, he offers Nate a ride. Along the several days ride, Trent and Nate develop a connection, which is far stronger than Nate has ever experienced. Though Trent has never had sexual relations with a man, he believes himself to be bisexual, and he wants some intimacy with Nate. Nate's attracted to Trent, too, but he's used to walling himself off from everyone to keep their emotions out of his head. So, both are reluctant to make the first move. Not that it doesn't happen, because it does, but this isn't a traditional romance. What happens in New Orleans, though, doesn't stop when the trip ends. \n Still, once they reach the bright lights of NYC, Nate goes his own way, promising to keep in touch with Trent. Nate knows he needs to touch base with Theo's closest friends if he wants to learn the truth, and he doesn't want to involve Trent in what might be dangerous. Plus, Trent doesn't know about the empath community and Nate's afraid Trent will balk if he thinks Nate is somehow using his gift to influence Trent into being gay-for-him. Connecting with Theo's pals alerts The Community that Nate's on the scene, however. \n The Community is a hidden network of empaths and telepaths in the NYC area. Nate had no idea of the scope, what with his sheltered rural Texas life, but he's appropriately wary of the cadre of folk who want his loyalty and service. The more Nate learns, the more sinister things seem, and he reaches out to Trent for some normalcy, and insight, because Trent is truly the only person he feels he can trust. I really liked the twists and turns of this one. Expect it to morph into a thriller near the end. More empaths have gone missing/dead than just Theo, and Nate's put himself on a path that is far from safe by poking through the hornet's nest of intrigue that is The Community. As a reader, it was hard to know from what corner the danger came, and that's a testament to the fantastic writing here. The romance is not formulaic, and was all the more interesting due to the odd circumstances. Also, it was freaking unbelievably hot when Trent and Nate got it on. Nate's empathic abilities grow, and he's able to experience his and Trent's lust, and turn that back on them--creating a chemistry that is downright combustible. \n I'm so looking forward to the next book in the series!! I received a review copy via NetGalley."}

He also successfully manages to inject some smart gallows humor into this grim, gory story. \n I liked this book a lot. It was highly entertaining and it felt fresh and original. The flashback chapters provided great background information and character development. I really liked how Hawkins treated the concept of godhood; both how he chronicles the acquisition of power and how living with such power would warp a person emotionally, mentally and (in some cases) physically. There isn't much of a cohesive plot until the last third of the book but the world building and the characters are interesting enough that the book never drags. And when everything finally comes together the conclusion is so satisfying. \n I would recommend this highly to non-squeamish readers."}

This is definitely living up to the promise of the first book, although it's a bit more straightforward; I may be somewhat forgiving because it definitely has a middle-book feel to it. Is the series is actually intended to be a trilogy? I feel like I should have re-read Foundling before launching into this, because it follows quite directly from the first book character-arc-wise as well as time-wise. (There's a massive glossary in the appendix in the back -- seriously, massive: the appendix is a hundred pages long! -- but I generally don't find that sort of thing helpful for characterization.) I may have to buy both of these books and keep them on hand for when the third one comes out, in fact."}
{"text": "I don't know what it is but everything I read lately I LOVE!! You should all read it!"}
{"text": "I thoroughly enjoyed all 570 pages of this book, even as I got to the end and realized the larger story was just beginning. This book tells three intertwined tales. One is about the Trojan War as observed by Thomas Hockenberry, a 20th-century Iliad scholar who has been brought through time, along with many other scholars, to observe the events of the battle between the Greeks and Trojans and report on the accuracy of Homer's version of the story. Since I've only read selections of the Iliad and am never that interested in war stories, this was the least interesting part of the novel for me. \n However, I was thoroughly intrigued by the two other stories. One is the tale of Daeman, a very spoiled man-child who lives on an earth of the far future where humans have no disease, no hardship, and therefore no purpose. When Daeman goes to visit his cousin, Ada, in vague hopes of seducing her, he gets drawn into an adventure that he is in no way ready for, and he ends up learning a lot about himself and the value of human life. \n The last thread is the story of two literature-loving robots, Mahnmut and Orphu, who join an interplanetary expedition and get way more than they bargained for. (Despite being made out of metal, these two are the most recognizably human characters in the book, maybe because of all the hours they have spent studying Shakespeare and Proust.) When Orphu is badly damaged in an accident that kills the rest of their party, Mahnmut goes to heroic lengths to save and protect him. \n In the face of this setback, the robot friends decide to continue the expedition's mission, despite the fact that neither of them understands exactly what it is. \n Since this book ends in the middle of the story and I haven't read the sequel yet, it's hard to say exactly what Simmons' point is here, but definitely he's writing about what really matters in this life. While the Greeks and Trojans bluster and strut, and the pampered future humans enjoy their bread and circuses, the two parties of adventurers are learning about the values of friendship, teamwork, and self-sacrifice. I know who I would rather emulate!"}

The Tome of the Undergates has been recovered, and yet the gates of hell remain closed. Lenk and his five companions set sail to bring the accursed relic away from the demonic reach of Ulbecetonth, the Kraken Queen. But after weeks at sea, tensions amidst the adventurers are rising. Their troubles are only beginning when their ship crashes upon an island made of the bones left behind from a war long dead. \n And it appears that bloodthirsty alien warrior women, fanatical beasts from the deep, and heretic-hunting wizards are the least of their concerns. Haunted by their pasts, plagued by their gods, tormented by their own people, and gripped by madness personal and peculiar, their greatest foes may yet be themselves. \n Critics of the first book lamented that the characters were too thinly sketched, the bulk of the book being taken up by some longer than usual action scenes. In this second volume, Sykes flips that expectation on us. We delve deeper into each of the characters, getting more tantalizing glints of their depth and background as they recover on the island of the dead. To be sure, while the first book was a book of struggling, this second volume gives us a better understanding on why each of our characters - and I don't just mean our protagonists - are struggling and what it is they are trying to achieve. Which in the case of our (un)lucky band of adventurers is largely what they are struggling to run away from. \n The problem, of course, is that we spend most of the book introspecting the characters, their flaws, backgrounds, motives, and favorite past times that we never quite make any headway in the story. In fact, the only real progress in the books is delivered by two new characters that are external to the adventurer party, one a librarian (don't snicker, librarians can kick your butt) on a mission to step any who use magic without paying the price (Oh Netherlings...), and the other who is commonly known as the Moth, a vassal of the Deep Shriek sent out to release the Father. The story advances under the stewardship of these two characters, but they have scenes too far and few between to give the rest of the novel momentum. \n And this is why the second volume of a series usually drags. The first volume hit us with such force and speed, the second volume had a bar set higher than it could reasonably achieve. \n And yet I will still recommend this book to you. It was a well written and fine addition to the series, with all the Shict loving you can handle. Hopefully in volume three, now that we understand what compels most of the POV characters in such detail already, we will return to the tour de force that was book one, but with a better understanding and appreciation of what is driving Lenk and his merry band."}

Non posso assolutamente farlo. \n Quindi prendete questa recensione per quello che e \"Un mix di Fangirl e Lettrice con hearthbreker\", perche la cara Cassie questa volta per la sottoscritta ha fatto il botto. \n In questo periodo della mia vita cerco evasione, voglio respirare aria non contaminata dalla realta, esigo di volare letteralmente in un altro posto... \n Con The dark Artifice Cassie ha portato una ventata d'aria fresca nel mondo del fantasy, riuscendo a sorprendermi ancora una volta. \n Questa Clare scrive in un modo piu maturo, nitido, originale e riesce a creare un nuovo universo shadowhunters dove i personaggi hanno una perfetta collocazione, e un evoluzione caratteriale molto credibile. \n La citta degli angeli fa da sfondo ad un mondo di magia nera, riti sacrificali e indizi forvianti architettati da una mente ingegnosa tanto quanto ingannevole... \n Proprio un indizio inneschera una serie di eventi che porteranno alla scoperta di una verita crudele, ingiusta e ingiustificabile. \n Aldila della trama, che ho trovato costruita veramente ad arte attorno ai personaggi, quello che mi ha conquistata subito e stata l'impeccabile caratterizzazione dei protagonisti ed il modo di concatenare gli eventi. \n La Clare continua a raccontare dell'universo dei nephilin ma questa volta riesce a stupirmi e incantarmi con una narrazione ancora piu interessante ed originale, serrata e crudele, sensuale e dolorosa. \n Emma che respira, brama e si nutre di vendetta come fosse l'ossigeno che la tiene in vita... \n Stupenda, coraggiosa, appassionata e indomita. \n E difficile adorare un personaggio cosi complesso ma lei non ti lascia altra scelta. \n Emma e l'eroina per eccellenza: forte e fragile ed ingenuamente sensuale, per tutto questo l'empatia nei suoi confronti e stata immediata. \n Il mio incantevole Julian, lui che riesce ad essere un po' Jace e Will, un po' Gabriel e Alec... \n Lui e una mina nel mio cuore di Fangirl! \n #JulianSeiIlMioMashmellow \n Il personaggio di Julian ha in se una maturita ed un altruismo che sconfina nel sacrificio piu profondo. L'amore incondizionato che nutre per i suoi fratelli e per la sua parabatai trasmette una tale dolcezza che scioglie il cuore. \n Il modo in cui descrive il suo amore per lei, attraverso i colori e le pennellate sulle sue tele, mi ha stregata completamente; oltre al modo in cui si ostina,senza risultati, a negare i suoi sentimenti me lo hanno fatto amare catastroficamente! \n Questa e una di quelle ship che ti fanno perdere 10 anni di vita ad ogni paragrafo! \n Poi ci sono Mark, Kieran, Diego, Ty... \n Devo fermarmi qui per evitare spoiler ma posso assicurarvi che Cassie in questa nuova saga e riuscita a superare se stessa. \n Ho amato The mortal istrument e The Infernal device ma con The dark artifice siamo entrati veramente in un nuovo e piu esaltante universo di shadowhunters!!! \n Milioni di stelle per la Clare [?][?][?][?][?][?][?][?][?][?][?][?]"}
{"text": "I rate this somewhere between 4 stars and 4.5 stars (I really want to say it's a 4.5 but I just can't...). So, after reading this book, it's safe to say that I love Neil Gaiman's writing style. The humor is pretty dry and subtle, which is one of my favorite types of humor. \n Anyways, this book started off really strongly but I think it kind of lost some of its steam after the introduction, specifically when Door comes back for Richard and he officially joins their party to avenge her family . So, like, when the journey actually begins. The writing and humor was consistent throughout the whole book though, so that's good. I really liked the characters, and the premise of London Above and London Below is just so interesting. I also really liked the ending, I was scared for a moment that Gaiman would make it completely unsatisfying and have Richard be stuck in London Above, but alas, the Marquis came in clutch (as usual) and we once again get a happy ending :) . I would definitely be interesting in exploring this world some more, whether that be in another book or other media. \n This is only my second Gaiman book, but I like it better than the first that I read from him (Stardust) and I'm very interesting in reading more. Perhaps I'll read his newest one next, or maybe American Gods, since that seems to be the most popular."}

{"text": "Review to come -- loved it!"}
{"text": "I am a sucker for corny epic fantasy books. Thus this book was right up my alley. \n This book is filled with big muscly guys running around fighting, an innocent girl trapped in the middle of a war, and a mysterious prophecy. \n Sure some of the parts had me laughing literally out loud, but hey everyone needs a good laugh or two. I wouldn't say it was so bad that I'd never read the rest of the series, but it definately was a fantasy book designed for people who just want an enjoyable, fast-paced read. That is typical of fantasy books."}

In particular I couldn't quite see where the Brokkolfr storyline was meant to go (I liked it, even, but where was the conclusion?). I also though that the relationship between Isolfr's wolfjarls was going to be explored much more in depth, instead I got a lot of plot and very little pinning. These issues would be less pressing if the next book wasn't meant to move a decade or so in the future (or so I understand). \n Still really enjoyed it."}
{"text": "This book was a great, refreshing story! It followed Andy, a 35 year old man who woke up back in his 9 year old self and he has no idea how it happened. He has left behind his beloved wife, who he is desperate to get back to, but finds he has landed back in a time right before his father died which means he gets to see him again. The events from beginning to end twist and turn with surprising answers to all of Andy's questions. I really loved that it makes you think about what would happen if you went back to a time in your childhood. Would you do anything to change it? If you had the opportunity to alter one life-changing event, would you? \n It was an enjoyable read, one that I got sucked into right away and read through very quickly. Thanks to the author, Mike Miller, for giving me an opportunity to read this wonderful piece, and I can't wait to see what else he has in store for future books. :)"}

{"text": "Check out my other book reviews at my blog; The Title Page \n Just finished this book and... here is my review. \n Like the first one in the trilogy, there are some serious grammatical errors. I've noticed that there is a lot of useless and immature dialogue. Fitting for the characters ages, but not so much worthy of mentioning in the actual book. \n Another thing I noticed is that it will have entire chapters dedicated to every little thing that happens, and then have a paragraph explaining the next few days. It gets me thinking \"What was the point of explaining all that uneventful stuff?\" \n One thing I do like is that, while the book is full of adventure, not much that I don't like has happened (at least so far). In most other novels of this sort *SPOILER* the obvious beginning of this book would be Hayden dying. I love that he lived and I love that so far everything has worked out okay. No one ever writes a story about keeping up a quarantine compound, it's always about the protagonist finding a quarantine, and then that being overrun in a short time from then. I like how this book is more about living in a zombie apocalypse than ending one (or ending in one). \n I'm not gonna start about the giant cliffhanger endings the author loves so much, everyone else has pretty much expressed their disappointment with that enough for my taste. \n Overall... skip it. There are better zombie books out there."}

{"text": "The book had a really good story line and idea. But the beginning was extremely hard to follow and get into. There were so many different things going on and they would be very short stories. I was able to get a general idea and understanding of where the author was going though. But I wasn't able to get emotionally involved until I was 60% invested into the book and then it ended. \n Again the idea the book was written on was very catchy! But the organization or the lack of information was just to frustrating when the ebook cost me $11. \n So I will not be getting the sequel. But I am very glad that in purchasing this novel that sum of the money will be donated to the ISF!"}
{"text": "Magic Study was a fantastic sequel in the fact that the plot was very original and very strong on its own--definitely not the second book slump. It had its own complete arc and I really liked all the world building done in this book. I love how even though this is a fantasy book it touches on so many real world issues and does a great job of addressing them. All of the women in this series are so strong and empowered and I love that. \n The only problem I had with this book was the way it dealt with Yelena and Valek. I felt like in this book they acted like an old married couple instead of two people that had just gotten together. And while I love that Yelena is independent and the plot doesn't revolve around her love life, I would have liked a little more romance in this book."}
{"text": "As I read Fangirl, a book I heartily enjoyed, I found the Simon Snow fan fiction segments perfectly adequate for what they were (an obvious Harry Potter stand in) but not super interesting in their own right so I approached this book with a mix of curiosity and skepticism. My expectations were modest. In some ways this book exceeded my expectations, but it also had some of the flaws I anticipated. \n What this book did better than I anticipated was make me care about many of the characters, even those who don't have large roles, and their relationships. I had a strong emotional connection to this cast. I felt like I had a good understanding of who these people were and why they behaved the way they did. I never wanted to stop spending time with them. \n However, as much as I enjoyed reading this, elements of both the world building and the plot were pretty flimsy and generic at times, which I assume was inevitable given this universe's origins. Rowell takes an everything and the kitchen sink approach to fantasy tropes, tossing in a great variety of creatures and powers in an entertaining but also haphazard way. There's not a lot of originality here. What originality does exist comes more from the sheer volume of fantasy concepts that have been stuffed into this book rather than from a novel treatment of such genre staples as \"the chosen one\" or \"internal strife amongst different magical castes.\" or \"day to day life at magic school.\" So as strong as the character development is, and as enjoyable as the book is, it does feel derivative at times and elements of the world building feel rushed or muddled. \n Even with these flaws, this is definitely a page turner, and you'll be glad you read it."}
{"text": "3,5 stelline in realta! \n Questo libro e indubbiamente uno dei piu difficili da catalogare, dato che non riesco a dare ad esso un giudizio negativo, ne d'altro canto, uno completamente positivo. \n Oggettivamente Holly Black scrive davvero in maniera impeccabile, la storia e molto originale, i suoi vampiri sono spaventosi, imprevedibili, e allo stesso tempo molto glamour... Fuori dagli stereotipi dei \"classico vampiro\", questi fanno davvero paura e riescono ad essere, allo stesso tempo, vittime e carnefici all'interno della trama. Lo stile e decisamente dark, il tutto viene avvolto da una forte componente horror, senza dimenticare un po' di sano humor e l'immancabile spruzzata di romance... \n Indubbiamente perfetto starete pensando... Invece con mio grande stupore, il tutto e stato noioso e tremendamente poco interessante per piu della meta del libro! Colpa,a mio avviso, dei repentini e continui salti temporali che hanno rallentato la trama; apportando, si, qualche sporadico accenno al passato dei protagonisti, ma creando di fatto un po' di confusione ai fini dello scorrere della storia. Per quasi l'intero libro si e sbalzati avanti e indietro, un fastidioso salto tra passato e presente, che ha reso oltremodo snervante la lettura. I salti temporali e la lentezza della trama, per buona meta del libro, non mi avevano lasciato intendere, che nelle ultime 150 pagine mi sarei trovata nel bel mezzo di un fuoco incrociato! Proprio quando stavo per mollare Coltdown e gli svalvolati che in essa si aggiravano... Sbam! La Black, tira fuori il meglio di tutta la storia. Tana di colpo si trasforma da anonima, in un eroina degna di un fantasy che si rispetti, e la storia prende vita proprio grazie al cambio repentino fatto dalla protagonista, diventando un crescendo di azione, colpi di scena e rivelazioni assolutamente sorprendenti. Gavriel, l'unico degno di nota, si e rivelato un protagonista dalle mille sfaccettature, mostrando talvolta un lato oscuro e spaventoso, e in altri casi una tenerezza inaspettata. Anche gli altri personaggi sono stati ampiamente delineati dalla Black, rendendo ognuno di loro tasselli importanti ai fini della storia. \n Ultima nota dolente e rappresentata da un finale troppo aperto, per un libro presentato come auto conclusivo... Spero che la Black inserisca qualche novella postuma, per dare un degno finale ad una storia che sembra lasciata troppo in sospeso e per giunta sul piu bello... Arg!!! \n Per la prima volta, non riesco a far pendere l'ago della mia bilancia in un solo verso. \n Perche questo libro, rimarra in una posizione di perfetto equilibrio tra positivo e negativo... \n Perche se dovessi dare un voto alla prima meta del libro direi sconsigliato, ma se dovessi invece riferirmi solo alle ultime 150 pagine, direi a tutti voi di leggerlo assolutamente! \n Con i miei gusti \"particolari\" in fatto di libri, oramai avrete imparato a conoscermi un po'..."}
{"text": "First off I thought I was getting a retelling of the Lunar Chronicles so I was kinda stoked because I love the Lunar Chronicles. I loved the idea of this entire universe and almost a Star Wars type of vibe. The first half of the book was enjoyable and then it kinda went down hill from there for me. I felt that each beginning of each chapter seemed to have skipped over something or didn't explain something big that happened in the previous chapter. There was a insta-love in this story which was annoying for me. Honestly I feel like this book had a lot of potential but the romance just killed it for me. Overall 3 star rating."}
{"text": "This book is best enjoyed after reading the previous books in the series. When this book opens, Cael and Ash are still healing from wounds sustained in the previous story. That said, they are finally developing the bonds that Cael has long hoped to build. Sure, they had been the closest of friends, and definitely affectionate, but it had never gone past the occasional tender kiss, or cuddling. Cael wants more, and Ash wants more, but Ash has a long history of self-loathing. \n As a child, Ash had feelings for another boy, and a series of tragic incidences chased him far from his love and all the people he held dear. He grew up in a testing facility for cast off Therians, alongside Sloane Brodie. Ash survived the emotional and physical testing to later join THIRDS as one of the first agents in the program. He's kept his heart held tight, but now he's thinking there's one person who would keep it safe: Cael. \n This is a definite hurt/comfort story, with both Ash and Cael working toward the kind of relationship they have always desired. In the background we have another diabolical plot hatching-one which had first come to light in BLOOD AND THUNDER but the full extent is only now being revealed. Someone has been developing a drug to control Therians in their animal form-creating drones with ultimate killing capability and no consciousness or conscience to stop them. Ash and Sloane are among the targeted, due to their history as Therian test subjects. It's a dangerous and covert business, getting control of the drug before it's used, and might put Cael in specific danger, as well. \n I really enjoyed the careful relationship building. Just because Ash and Cael have been close for several years, Ash is stunned to learn of Cael's tragic pre-THIRDS history. Ash knows he needs to tread carefully, but it's not that long before he recognizes that he can't be the man Cael needs without taking chances on love. There's a lot of vulnerability here, and super sweet steps toward coupledom. I think THIRDS fans will be well-satisfied."}
{"text": "3.5 stars - I read this not originally knowing that it is a kind of response to Lovecraft's 'The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath'. Even without that prior knowledge, I enjoyed this but having read over the synopsis of the Lovecraft tale, I probably would have enjoyed it immensely more if I was previously familiar with that story. This would be good for fans of Lovecraft who are not fans of the blatant racism and sexism of that time."}

{"text": "True rating is 2.5 stars but I am rounding up with the star rating instead of down like I usually do because I'm fine with goodreads recommending me books based on me having \"liked\" this one. \n There were things that were charming and likable about this book. I think Carriger writes dialogue well, and her humorous asides and juxtaposition of stuffy Victorian mores with supernatural craziness worked for me. I enjoyed the tone of this book. I also thought Carriger had interesting, albeit underdeveloped, ideas about how society would cope with the existence of vampires and werewolves by trying to bureaucratize and sanitize them. \n But there's just not a lot to this book. The world building is thin, most of the characters are flat, the plot is slow moving. These flaws I think stem from all the narrative time devoted to the tepid romance between Alexia and Lord Maccon. Maccon is the blandest character to ever bland and so I couldn't care less about his courtship of Alexia. Had this book cut the romance and instead devoted more detail to developing the paranormal plot and fleshing out the characters it would have been much better."}

{"text": "See full review for Dead in the Family at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n So, remember how I said that Sookie being tortured was going to have an affect on her in the next book? Well, I was right. Kind of. Dead in the Family is a little bit different than the other nine books in the series. Instead of getting into the nitty gritty real quick, this book has a very lengthy prologue that deals with the aftermath of Dead and Gone. Sookie isn't the same sunshiny girl that she's been. She's dark. She's in a lot of pain. And she can't even get her happy time with Eric - which is a real shame, considering that's the most he shows up in the whole book. Eventually the prologue ends with Sookie coming back to her old self and everything seems to be all right. \n But it's not. The Weres and the shifters are in a lot of trouble with the government. With the whole reveal, steps must now be taken to see if they have to register with the government like the vampires do. The supes aren't too happy about that and are trying their best to get out of doing this. Claude - Claudine's brother - comes to move in with Sookie, spouting some nonsense about being nearer to his own kin. I know she doesn't really like her fay cousin, but man, he does have his moments and I have to give him a lot of credit for trying. Anyway, there is more reason to him moving in and it has to deal with some stray fairies wondering around even though Niall closed the portal in the last book. \n And as usual, what would a Sookie Stackhouse book be without vampires and bodies? Bill is still dealing with the silver poisoning from saving her and he isn't doing all that well. Considering he got it while saving her, she does her best to find someone to help him heal. And while we're on the subject, Eric finally explains why he wasn't the one who came to save her. He was with Victor and he forbade him from going to save her. This brings up a whole plan where Eric, Sookie, and Pam have to get rid of Victor before he gets rid of them."}

{"text": "I would like to start off by stating I am very fond of the original 11 book sword of truth series this is a sequel to and I am very disappointed with this book. This book is far below the quality of the original series. It seemed to be written with the intent of stretching as little content as possible over as many page as possible making it painful to read. It is filled with unnecessary repetition, descriptions, and awkward wording to make sentences longer than normal. There are times when the same thought is repeated three or four times, sometimes not even with different wording. A small story in a large book. If the story weren't stretched out as it is it would be a decent story, still not on the same level as the original series but probably still an enjoyable (half as long) read."}

Tiger Lily and Peter Pan were just adorable together and I loved the fact that Peter Pan was forbidden. It made their relationship so much more exciting. \n Neverland was definitely a magical place but it also had scary beasts, pirates, and mermaids. I was surprised to read that the mermaids were evil, even though they were beautiful. The ending was not want I expected or wanted, I think it would of been a favorite of mine if it ended the way I was hoping it would. Regardless, I recommend this for all ages, it was a great story!"}

{"text": "In this episode of Debt Collector (season two) we finally get the idea just how far people are willing to go to ensure life energy trading continues unchecked. \n Government conspiracy? Yup. \n Callous human disregard? Yup. \n Innocents sacrificed? Yup. \n Debt collectors executed? It's only a matter of time and place. \n Alexa, Wyatt and Zachariel travel to meet the one man capable of saving ten thousand innocent lives from debt collection. InTense is the slasher (hacker) who put them in jeopardy, after all, and Alexa's sure that with a little push she can convince him to undo his damage. \n And, she may have succeeded. Thing is, the kind of person who can--and does--hack government files to \"game the system\" and target thousands for destruction should probably NOT be the same man upon whom you pin your salvation hopes. That level of mercenary activity leaves precious little negotiating room, no matter how enticing the offer. \n As Moloch, and his Gehenna cohorts, close the distance on Alexa and Zachariel, it's clear that inTense is the last person on Earth who'd assist--and the government is complicit in this plan, as well. While it looks bleak, I'm fair certain a bit of debt collector double-cross will turn enemies to allies--at least I HOPE so! \n While short, this episode sets up the final showdown for Alexa and Zachariel against Moloch and the Gehenna zealots. Cannot wait for the end! \n I received a copy of this book from the author; this is my honest review."}

{"text": "This is a book I probably could have read in one sitting. It is not overly long. It is not especially difficult. On the one hand the story is moving swiftly along but on the other I'm slowing myself down to savor every word. It contains the elements of mystery, science fiction, philosophy, metaphysics and who knows what else. A seemingly simple straightforward tale that upon reflection is a lot more than that. It can be looked at from many different angles. The novel was published in 1968. The story takes place in 2021. There has been a nuclear war. Most of the world's survivors have been relocated to Mars and other planets. The action takes place on earth and features those remaining there for whatever reason. Their existence is tenuous at best. Read when published it would have seemed pretty far out. Today maybe not so much. The movie Bladerunner was adapted from the novel. It uses some elements and discards other. They are really two separate entities and should be approached as such. In my opinion both are masterpieces. And Philip K. Dick is unquestionably a story teller of depth and insight. I really enjoyed reading this and look forward to reading more of Dick's work in the future. He was not a one hit wonder. He left behind an extensive body of work for us to enjoy and ponder over."}

{"text": "This is my favorite of The Author Goddesses series. Yes I started reading her Dark Hunter line and I still enjoy them but there is something about the League. At first I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't more in this story, but then as I thought about it I realized that this was one of those wrap up type stories. Jullien's book was epic and there was a lot of action but in Bastien's story we tied up his story AND were introduced to some new players. Because I understand Sherri's writing I can see that this was a needed bridge story to keep the League series going, it's this reason and the fact I really did enjoy Bas's story even with the parts I had read from other's in the series. He needed his 'happy ending' and I'm glad he got it. I hate the fact I have to wait till next year to go back into that world."}

(...) You're also sitting on me, and sweetness, if you slide about an inch or so down, things are going to get real awkward.\" \n Holy shit.. \"Or fun,\" \n YES!! Ladies, meet Ren Owens my new wicked addiction from the Armentrout-factory! \n I don't know what she's doing or how, whether it's now Ren, Roth, Zayne or my favorite alien ever, Daemon, she's making me fall FAST and HARD for them. You've to know I'm normally not a big fan of YA/NA romance and rarely pick up a book that states YA/NA. But with Jennifer's YA/NA paranormal books, I have no idea what it is, but I can't read them fast enough. I adore her young, sassy and very charismatic characters combined with an intriguing story. \n Her female characters are not weak, they've spunk and say what's up; so does Ivy Morgan. She's no quiet mouse, she's a fighter who stands her ground even when smexy Ren Owen makes her inside squirm with his delicious dimples, smile and body. \n She vowed her life to work for the Order - as have her parents before - fighting against otherwordly enemies, the faes. All went well until one night when she gets badly hurt by an ancient fae and Ren, the new one in the Order, finds her bleeding on the steps. \n Ren is on a special mission and he's not exactly working for the Order but he's definitely working on something....when denying gets harder by the minute because Ren and Ivy spend a lot of 'work' time together, working to in Ivy's pants and vise versa is as well on the agenda LOL. \n \"And why do you've have to be so grabby? Jesus.\" \n \"I like the way you feel against me,\" he said. \n \"You're going to have to get to know me better before you taste my cake.\" \n \"Was that an invitation? Because I'm willing to get to know you in any way possible if that means I gt to taste your cake.\" \n Uhm yeah... what was I about to write? \n Oh yeah, I enjoyed this book tremendously. I liked the lighthearted humor, the snarky back and forth comments, the supernatural story-line, and of course the characters themselves. This is a fun page-turner with a sweet love story developing on the side and with Jennifer's famous plot twists and turns. I didn't see the ending coming and can honestly say the first thing I'll click this summer is Torn, book 2 in the series. \n If you enjoy YA paranormal romance with less drama, but some steamy scenes, great surprises in the plot, a plot that is more than a page turner then I highly suggest this new PNR series. \n Oh and before I forget, hands down, TINK is by far my favorite side-character ever! I laughed so hard I had tears....such a funny little fellow - you will love him! \n \"Tell me yes,\" he ordered huskily. \"Tell me yes and I'll do whatever you want. Anything you want. Just let me do this.\""}
{"text": "Pretty good until now, I am still at the beginning though. But I like the way it is written and the characters are awesome!"}
{"text": "One word: AWESOME. \n I'm sure many people will think this book ruins Jane Austen original version of Pride and Predjudice and I don't blame them. Before I read it for myself, I thought that's how I would feel too. I wasn't sure how adding zombies would improve the story. I was wrong. I found Seth's zombie scenes and turning Elizabeth and Darcy into zombie killers was pretty kick-a**. Sure his writing quality doesn't even compare to Austen's (he essentially added zombies language into the original novel), but the content sure did make the book more exciting. \n I loved the original version and I understand that the characters are living in a time when there were gentlemen, estates, dowry's etc. However, when you turn that world into one with zombies the world becomes more vibrant and the characters more provoking in my opinion. If you are a fan of fantasy novels with vampires, witches, zombies or any other creature, than I think you will like this book. If instead of a rational, well though out but unpleasant conversation now ends with a swift kick and a man falling into a mantle, how is that not better? \n I think Elizabeth becomes more feisty, Darcy becomes more hunky, Charolette becomes more tragic and Wickham more pathetic. In fact, I think in this story Whickman and Lydia get exactly what they deserve when in the original I thought they got off easy. Making these changes it like adding a dash of spice to your usually plain meal. Some people think it's better, but some people have no tolerance for spice. For me? Bring on the Tabasco!"}
{"text": "Firstly, thank you, Jennifer, for a copy of your book to review! \n Where to start? \n I was an instant fan of Ms. Sage from the moment I finished the first few chapters. \n The first installment in the \"Guardian Archives\" gave me a sense of familiarity of worlds I have fallen in love with in the past. However, it certainly holds up its own brand of uniqueness. The world-building is so incredible that I fell instantly drawn in. In fact, I didn't even realize how absorbed into the story I was until my dog started howling at the neighbors. I jolted out of the scene, finding that I was several chapters in, just absolutely startled. THAT my lovelies, means triumph to the author who can cause any sort of reaction like that out of me. \n I have also got to say, I am a huge fan of \"Brotherhood\" like novels; for the amount of time that my friends and I spend battling over book boyfriends, there's one for each of us to fall in love with and claim! And that certainly does not exclude this brotherhood of Guardians-- which by the way, everyone already knows I am quite obsessed with anything Angel/Guardian related. So this series is a huge bonus for me! We had a mixture of our deep fantasies of flawed and dangerous heroes, and relatable characters we can nod our head in agreement to many things they mention or find bothersome/enjoyable. The author says so in her biography, that she loves to add a bit of herself into each of her stories. I agree that it's vital in the making of a world that is still so far out there, but doesn't distract the reader from stopping a moment realizing, there's no traces of any soul in any characters! \n Oh believe me, Ms. Sage aced that! Her characters are nothing short of vibrancy and life. \n The few characters we were introduced to from the beginning were completely fascinating from the get-go. First, we are taken through a moment in Keltor's head and experience the pain he suffered from losing his wife and children. Then, he is paid a visit by his \"Brother\", Lucio, and is given a task to \"babysit\" a unsuspecting Keeper, because she lives a mere mortal life and has no idea who she is-- it's time for her to be trained and learn exactly who she is. Keltor is trusted for this task over any of the other Brothers, simply because of his pained past; they know he cannot afford, nor has the ability to fall in love and mess things up. \n Later, we were introduced to more characters who all have their own roles in the main characters lives and the ones trying to screw everything up. \n There were quite a few plot twists and surprising incidents, and things just kept getting more and more intense. I had my hypothesis all planned out for the ending, but was delighted to see things were unpredictable. I am definitely going on to the next book as soon as it's available! \n Some of the extra perks I found to be brilliant in this story was the witty dialogue, there were quite a few comical situations and arguments. Ms. Sage's ability to create such raw emotions through words, is truly enveloping. \n I wanted to reach through the pages so many times to give each of the characters the biggest of hugs. Oh, not to mention... the SEXUAL TENSION?! I live for it, HAHA! It was at times so frustrating that I had to throw my head back and mumble a few expletives, but in all honesty, I have such a guilty pleasure of teases such as those scenes. Well done, Ms. Sage, well done. ;) \n However batty the frustration drove us, it was totally worth it later on. Freakin'. HOT. Just explosive. You'll see. \n I will definitely be recommending this to any of my friends who appreciate superb PNR ."}

I love that Elizabeth and Jane have been trained in the Orient and are a couple of the town's best zombie killers.

{"text": "I received this ebook in exchange for an honest review. \n Embers is a captivating supernatural and paranormal adventure about a seventeen year old girl Ember who is forced to live with a family friend Aunt Ila, after her parents are both killed in a fiery accident that she survives and her brother is no longer able to protect her from the aggression of her aunt and uncle. \n When Ember arrives in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee, she finds out that she is a Watcher, a descendent of angels with magical abilities stemming from the elements. While learning her abilities and the new world of the battle between good and evil, she discovers that the evil may be closer than she imagined in the neighboring compound. Fighting to protect the town and her new friends, Ember discovers she will have to trust fate and stand for humankind in the coming prophesized rapture. \n I have never read Karen Ann Hopkins, although I have wanted to read her Temptation series. So when I saw this beautiful cover, I really wanted to read the book, even without reading the synopsis. \n Ember is broken into dual viewpoints of Ember to newly discovered Watcher and Sawyer resident in the neighboring compound. I think this works well for this story as you really get to see what other characters are thinking about as well as got to see a much larger picture of the events. Although the story was not fast-paced, the slower pace did justice to detail Ember's new world and the rich history of her descendants. I liked the added budding romance as it was light to not interfere too much into the main conflict or become the main point of the story, but it did have enough to create the want for more. \n Ember the protagonist, was a very likeable character and felt very true to her traits, you got the feeling when she felt out of place in a situation or naive in certain situations. It was enjoyable to see her character arc as she not only discovered and tested her new abilities but her own inner strengths and morals. Sawyer was that great element of conflict for Ember, questioning good and evil and that larger area of grey many question. We get small snippets of his deep dark history and past, although I wish there was a little more in Sawyer's story, I hope to see more in the series and what role it might play in Ember's journey and the overall story \n I think Ila was my favourite character she strong willed personality paired with her blunt, straight forward speech made her a force to be reckoned with, which she proved many times during the story. There were times while reading I would question her motives and wanted to keep reading to see where they would lead. \n Hopkins' well-paced, bible versed chapters slowly draws the reader into the history of angels and their earth descendants and the desire for more."}
{"text": "See full review for The Ring and the Crown at: http://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.w... \n I just finished this book and I honestly don't know what to say about it. There were some parts of this book that were disgusting, but in a good way. There were some parts of this book that probably were not age appropriate for a YA label, but damn. Basically, if you like the court politics and history of Philippa Gregory's novels, and the magic of The Seven Realms series this is definitely the book for you. \n The Ring and the Crown is set in the early twentieth century in a reimagined Europe and Americas. Queen Eleanor of England and France has a daughter named Marie-Victoria who has been crippled by illness, but has been promised to Prince Leopold of Prussia in exchange for the war between the two countries to stop. The problem is Marie doesn't love Leopold and after you get introduced to the character you kind of understand why. Leopold is kind of...nah, scratch that...is definitely an ass hat. His mistreatment of women is disgusting, even though Isabelle - a descendent of the French royal line before Eleanor took over - kind of deserves it (until near the end when you realize why she acts like she does). Marie loves Gill, a member of the Queen's Guard who is assigned to protect her, and plans to run away with him with a little help from her friend Aelwyn - a member of the magic race, who's father is the queen's Merlin. \n And just when you think you've got the cast of characters figured out, there are few more added into the mix. Leopold's brother - Wolf, who is just amazing - and then a young woman from New York, Ronan who comes to England for the season looking for a husband to save her family from poverty."}

{"text": "In this episode of Debt Collector season two, Alexa/Wraith is fighting to save herself, and Zachariel, from the debt collectors of Gehenna, by seeking shelter with...a debt collector. \n Their escape from Gehenna's underground lair is dogged by Alexa's knowledge that the two people in her life who hold her heart--Miral and Wyatt--will not be happy with the fact that they are in grave danger, and that Alexa's a debt collector. But she can't keep her secret and keep them safe, so she bares all, and faces their judgment. \n We get more than a cameo from our old Season One friend, Lirium, whose unique ability to heal might just put Zachariel back together again. And, their brief respite in Madam A's brothel/clinic grants them the space and resources to assess the extent of Gehenna's big plan. If they can't stop it, could be that thousands will die on the morrow. No pressure. \n This \"calm\" before the storm is as deceptive as it looks. Licking wounds and prepping for battle is all that Alexa takes time for, and her new allies seem perfectly positioned to help, if only they can reach the one man who may be able to help. And, convince him to choose to aid them at all. \n A great lead-in to the big showdown. Lirium will hopefully be instrumental in cutting Moloch's world domination plans short. And it would be grand to see Alexa get her revenge for not only her lost life, but her father's. Can't wait to see how it ends! \n I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for my honest review."}

Mannon grew on me a lot more then the other books. She honestly wasn't a character that I jumped in my seat to read about but I've got a lot more respect for her now. A lot of characters grew on me more in this book then the previous ones and I liked that Maas let us get to know the characters a lot more then the previous books.

I know that some people are somewhat or very unhappy about Rowan and Aedion but I'm a total fan of them although it seemed like a lot of PDA in this book. Dorian seemed so different in this book. I'm not sure what word describes him but he's gotten more....well I don't think feisty is the right word but that's the only word that comes to mind at the moment for one reason mainly. Mainly because of Manon. Also is it just me or does Dorian seem like a different person when he's with her? There wasn't that much conversation between him and Aelin which is kind of unusual compared to the previous books.And I was surprised that characters from the Assassins Blade short stories showed up. I haven't read a lot of books where characters from excerpts show up in the main series as important characters. The last 20% was so intense and an emotional roller coaster. My jaw was dropped the majority of that time. Lol Aelin never ceases to amaze me and surprise me. Even when your in her POV you still don't quite know what she knows or is thinking. And also finding out things that happened in previous books that we weren't aware of until now. And especially when Rowan and Aelin get married two days before or that Aelin knew that Rowan was her mate for a while but didn't tell him reminds me of A Court of Mist And Fury. There are so many things I could say about this book but the only word I can say about the ending is.....well I can't say because that would ruin the book for those who haven't read the book yet. ;) All that I have to say is this book was so worth reading and people should maybe put aside their preferences in characters and give this book a chance. Just a suggestion. Five star book hands down. Can't wait until the next book!!! :D"}
{"text": "The Lord of the Rings Trilogy has sold an estimated 350m copies (more if you include The Hobbit), and is one of the best selling fictional series for adults of all time. I have enjoyed several trips through Middle-earth and highly recommend the trilogy as classic literature. I have posted reviews of the Hobbit, the series prequel, and each of the three books. You can click through each review, or, if you want an overview, here are my highlights: \n From my Hobbit review: \n \"Tolkien himself is an interesting study and the subject of several biographies. From his early life in South Africa to the loss of his parents at a young age to his academic achievements, he famously overcame quite a bit for an Englishman of quiet domesticity. An intellectual, he transformed teaching and understanding of Beowolf and also published fantasy stories for children. His professorship at Oxford, transformation friendship with C.S. Lewis, participation in the writer's guild The Inklings, and international fame that came from his creation of Middle-Earth propelled him further into the limelight. Having not read a biography on him at this time, post in comments any that you would recommend and why you liked them.\" \n From my The Fellowship of the Ring review: \n \"The Peter Jackson movie on this title was not only a huge success, but a mostly faithful account of the story line, language, history and settings of Middle-earth. Of course, the book is better, and sales indicate many were lead to discover the text either in preparation for or to continue exploration after the movie was released. This is a huge win, because not only was this book a best seller, it represents some of the finest fictional writing in the English language and deserves it's status as an enduring classic. If you've only watched the movie, take the plunge!\" \n From my Two Towers review: \n \"When I started researching for this review, I was shocked to discover that after publishing The Fellowship of the Ring (Lord of the Rings, Book #1) in July of 1954, Tolkien delivered Two Towers FOUR MONTHS later in November of the same year. Certainly, he had a lot written before Fellowship was published, after all there were some 17 years between the first Middle-earth installment of The Hobbit and The Fellowship of the Ring, but this still struck me as a tremendous achievement. The Return of the King came out eight months later the following year in July of 1955. This was probably possible because Tolkien wrote them all as one story. As such, Two Towers doesn't seem to suffer from many of the difficulties that plague middle books in a trilogy. Instead of slowing down to develop, this installment actually speeds up the action while adding depth to characters. This approach by Tolkien more closely resembles life, where our trials - and adventures - expose our true character.\" \n From my Return of the King review: \n \" The sense of peril is high in this adventure and we see that Tolkien, as an author, doesn't love his characters enough for us to feel confident he will preserve them all. This sacrifice of the good, beloved and noble gives the story a weighty feel. Furthermore, the enduring impact of the struggle with evil on our beloved characters, particularly Frodo, speaks to Tolkien's personal experience with war.\" \n Want to get started?

{"text": "Eragon is a cross between The Lord of the Rings and Eon: Dragoneye Reborn to me which is like a geek's wet dream. And I am unashamedly a geek. It's such a brilliant book- the setting, Alagaesia, where Eragon's story is set in, is painted out into reality by Christopher Paolini.

{"text": "#8 Best Sellers of all time, estimated 107 million copies sold (Source: Wikipedia.org) \n I read this about a decade ago. The level of affection for Harry Potter, the number of books sold, the awards given, the movies made and JK Rowling's fortune have only grow in the intervening time. Friends who adore Harry convinced me to read it again. Unfortunately, I found it unchanged. \n I loathe this pedantic and tedius story. From the Muggle popscicle stick theater characters' cruel hatred to the normalization of wizardry, to the alchemy, I simply don't understand what all the fuss is about. I can see that Rowling occassionally creates an interesting scene: Hogwarts castle or Diagon's Alley, and the highlight of the book was Harry's overwhelming mail which occurs disappointingly early for a highlight. \n Harry and the other characters of the book are simply not developed. What are his likes/ dislikes? He is simply shaped by circumstances, circumstances that seem rather pandering (The people closest to you don't see it, but you're special! You are surprisingly rich! You have extraordinary abilities! You need a #2 wingman/ sidekick (Ron)! Capable girls will notice you (Hermoine)! The rules don't apply to you! You have an exciting future ahead of you! etc), but Rowling doesn't develop Harry's CHARACTER. Other characters appear and disappear according to a simplistic linear narrative, leaving no sense that these characters EXIST apart from their presence when facing Harry in the storyline. Clearly, Harry and his friends were in an elite category, to whom the standard warnings and boundaries of Hogwarts' students didn't apply - and Harry the most elite of all. Clearly, they were exceptional and have incredible abilities beyond their age, experience or education - and Harry the most exceptional of all. Clearly, the adults were rather worthless in dealing with the oh-so-scary-impending-threat - and Harry the most vulnerable of all (due to their neglegence). Clearly, they were going to come out unscathed (Excuse me, I yawned.) \n Additionally, \"this has never happened before!\" and \"don't do that or else you'll be expelled,\" and \"his impeding death seemed certain\" rang false, I didn't believe it and I never felt a sense of peril relating to either Harry, his friends, or their adventures. This is heightened by the mental suspension necessary to believe the children are both unaware that they are simultaneously incredibly brilliant and astoundingly dim as they fail to pursue lines of action that would provide clarity to their drawn out adventure. \n I guess the bottom line is that while the popularity is impressive, the writing just isn't that good. Yet this is the first book/ series for many of the young generation, who read it as children and view Harry as a friend from their youth - a breath of nostalgic security. I'm happy they found that in a book. It's an attachment I can empathize with as I have many lifelong friends myself from books I read as a child. But, I wish we could get children attached to excellent literature. \n Want to read #7 best seller of all time?

{"text": "I'm giving Tammy's \"Circle\" books another go, and keeping an open mind about them, despite the fact that I have tried this quartet twice before, and found it less satisfying than her \"Tortall\" books. For one thing, all the familiar sights and characters of the \"Tortall\" books are missing. For another, the \"Circle\" books are intended for a younger audience, so not only is there less adult-oriented content, but the stories are told in a more simplistic way. Our hero and heroines are only about ten or eleven when the story begins, and the entire quartet covers little more than a year, so there is little time for character development. \n Tammy has also chosen to focus on four central characters for this series, rather than a single main character, which means that, although the first book belongs to Sandry, it also introduces the other three characters, giving their origins, and switching frequently between viewpoints. The characters think of things in simple ways because they are children, but they are not unlikable characters. \n Sandry is the daughter of noble parents who died in a recent plague, but though she is nobility, she is the most open-minded, friendly, and easy-going of the four. She has been brought to Winding Circle Temple because of her special ability with thread magic, and because of her inability to get along with her dorm mates, she is put in Discipline Cottage with Tris, Daja, and Briar, all of whom, like her, have special abilities and nowhere else to go. Though they come from different backgrounds and have different abilities, they begin to form a strong bond of friendship, which, in the end, is what saves them. \n Most of the book is focused on character and concept introduction, and there's not much buildup to the climax of the book. The message is one of acceptance and friendship. I think this time I think I enjoyed it more than in the previous two reads. I would give it 3.5 stars, if that were possible. Good for ages 8+."}
{"text": "Wasn't sure about this book at first, but I just went with it and I'm glad that I did. It was a lot of fun and very different. Albert Einstein plays a role as a \"Neither Here Not There\" Supervisor, ABBA music is used as the perfect cosmic scrambler, and God is a She. This is chock full of lighthearted fun. \n The \"hero\" was my favorite character. Julian is totally bad- but highly amusing and perfect. Come to think of it, I could really use a raunchy, bad-ass, no holds barred evil angel on my side- wonder where I can pick one up? ;)"}
{"text": "I've been eyeing this book by Cassandra Clare for a long time, even before the movie came out. I seem to see it everywhere and I was wondering what all the hype was about. \n Unfortunately, though it seemed like it had all the ingredients for a novel I would like, this one fell flat for me. I don't often say that about a book, especially a promising urban fantasy like this one. But Clary Fray just didn't capture me. And Jace Weyland even less. The book read more like an introductory guide than a story, by necessity of its dizzyingly complex fantasy world. The plot twists were predictable and the prose tried too hard. I wanted to like it, I really did. \"Jace unhitched himself from the railing\" might have charmed me if used once, but the same expression twice or more? And \"he grinned all over his face\" is just silly. \n I probably will pick up the second book and give it a chance, as I am a little curious about what happens next. But I'm not dying to know, and that in itself tells me that The Mortal Instruments won't be going on my top books list. Apologies to anyone who did like the story. If you haven't read it, you may want to skip it and give Divergent a try instead. Or watch the movie: it was much better than the book, for a change."}

{"text": "\"The world is a cruel mother, a matron of darkness, selfishness, greed, and misery. For most, their time suckling at her breast is naught but a scramble through stinging, tearing briars before a naked, shameful collapse as the flesh gives out. And yet in the bright eyes of every newborn, there lies a spark, a potential for goodness, the possibility of a life worth living. That spark deserves its chance.\" \n This was, quite simply, one of the best fantasy novels I've ever had the pleasure of reading. It was dark, imaginative, unique, gripping, and just so well written. I loved everything about it. \n I'm going to do my best to give some kind of synopsis but this story is so steeped in its own mythology and filled with such detail that I feel I might get some of it wrong or do a disservice by giving too many details. That was part of the magic. Everything I read was new and shiny and completely original. \n Ryhalt Galharrow is a bounty hunter who is sent through the Misery to an outpost to find a mysterious noblewoman. He is also known as Blackwing because he serves Crowfoot, a Nameless (one of five god-like beings that fight the Deep Kings, even stronger god-like beings). Galharrow is no stranger to the Misery, a vast wasteland filled with all sorts of nasty magic creatures and ghosts, including the terrifying Darlings and others who were once men. Magic has since twisted and corrupted them but most are held back in the Misery by the threat of Nall's Engine, a weapon that besides being the cause of the Misery's creation has the power to cause massive damage. It isn't something to be used lightly because of the incredible amount of magic it takes to power and the damage it causes. When Galharrow arrives at the outpost to find the noblewoman he discovers that he knows her. Galharrow and Ezabeth have a history together that adds a surprisingly emotional layer to this already incredible book. Together they discover that Nall's Engine might be in trouble and if the Deep Kings find out, there is nothing to stop them from attacking. \n Ryhalt Galharrow would probably describe himself as simple, but he was anything but. He wasn't a hero. He definitely wasn't a villain. While he did many bad things, I would say somewhere buried beneath his bitterness and battled hardened heart he was good. He hated the world and everyone in it, yet he has a select few of people he loved fiercely. He enjoyed killing and admitted as much. He just...was. He didn't feel like a character written, he read like a man plucked from the ether and put on paper. \n \"Pity gets men killed along the Misery,\" I said. \"Stay long enough, and you'll find morality doesn't survive sandstorms, clouds of arrows, or Darling magic any better than flesh.\" \n \"You've a hard soul, Captain.\" \n \"I do.\" \n \"Do you ever wish you were different?\" \n \"I wish everything were different.\" \n He was fascinating to read and I loved being in his head. So simple. So complex. So human. \n While the writing was sometimes crude (appropriately so, it was first person and Blackwing is a rough man) it was also surprisingly elegant and when paired with the horrors of war and the consequences, it was all the more effective and powerful. \n I was glued to this book and utterly fascinated. I wanted to know more about everything. I want a whole book on the creatures of the Misery. I want a history lesson about the creation of their world. I loved the idea of Phos, magic harvested from light. There were Spinners and Talents, both of which could harvest/gather magic from light and the Spinners would wield it. I wanted to know more about everything. We are given just enough information that we understand who the Deep Kings and Nameless are and what they want, yet we are kept in the dark just enough that we aren't able to predict their actions. Basically, everything was done so well. Information was doled out perfectly. No info dump. Just brilliant. I can't recommend this enough for fantasy lovers and I'm so excited that this is a series. \n *I recieved an ARC in exchange for a fair and honest review"}

It turns out a group of witches has come to town and wanted to take Eric's business holdings for themselves. Eric said he think about it until the next day when a representative of the witches came by with a new proposal. The head witch - Hallow - would only take a fifth of Eric's business profits if he gave himself to her for two months. He refused and attacked the representative who had a spell on her that made Eric lose his memory. Until Pam, Chow and a group of Weres find out where the coven is, Sookie has to keep Eric safe, which shouldn't be too hard to do.

But then weird things start happening in town, something of the supernatural variety, not that you know that, you're painfully ignorant. You notice the weird but you're not a hundred percent sure what it's all about. Because you and your friends aren't the 'Chosen One.' You're just the secondary characters who have their own problems other than the weird blue light and spooky looking deer. \n *sigh* Where to even begin with this book? Hm...okay, look I loved the concept of this book. What if there's something big and supernatural going on in a town, but the narrator and his friends aren't the ones who are supposed to save it? Great. The diversity of characters - a jock who's guy and a quarter God (which I will get into later) and a POC as the narrator's love interest - fantastic! But, unfortunately, that's where the greatness ends."}
{"text": "Honestly, when I read about a new Harry Potter book coming out about a year ago, cleverly marketed as \"the eight Harry Potter story\", I wasn't that excited. For me, the Harry Potter-series ended perfectly; with a small epilogue for our curiosity, but most was left for the imagination. Also, J.K. Rowling came out right away after the last book with the opinion she was done with Harry Potter. Good for me. But obviously, when the release date came closer and closer, I couldn't help myself; I got excited. I ordered the book on the 1th of August (the day after the official release date) and dove in. \n \"Ah really, what does my opinion matter any more? I am paint and memory, Harry, paint and memory.\" - Dumbledore \n Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a script for the play; it isn't a normal novel, but just lines of dialogue and some excerpts of context. I was prepared for this; I didn't expect the magic of the original Harry Potter-series, just because for me the magic always was in the detailed way the world, characters and stories were described. You definitely shouldn't see this as \"the eight book\"; it's just something new including our old and well-beloved characters. \n That being said, I actually kind of enjoyed this book. It was fun to go on a new adventure with Harry's son, Albus, and his friend Scorpius, actually Draco Malfoy's son. It definitely didn't feel like \"going back to the Harry Potter world\", just because by reading a script, you only get an idea of the characters. I think seeing the play will be a more magical nostalgic feeling. Still, I liked going back. \n Snape: \"Sometimes costs are made to be borne (..) I didn't just quote Dumbledore, did I?\" \n Hermione: \"No, I'm pretty sure that's pure Severus Snape.\" \n Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is set nineteen years after the original series ended. You start of with the epilogue included in the last book and go from there, following mostly, as I said, Harry's son Albus. You get a glimpse in the lives of most of your favorite characters (lots of them make an appearance) and it almost feels like a moment of closure, so that's what happened to them.... So yes, I really enjoyed this book. It had its flaws, but you should not observe it in the same manner you did the original Harry Potter-books. HP and the Cursed Child is something on its own; a chance to feel some of that magic again. \n Scorpius: \"It's time that time-turning became a thing of the past.\" \n Albus: \"You're quite proud of that phrase, aren't you?\" \n Scorpius: \"Been working on it all day.\""}

{"text": "This review was written for Joyfully Jay Reviews and can be accessed here: http://joyfullyjay.com/2016/05/review... \n The Only Option is part of the Dubious novella collection, all of which include a marriage of convenience. It's a high fantasy story that includes magi, necromancers, dragons, and magic. \n Rochus is a necromancer, one highly regarded for his talents by his Queen. As part of his training and practice, Rochus only has half his soul, and his body reflects this lack in that he's deathly pale, has blue hair, nails, and teeth--which are very sharp, and he only drinks blood for sustenance. He's not a vampire, though they also exist in this world. No, Rochus is a wealthy man, and orders his blood brought to him in a pitcher or cup. \n Rochus is en route to the palace, under the Queen's summons, and stays the night at a familiar inn. Being approached by Tilo, a sexy young dragon, is not his preference, at all. Rochus has been the victim of violence before and won't let a sexy creature, like Tilo, lure him away from safety no matter Tilo's sex appeal. Well, the best laid plans don't lead to the best laid necromancer. Tilo has his wicked way, and Rochus is rather pleased about it...until he arrives at the castle and learns that the Queen is ordering him into marriage--to Tilo. \n It seems that Tilo has some very serious issues brewing in his lands, magical elements that can only be handled by a necromancer. His repeated petitions to the Queen for aid were never received and went unanswered, until Tilo had to resort to such a dramatic request. Rochus is outraged and feels as if he's being made a fool of. While he submits to the wedding, he's quick to alert Tilo that his professional services as a necromancer do not fall under a husband's prerogative. \n Well, that pretty much guts Tilo, and his genuine remorse for all his desperate machinations is what turns the tide for Rochus--and maybe fosters some love, too. \n I really dug all the magical elements in this story. None of it felt easy, or convenient. There are moments of true peril that must be overcome by careful consideration and application of Rochus' extensive magical skills--and sometimes some plain out dragon fire, all of which felt totally germane to this world. I loved Rochus' many pets and how in synch they were as magical helpers. Rochus and Tilo were both well-drawn characters with heaps of integrity. Rochus is a proud man, who's been hurt many many times before. He's older--43 years--and has a lot of trouble believing that any man as young, attractive, and virile as Tilo could ever truly want him. This insecurity is what causes him to drive Tilo off, again and again, and I felt that it was really well-considered. It's obviously not simple age that's a problem; Rochus' physical oddities and profession as a necromancer are not generally attractive, as Rochus' history has taught him, so he's wary of building a rapport that will only end in heartbreak. And, yet, Tilo demonstrates again and again that he's really in it for Rochus, not just his magic. It gave Rochus just an inkling of hope for more, which was fantastic. I also loved the dichotomy of the hot dragon and the cold necromancer and how they were so complementary to each other. \n The only issue I had was that of time. It seemed as if it only took a couple days journey to reach Tilo's fortress--and that seemed a mite unrealistic, considering the other spans that were discussed in the book. Other than that, this is a really awesome piece of fantasy that has yummy sexytimes and two very compelling main characters. It may have begun with a marriage of convenience, but it ends with a courtship and an expectation for an HEA."}

{"text": "The Raven Boys intrigued me right from the opening. Blue Sargent is sitting next to her aunt on Corpse Road. On St. Mark's Eve, the spirits of those who will die in the coming year walk this path. Blue is not gifted with the psychic ability of her relatives and their friends. However, she does have the power to magnify the gifts of others. Blue has never seen one of the spirits until this year when she is shocked to discover a boy her age. Her aunt tells Blue that she could only see a spirit if it is someone she loves or someone she kills. She does not know the boy but recognizes the uniform of an exclusive prep school whose students are known as the Raven Boys. Blue is a townie who comes into contact with these rich, entitled scions at the pizza parlor where she works. It's not long before her path crosses with Gansey and his crew. These four are on a complicated quest to discover a Welch king they believe was buried nearby. After a rocky initial meeting, Blue ends up drawn into their search. Maggie Stiefvater weaves a compelling tapestry with this story but brings it to a rather abrupt and cryptic ending. I presume that is to move the reader on to book two. Mission accomplished."}
{"text": "This is one of those books that once you start reading it you just cannot stop. It was relentlessly readable. The broad outline of the plot is somewhat conventional but the way the story is told is brilliant and very captivating. \n The protagonist of the story is a man named Kvothe. At the start of the novel Kvothe is a humble innkeeper living under an assumed name. He supposedly has a past history of great heroism/mythic adventure that has come to ruin in some way. This book is the first third of his life story that he is narrating to a Chronicler. \n Kvothe is not a totally likable or reliable narrator and it is this continual undercurrent of distrust at the recollections of our supposed hero and the clever framing device that add a great layer to the main plot, recounting Kvothe's childhood and attendance at university. Additionally, this book is beautifully written, well paced, and endlessly intriguing. I love how this book treats magic, and the world building thus far has been great for where we are in the story. Every aspect of this world feels so real and so fascinating. \n Solid roster of supporting characters as well. A great read. Loved it!"}

Narrin ja Fitzin valinen suhde on kasittamattoman vahva ja uskon siihen, etta viimeisessa kirjassa heidan valeistaan puhutaan viela lisaa. Onko Narri lopulta mies vai nainen, se on kiinnostavaa.

{"text": "It sucks being a vampire who wants something she's afraid of; the simple touch of a human. There are lines she's afraid she might cross that keep her from finding that fulfilment, so she's a very lonely lady. Until one night Fate decides to take a hand and deliver unto her the very thing she craves, in the form of two very hunky shifters. Jane has never in all her decades felt as confused as now. \n Jude is an alpha with several things on his mind,not least of which is the woman they've been tracking who smells like home. Only he's not prepared for the fact that not only he,but his second, Cray are destined to be her mate. Now they have to learn to share, find the rogue out for revenge and keep Jane safe at the same time, for this ousted pack member has already killed once. \n For a good quick read full of steamy sex, humour (whether intentional or just my perverted sense of) and strong characters Calista Fox's Claim Me is a fine choice. Jane has the kind of alpha female confidence that makes for great dialogue, while both Jude and Cray are sexy, strong men who learn that sometimes the joke is on them. The biggest disappointment for me was the length (but I always like more than less) because just as I was getting into all of it, their part was over. Knowing this is part of a series I still like a little more in-depth exploration of their stories, but it's still well-rounded, complete and I enjoyed it."}

{"text": "So I am a HUGE Black Dagger Brotherhood fan and have been for quite awhile. To start with I had a hard time getting into this book not because of the book but because I was not in the right place for the BDB. However knowing that Blay and Qhuinn's book is coming out I decided to see if I could get in the mood for the BDB and I am so glad that I did. \n I wasn't sure how they were going to sell me on Tohrment and No'One since I was a huge Wellsie fan and was so heartbroken when she died but J.R.

Even though I was routing for them to be together and for them to be able to move forward there were many trying times and douche bag moments for Tohr. \n In the wake of No'One's pissed-off departure, Tohr decided that short of the fact John Matthew hadn't managed to cut himself on the hand and foot thus far tonight, it looked like Tohr and the kid had a lot in common: Courtesy of their tempers, both were now dressed in the Captain Asshole costume - which included, for no extra charge, the cape of disgrace, the booties of shame, and keys to the Fuck Up mobile. \n Oh and Lassiter I loved him and his part in their journey of wholeness. \n \"Lassiter, I'm on my knees here.\" \"That's because your balls are in your diaphragm.\" \n The chemistry between Tohr and No'One was explosive even though Tohr was denying it. \n Underneath the fly of his leathers, his cock punched out to its full length. Without apology. \n I wasn't sure how it was all going to play out for Tohr and No'One but it was a success. This book also was great with the drama that is unfolding for the Brotherhood with the Lessers and the Band of Bastards.

It's not that she felt God and angels weren't real, but perhaps she wondered if God was still caring and aware of all the turmoil in this world, and in her life as of late. \n Maggie struggles with the choices she felt were thrust upon her after her divorce. She tries to shield herself and her children from ridicule by moving their lives a bit further from where they were. She felt a bit off kilter until Evan appeared, her own guardian angel. Good thing that he showed up, because evil beings had Maggie in their sights as the perfect instrument-- a woman who had Faith and waivered on Belief."}

Dresden kind of reminds me of Parker's Spenser- wise-cracking, always in trouble, a bit of a screw up, but with an undeniable charm.

{"text": "See full review for Legion at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n Now I kind of remember why I don't like reading books in a series until the whole series is out. I completely forgot what happened in Soldier, and believe it or not my review was of no help which kind of sucks. Thankfully, though, Kagawa does spend a few seconds rehashing what happened in the last book, so I wasn't completely lost. It also didn't help that this was another novel that I was reading during the busiest time of year at work and then right before I went on vacation. Whoops. \n Anyway, I keep forgetting how masterful of a storyteller Kagawa is. She takes something mythical and turns into, well, actually believable. There were a few times while reading Legion that I had to remind myself that, oh, yeah, this is a book about dragons and not human beings on the run from the CIA or something."}
{"text": "A Curse Dark as Gold is Bunce's debut novel, and a re-imagining of the folk tale Rumpelstiltskin. \n In Bunce's version, Charlotte and Rosie Miller are the last living descendants of the owners of Stirwaters mill. Stirwaters is the last industry holding their small town together, and Charlotte feels a burdened sense of over-responsibility to keep the mill running. Despite her best efforts, and the dubious assistance of her long-lost Uncle Wheeler, mishaps continue to happen which threaten the future of Stirwaters. Finally, Charlotte makes a deal with a strange man, a deal which may save Stirwaters but will cost Charlotte all that she holds most dear. \n A Curse Dark as Gold is well-researched. Bunce bases the story on the woolen industries of Britain and America in the late 1700s, in the early years of the Industrial Revolution. She's comfortable enough with her subject matter to introduce it effectively to her readers - we are neither overcome with information nor do we feel we're lacking. \n Unfortunately, the rest of the narrative is not so deftly handled. The pace of the book is slow, even plodding, at times. Bunce seems hesitant in places, and the result is that the reader seems to be watching a train wreck in slow motion - unable to help, unable to look away. The awkwardness is palpable. \n The reason I would not read this book again, however, is that the protagonist, Charlotte, thoroughly grates on my nerves. She is supposed to be the heroine, but her willful stubbornness sets poorly against the episodes of naivete, her business cunning belies her ignorance of the world beyond her village. I think the characterization is a reflection of Bunce's uncertainty with her own skills. \n I'm torn on whether to recommend this book to you. Indeed, it has some charming strengths, bits of gold among the straw, as it were. Mostly, however, you have to dig through too much straw to find too little gold to make it entirely worthwhile."}
{"text": "Another entertaining book in the series. I think I've enjoyed Zsadist's story the most so far. I think what bothers me most about this series is that Wrath is the \"Blind\" King, yet he sees everything. He's clearly not blind at all! Can't wait to read the next installment!"}
{"text": "After three weeks I have finally finished The Raven Boys, the first Maggie book I actually finished and I'm dancing with joy right now because this book is absolutely amazing. \n The Raven Boys is about Blue, daughter of a psychic though Blue doesn't have these psychic powers, and 4 boys who go to Aglionby who are branded as raven boys because that's the school's logo. Ever since she was little, Blue has been told that she will kill her true with with a kiss. And every April 24th, St. Mark's Eve, souls of people walk in the corpse road and these people will die within the year. Blue is shocked to actually see a soul of a person, and this person is Gansey, who is interested in the corpse road (or ley lines) and is searching for Glendower. \n I like the fact that there was only a pinch of romance, I also like the fact that there was brotherly love (kidding) and parent problems. I like the fact that I want more of the raven boys (all three four of them. They seem hot and perfect and rich but all of them have their flaws (even Ronan) \n Ladies and gentlemen, this book will totally impress you. It impress me. During the three weeks I have learned new vocabulary and how awesome magic is. I'm pretty sure there is a second book, right? This book also makes me wonder who Blue will end up with (despite her curse) and how the book will end. \n Also, this book has film rights so it's not surprising if this book is successful in the movie world. Ahhh, now excuse me, I'm going to dream about my dream cast."}
{"text": "I can't seem to escape tackling controversial topics, in this book the idea of family curses, although it's changed from a more tangible and realistic curse (such as alcoholism) into a fantastical idea. \n This book rather wrote itself. I knew the twist toward the end going in, and that it would tie in the Ripper murders, but the rest unfurled with each passing week. I intended to use Dr. Bell from the start. He's fascinating man, and was a fun character to write - a no-nonsense but very compassionate figure, devout in his faith and as remarkable for his observational skills as for his hidden talents. \n Alana was a throwaway character in \"The Secret in Belfast,\" important for only a few chapters, to establish the Conclave and Richard's role as their Influencer. But as I wrote those few pages about a remarkable woman with the incredible ability to \"punish\" those who use their gifts for evil, I knew she needed a novel and an entire back story of her own. Here, she has it, from the darkness in herself to her first meeting with Richard... although only observant readers will pick up on it. \n The decision to bring in Alistair and Henoria, from \"Thornewicke,\" was made for two reasons: I couldn't find a place for them in \"The Secret in Belfast,\" however much I wanted to, and my readers asked me to delve further into their marriage. Here, we have them a genuine couple for the first time, and find out a few more surprising secrets and nuances of the relationship between Guardians and Defenders. \n In my usual tongue in cheek way, I've slipped in literary nods to some of my favorite books and films, and made hints toward characters and places that will be important in future books... which may just be set in a time period much further back than 1888 England. But then, that's part of the fun of being a writer. Hopefully, it's fun for you, as my reader, too."}
{"text": "4.5 STARS Another gem from Jennifer L. Armentrout, full of visceral characters and an inventive world. At first I really wasn't sold on reading another YA paranormal book. The Wardens drew me in...Zayne drew me in. I love how he dotes on Layla and treats her like she is the most precious thing in his world. I also feel frustrated when he fights those feelings and seems oblivious to hers. When something in Layla changes, after she meets a demon prince, Roth. Zayne notices more and more changes in Layla and he finds it more and more difficult to keep her out of harms way. It will be too late to protect her heart, but maybe he can protect her soul from turning to the darkness that is always lurking."}

{"text": "Damn! That was a good book! (And I rarely ever start my reviews like this!) \n Kings or Pawns by JJ Sherwood is the first instalment in the Steps of Power series. And what a start! \n The novel deals with Hairem, who has ascended the throne after his father's passing, and who has to deal with a council of corrupt members, all working on their personal gains and away from the needs of their respective elven realms. \n There is also the army general Jikun, whom we see as a bit selfish but nonetheless skilled and who at least has an idea about the duties of his role as a general and the sacrifices he has to make. \n Moreover, there is the general's captain Navon, who dabbles in necromancy, despite his general's orders and despite there being a death penalty for such a practice. I particularly liked Navon's character: cynical, funny, wise and above all kind and loyal. \n I also loved and enjoyed Sherwood's ability in creating her settings, which is made clear from the beginning of the novel. \n There is character development - for good or worse - for various characters in the novel, including King Hairem, General Jikun and others. I also loved Alvena, a mute handmaid with a surprising role to play. She and Navon were my favourites in the novel. \n Basically every character in Kings or Pawns has a role to play. No characters are redundant; those who come and go like messengers are not given names as they are not important. The author is lauded for that. \n \"The temperature in Darival had fallen with the sun, who had also, it seemed, taken her blanket of clouds with her.\" \n Kings or Pawns had me thinking throughout and occasionally wondering if some characters were not as they appear. It also grabbed my interest towards the politics of running a country, albeit a fantastical ones, and had me wondering what happens when a good leader is surrounded by corrupt ones. \n It is going to take me sometime to shake off the brilliant political intrigue and storytelling. \n \"Unlike the palace treasury, [the personal finances] of the council members were filling up like a halfling's pockets in a treasure trove.\" \n I also liked the theme of entitlement throughout Kings or Pawns, which is seen in many characters but particularly the council members. \n There are also several songs and poems in the novel, highlighting Sherwood's ability in writing both prose and poetry equally well. \n The word flow throughout the whole book is exceptional. You don't want to miss a beat, even when things are calm and we're just given a description of place. \n Kings or Pawns is fast paced and will probably keep you reading up all day and night as it did me. There might be some nail biting especially towards the second half of the book. \n I would definitely love to pick up the second book in the Steps of Power series, but I need to get some sleep first! \n My review is part of the August-long Steps of Power blog tour. I wanted so badly to go through the posts but did not want to come up on any spoilers.

I can't wait to start the second volume, but at the same time, I'm a little leery of going into the lion's den again!"}
{"text": "I can't believe I made it all the way through to the end of this book. Maybe because I just kept waiting for something to happen and really it didn't. I have to give the author credit anyone that can literally write over 50 pages describing cupboards and one main setting of maybe a room. This book started out great but really I felt like I was in sand and going no where fast, and it just kept feeling to the end. \n I think it was the writing style, the style was more of telling the reader then actually bringing it to life and having it happen for me. There wasn't much dialogue so it was all told. Very time consuming. \n Great idea but not such great delievery of the story idea."}

Maybe I just hate superheroes (probably true) or felt burned out on the 'everyone has powers now!' storyline. There are amazing ass-kicking Asian-American women! There are evil cupcakes! But this story never felt like it went beyond that concept, and there was something too twee about this book for my tastes. If you don't care about social media or celebrities much, I have a feeling this story might not work for you, either. Strangely enough, I can relate to MCs that are vampires over an MC that's a personal media assistant. That probably says more about *me* than Kuhn's writing.

I loved all the relationships between each of the characters and the way that the friendships were weighted as equally important and even given more emphasis than the romances through the course of the story. The characters themselves were great too, and I was so invested in all of them. I thought it was interesting that they all had a point of view except for Wylan, which made me think he was hiding something. He kind of was, which we found out at the end, but it was still odd to me that he didn't have a perspective. Maybe six would have been too many, or maybe we'll just find out in the next one, which I am SO excited for. I think Inej was my favorite character, but I really loved all of them. They were all so well-written and fleshed out that I felt like I knew them all so well by the end.

{"text": "I am way beyond speechless right now. I cannot formulate words well enough to describe my love for this series and its author. \n I started reading this series when it first came out. I remember having to wait for all the books to be released; waiting patiently for cover pictures and the slightest bit of hope that maybe the release dates would be rushed so I could have them one after the other. The wait was worth it. So, so worth it. \n I was captivated by this story from the moment I saw a streak through a sentence in the first book book. One hardly sees that and they were all over Shatter Me; thoughts scratched off. Each of them forced me to feel more connected to Juliette. I love her. I love Adam. I love Warner. I love all of them. Tahereh Mafi wrote lines that made sure each was given their worth. \n Shatter Me was the introduction of it all and one that set expectations for the other books. I grew accustomed to Juliette here. Well, at least the Juliette she was then. I grew to love Adam and Kenji and the idea of defience against a government so harsh. Unravel Me, well, unraveled me. I grew to love Warner here. I finished the book it and immediately needed to know when the next book would be out. At last, it did. A masterpiece. A beauty of a conclusion that I had yet to experience in a series. To say that I was more content with this ending than Harry Potter's goes a long way. Suffice to say, I want more. I NEED MORE! \n The story was just so well created. She didn't just finish the story, no. She gave closure to every character and issue. Mafi took us through a lovely journey that I don't think I'll ever be able to forget and one that has been more satisfactory and REAL than most if not all the books in this genre. God knows how much I hated the ending of The Hunger Games and Delirium. This ending...Wow. \n This book deserved 95 stars. It deserves a movie and a TV show. Mafi deserves to be recognized for her sheer amazingness and incredible writing skills. I congratulate you, woman. You have, singlehandedly, toyed with my heart at no one's expense and all to make it radiate in unclouded love for you. Thank you."}
{"text": "This was loads better than the first. Seeing Alina come into her own as a leader, own her power and the command it gives her but still struggle with inexperience, never quite knowing who to trust, was very well written. She grew, still had her insecurities, but wasn't the mess that she was in book 1. Also, the fear of how her power would corrupt her was very intriguing. \n I understood why Mal felt the way he did but it was still hard not to resent him for holding Alina back. I felt sorry for him but he really impeded her progress. I really loved her taking charge, wanted the struggles of seizing and maintaining power explored but that was eclipsed by her troubled relationship with Mal. \n And, oh my God, what a treat Nickolai was! I loved every one of his dialogues and his presence definitely charms the reader. I wish there were stories centered around him and his adventures alone. I would read every single one. \n I really missed the Darkling though."}

When the likes of Tim O'Rourke and CJ Pinard come together you just know it was going to be good. \n Jax and Mia are your total opposites Jax works in a garage, has tatoos, a different girl every night. Mia a goody goody, ok she's kind of a stalker but she has her reasons, right? \n You'll just love this book it has a bit of everything and a little more, as I unexpectedly found out. Will Jax stick around when the truth comes out, it is alot to take in. \n Would love to read more about these two, so hopefully there will be book number 2."}
{"text": "This book was on a Flavorwire list of books you won't be assigned in high school, so I decided to check it out. \n And it's interesting. It's not quite what I expected, but I'm glad I read it. The story merges a post-apocalyptic future with a Caribbean voodoo context, and the characters are multi-generational and well written. The dialect wasn't fun to read, but I'm glad I listened to it rather than read it because the narrator, Peter Jay Fernandez, did a much better job than I ever could have done in my head. \n I plan to recommend it to my creative writing students, who love this genre but don't have much experience drawing characters and integrating conflict and the world they've created."}
{"text": "So I have to say Linger was a bit of disappointment to me, all the reviews said how great it is and how it was even better than Shiver. I kinda liked Shiver better, there wasn't too much going on between Sam and Grace in the romance department. Sam got caught in Grace's room by her parents and was banned from their home and Grace was forbidden to see Sam again. \n There was a new wolf in the group, Cole. He and Isabel were somewhat of an item, even though they were trying to deny it. They would get all hot and heavy and then just stop, didn't really understand that. They honestly were pretty cute together. \n The ending was a little unexpected and kinda left them in the same situation they were in before. I guess I will read the last book in the series, because I already read the other two. I sure hope that it is good."}

{"text": "The Gift by Lynsay Sands \n Kind of weak, and it felt even shorter than it was. Teddy (a character familiar to loyal readers) deserved better. IMHO, the relationship developed too quickly to be believable, there was no depth to story, and the age difference was slightly squiffy. \n Home for the Holidays by Jeaniene Frost \n Despite only being about 35 pages longer than the Sands tale, Home was nicely crafted and felt like a short novel, rather than a way to fill paper. The story introduced some family background for Bones and added even more appeal to bad boy Ian's character. This novella should serve as a highly satisfying way to tide fans over until the next full length Cat and Bones adventure."}
{"text": "I hate this book. I hate it hate it hate it hate it hate it. \n So now I must read the next one. \n Ok, so I don't actually hate it. But at one point, I wanted my review to simply be \"Spoiler Alert: EVERYONE DIES.\" \n But obviously since there is another book, and another, and another, and the fifth coming out this summer with seven projected in all, everyone does not actually die. But for all of the sentimental hearts out there, specifically me, I must warn you that if you want to read this book, be ready for an emotional roller coaster that will cause you to wake your husband at midnight more than once as you slam down the book to tell him you are refusing to read the book anymore. Generally speaking. \n But I have to admit it's a compelling read. The are in the process of making a television show about the books, and let's face it, we all love getting wrapped up into a series."}
{"text": "I think I liked the \"other\" couple who weren't the main characters. I enjoyed their story more."}
{"text": "I really liked the beginning of this book a lot. Two identical twins from the States move to London after inheriting all the possessions of their aunt, herself an identical twin of their mother. Her flat is right next to Highgate Cemetary, so there is much opportunity for musing upon death and encounters with ghosts. They also meet the other residents of the small apartment building where she lived and try to crack the mystery of how and why their aunt and mother cut off all communication with each other years before. \n It was about two-thirds of the way through the book that something really goofy happened, which caused something else even goofier to happen, and so on until the entire book collapsed under its own weight. Niffenegger has said in interviews that this book started as characters in search of a plot, and to be honest, I don't think she ever found one, at least not one that really works. However, the atmosphere and characters she's created are so strong and appealing that I recommend reading the book anyway, just with reservations."}
{"text": "3.5 stars"}
{"text": "I was first drawn to this book because it was compared to the writing of Alice Hoffman and Sarah Addison Allen, two authors of the Magical Realism genre whose books I have enjoyed over the years. Sadly, the comparison was unwarranted. The Wishing Thread lacks the expert storytelling of Hoffman, and characters did not have the warmth that Sarah Addison Allen is so adept at creating in her books. \n On the positive side, it did teach me that Tarrytown, NY is the home of the Sleepy Hollow/Headless Horseman story, a fact that came in handy the other night on Jeopardy."}

{"text": "This is the second book in a series, and should be read after TORTURED SOULS. \n 4.5 Stars \n Kacie, Logan and Daniel are back, this time dealing with a severe sorority house haunting. 40 years ago four members of a sorority were drugged by a psychology professor, and three of them were murdered. While time has passed these three souls have been maturing and getting stronger. Their sense of loss and fury has been harnessed into severe aggression. \n When two of the current residents decide to \"play\" with a Ouija board, they unleash a boat-load of malevolence. \n Logan's injured, and not just by the ghosts. Nope, he's pretty sensitive that Kacie (his girlfriend) and Daniel (his best friend) are starring in the school play that forces them to have a big 'ol kiss. This distraction leads Logan into unnecessary peril--and he's lucky to get help when he needs it. \n Kacie's channeling the spirits, but also dealing with the survivor's guilt. How would it feel to know that your mistake led to the torture and death of three of your good friends? Living with that burden is rough. \n I liked the teamwork displayed int he Orion Circle. They have excellent communication, and intriguing talents, from telekinesis to psychic powers, to spirit mediums, to persuasion, these kids (and their adult assistants) are a motley but interesting bunch. I sometime think there are TOO many characters, but the author does a good job of only focusing on 1-3 of them at a time. This story was less about Kacie (like TORTURED SOULS) than Logan, and I expect another book will focus more on Raven and Blake (vampire huntress and werewolf, respectively). \n The story rolls on, with excellent pacing and vivid descriptions. Expect to have the horror flick vibe, this reads like a movie in many ways. This is a YA paranormal adventure, with a DASH of romance, so it's clean of all but kisses, and filled with blood-thirsty villainy and dangerous ghosts."}

{"text": "There are a lot of aliens of various sorts in this story, including some really cool ones that I love! The characters are interesting, and the writing has great dialogue and lines I loved. There is some steamy sex, and sometimes it's practically non-stop. Hey, save some of that energy for fighting the baddies that are sneaking up on you. I started with #3 because the premise sounded like fun. Wedding and family problems and hostile aliens would make for a interesting mix, I thought, and it did. Another reviewer mentioned that everyone loved Kitty Katt too much. I saw what she meant, but it was well done, and I didn't find it irritating. (Sort of like fantasy now and then.) \n There are so many characters (good and bad) that sometimes it's hard keeping track; if I'd started with volumes 1 and 2, it would probably have been easier, but I knew I was taking that chance. I've bought them now because I enjoyed the characters and the writing--and further along in the series, that is pretty good. I'm looking forward to reading the first two. Highly recommended. Adults only."}

I started playing Witcher 1 a few years ago and was kind of intrigued by the world in which the events were set. Intended to start reading this book ages ago, but never quite managed to. Of late, I've been craving for a good fantasy fix and remembered about this book. Morally ambiguous scenarios, realistic characters, no shirking away from profanity in addition to presence of wit and sarcasm aplenty made the story pretty compelling. And I must mention the dark and twisted interpretation of popular fairy tales in some of these short stories. I felt they were brilliant! \n Although the collection of stories were related, a lot of questions do remain unanswered. I hope the mainline novels provide the answers! Also, I sincerely believe that this book deserves better visibility than what it currently has :)"}

Spesso durante la lettura dei primi capitoli, se non oltre, ho dovuto fermarmi per \"riordinare\" i fatti con l'intenzione di cogliere qualche dettaglio in piu. Affascinante ed enigmatico. \n Poetico e surreale. \n Magico e possibile. \n Inoltrarsi fra le pagine di questo libro e stata una sfida e quasi un privilegio, perche Erin Morgesteirn come un burattinaio con le sue marionette, tira le fila in modo tale da stregare, intrigante e affascinare i suoi lettori. Catapultati in un mondo onirico e meraviglioso, competitivo e crudele... reale eppur assolutamente impalpabile. \n Sei dentro un sogno o nelle sue vicinanze, perche ogni cosa che leggi e impossibile, ma l'autrice racconta tutto con estrema dovizia di particolari, tanto da ingabbiarti dentro questa realta fuori dalle leggi della fisica... una realta in cui, a volte, ognuno di noi vorrebbe smarrirsi! \n La chiave di lettura di questo libro e senza dubbio la suggestione. Lasciarsi suggestione da ogni storia e non cercarne subito il perche, permettere alle parole di cullarci in questo oblio di magia e vita! \n L'autrice crea una gabbia di parole che diventano poesia, e le trasforma in luoghi incantati e fuori dal tempo. \n Sono volutamente criptica e leggendo \"Il circo della notte\" ne capirete il perche, c'e poco da dire che non risulti spoiler. \n Lo stile della Morgenstern e profondamente enigmatico, misterioso, onirico e poetico. \n Visivamente potente e d'effetto. \n Concludo dicendo che questo libro e uno di quelli che \"deve\" essere riletto, forse per comprenderne meglio le sfumature, e di certo per avere una visione completa della storia. \n Molte sono le frasi che ho letto e riletto, ma questa rimane la mia preferita in assoluto: \n \"Quasi che amore e perdita vivessero nello stesso istante, insieme, in una specie di stupendo dolore. \n Inscindibili e inseparabili. \n Uno stupendo dolore! \n Un libro imperdibile [?]"}

{"text": "A brilliant and heart-wrenching end to The Infernal Devices series. I feel so much right now after just finishing this. I will put a proper review up shortly. \n My offical review: \n Mortmain, The Magister, has been quiet and most Shadowhunters believe he has run to lick his wounds. Jem, Tessa, and Will know that this is just the calm before the storm, because he did not get what he wanted--Tessa and revenge on the Shadowhunters. \n Life continues on. Jem and Tessa prepare to marry as Will silently loves Tessa from afar. Their love for each other isn't a choice--they are all a part of a whole. The choices, and timing of those choices, seem to be the crux of the story for me. \n While this love triangle is almost unbearble, the Councul is trying to have others rally around removing Charlotte from running the London Institute, but he is doing such descretely. We find out what kind of men the Lightwoods are when they are tested in this situation. \n Again, we have a novel filled with good and evil, love, betrayal, family, loyalty, action, an a story of finding where you belong."}
{"text": "Insanity has got to be the quickest-paced novel I've ever read! Full of short chapters and never-ending madness... I absolutely loved this book. \n I don't know if there is a particular character I liked over the others, but I most certainly liked them all for various reasons: the imagery, characters, the background, the different settings, the sarcasm and the humour. Even the Cheshire. \n The first instalment in the Mad in Wonderland series by Cameron Jace, Insanity revolves around Lewis Carroll's famous Alice in Wonderland books. Jace uses the original novels and twists them brilliantly into black comedy and humourous but serious fiction. \n I'm pretty sure this novel falls under the 'absurd' genre but it will the novel of the absurd (not the theatre of the absurd). \n While I haven't read the original books, I have definitely added them to my endless to-read list after this and will be seeing the old literary characters in a brand new light after this read. \n It seems Wonderland was full of monsters that Lewis Carroll had to lock up with magic; however, several of these monsters escaped and shape-shifted into humans. While some live peacefully, others are wreaking havoc, particularly the Cheshire Cat, who is on a killing spree. \n \"If you've survived parasites and bacteria until the age of nineteen, you can survive sane people\" - one of the many cool-but-insane things the Pillar tells Alice in the story. \n Insanity is mostly narrated in the first person from Alice's perspective, with a few exceptions narrated in the third person. Alice, the protagonist of the novel, is young girl in an asylum. She regularly endures shock therapy at the hands of her wardens, who seem to enjoy it A LOT. She has no idea who she is or what the outside world is like. Soon, she is introduced to a serial killer living in the asylum known as Pillar the Killer. \n The two inhabitants of the Radcliffe Asylum embark on morning-only journeys to find the Cheshire and begin to meet several people/characters from Lewis Carroll's book. \n Everything in Insanity and the mystery behind the killings is related to Lewis Carroll, his life and writing. It's brilliantly entertaining and mind-boggling to both Alice and the reader. \n For a book named Insanity, there is a very fine line between what is considered rational and what is seen as 'crazy' and Alice finds it very difficult to differentiate and to be sane in the modern world. \n Moreover, she cannot remember her past and finds it easier to be crazy. Even the asylum becomes 'home' after she goes out to the real world. \n I particularly like how comic relief and sarcasm are interwoven in the fabric of the novel; they are ever-present, so that the reader's brain is never fried but is constantly relieved even in the most serious of situations. \n When we first meet Alice, she narrates how she keeps her sanity, saying \"My orange flower is also my personal rain check for my sanity. If I talk to her and she doesn't reply, I know I am not hallucinating. If she talks to me, all kinds of nonsense starts to happen. Insanity prevails.\" \n Throughout the novel, there is wisdom in insanity; I must admit I found it way better than Shakespeare's Hamlet - both book and character. While the play which is at the top of my never-likely-to-read-again list, Insanity is deeper and better played. I'm not sure how to say, I just loved how the absurdity made a lot of sense. \n Alice landed in the asylum after a tragedy; it was said that had killed all her friends on a school bus after claiming they were Wonderland Monsters, including her boyfriend, whom she cannot remember. When she tries to remember him, she says: \"Whatever we shared is buried somewhere in the abyss of my mind. I just don't know how to swim deep enough and return to the surface with it.\" \n Cameron Jace cleverly critises modern governments in his novel Insanity. Several things the Pillar says ring true. The encounter with Maragret Kent is interesting and leaves much food for thought. I must say, there are things I never understood about governments, no I - believe it or not - actually look at them in a new light and have a better understanding. (I can't believe it either). \n I also particularly liked Jace's use of modern-day governments, the comparisons and the examples \n With a lot of action, running around, getting a Certificate of Insanity, going to the British Parliament and chasing a serial killer - with the help of another serial killer - Insanity is by all means a highly enjoyable and insane must-read. \n Note: I received a free copy of Insanity via Xpresso Book Tours in exchange for an honest review."}

{"text": "This is not a good book. While I was not a huge fan of the first two - I gave both of them three stars despite glaring flaws - I was looking forward to this book. I was hoping we would finally get a grand epic with huge battles, political alliances and intrigue, and magic and prophesy. \n Instead, I got this frigging book. If you really need to find out what happens, I suggest to start around page 400 because nothing happens before except for possibly one of the dumbest and most out of character arguments. I'm not kidding. Rafe and Lia, who had previously been shown to be capable of thinking logically, suddenly become irrational and stubborn and have the same argument for 200 pages because...DRAMA!!!!! I wish I were exaggerating. \n Honestly, I read the last 50 pages or so, but had skimmed the previous 100-150 pages because I just wanted to be done. \n We don't even get and epic last battle. They fight for a little bit and then Lia gives a little speech (some how magically amplified by magic? From somewhere? Because prophesy?) and the Vendans lay down their weapons. I thought that Lia was supposed to sacrifice herself not just give a little speech. Why wouldn't you just ignore previous major plot points? \n So why two and not one star? There were some good moments, like Lia confronting the council, and I usually reserve one stars for books that offend me in some way or do something completely unforgivable. It's super hard to write a book and so, unless a book manages to do one of the two things previously mentioned, a book that I didn't like will get two stars."}

{"text": "Shadows by Christi J. Whitney \n Shadows picks up at graduation, about 1-2 months after Grey ended. Sebastian graduated, he's still estranged from his friends and still a gargoyle. I thought we might get a moment where he reveals his secret to Katie early on, but it doesn't happen. Instead, Sebastian agrees to go back to the Romaney clan. This is clearly trouble. \n Do I ever love the brotherly relationship between Hugo and Sebastian. Grey surprised me when it focused on it towards the end without ever letting up on also focusing on the romance with Josephine. It's nice to see characters who love their family, friends, and have romantic interests. We learn a lot more about the Romaney family in this novel, including their particular family dynamic. The Romaney's (with Nicholas as bandoleer) are more authoritarian than the Corsi clan, which made me miss the relationships between the Gypsy Ink Corsi's even more as the novel progressed. \n There's a lot of talk about how Sebastian should accept himself and his gargoyle nature. There's a lot I don't know about this. That's partly because the nature of the Shadowen is kept secret. It seems like a not-so-good idea to me. This plot thread remains unresolved by the end of the story. There's a narrative split between the acceptance camp and the repression camp, and it's ultimately not clear which way will solve Sebastian's problems controlling himself. \n Sebastian's life with the Romaney's is rough. There are new levels of terrible explored, and when you think it's not going to get worse, it does. No one likes him, and a big mystery about the nature of the Shadowen develops. One of the gargoyles from Grey returns, but he's a true, mindless monster now. The fear that Sebastian is going to turn is real. THE FEAR IS REAL. Like in Grey, Shadows pays off the emotional stakes at the end of the story. I suspected Shadows was going to have a downer ending, but that still didn't prepare me for how angry it made me. I need book 3 right now I'm not okay with my feelings at the end this book. \n Josephine got a personality! She's still a quiet, sometimes 'too pure' character, but the rigid family structure of the Romaney clan shaped who she is. She doesn't have real friends; she's being groomed for an important role in gypsy society, so she's carried that responsibility from a young age. She's a girl who never got to be a child, and she's clearly repressed a lot of feelings. It's difficult to empathize with a guarded character because, well, they don't emote much, but Josephine comes into herself in Shadows. It's official: I believe in her as a love interest. \n The new Romaney clan characters are strong. Zara, Phoebe, and twin Francis, who got some but not a lot of time last book, stand out. There are a lot of effortlessly likable characters in this story. There are also a lot of detestable characters in this story. Quentin wins the most hated character, hands down. I typically don't like when 'the other woman/the other man' is the default bad character, but the twist at the end of the story sold me on Quentin as a villain with his own, particular motives beyond 'easy love triangle antagonist.' Augustine makes an appearance again, and while he appeared more of a nuisance in Grey, he's advanced to the stage of The Chessmaster in Shadows. Augustine has a plan, and while some of it's clear, most of his secrets remain mysteries. Shadows ends on the biggest of cliff hangers, so don't expect resolution, even the bitter sweet kind, like in Grey."}

{"text": "Oh! Well! That was incredibly exciting! After becoming a big fan of the Dresden Files, I had high hopes for Jim Butcher's foray into steampunk fantasy and he certainly did not disappoint. \n The world Butcher has built is fascinating - giving you just enough information about how he's imagined it to understand the events taking place but left me very curious about the other Spires, the history of the Spires and their Builders. Butcher does push you into the deep end, so to speak, of his world from the first page so for me there was a bit of mental fumbling in the beginning trying to understand various contexts, but it wasn't really an issue. I'd rather be shoved head first into a fantasy, almost so I can explore it myself, rather than have it laid out for me like a history lesson or tour. \n The action though! It doesn't stop, one battle after another and the action scenes are written skillfully enough that I have no problem seeing them play out in my imagination, which is something I struggle with sometime as I really don't have much of a frame of reference for combat maneuvers in real life. The airship conflicts in the opening and climax of the story are particular highlights and they were like a roller coaster in intensity for me. I almost wish I was actually on board Predator during those scenes. Almost. \n I thought the cast was great too - a really strong, and diverse ensemble. With a few minor exceptions, I was generally impressed by the level of equality of the sexes Butcher portrayed. I think Butcher does very well here in writing his female characters - the characters recognize their own limitations, but perform to the very height of them and allow their skills to complement those of their male companions. Very few characters weren't memorable and those that weren't, were minor supports anyway. The primary characters have depth and enough teased history that no one really comes off as flat or a caricature of the traditional archetypes. Gwen seemed a bit cardboard occasionally, but I can put some of that down to her youthful optimism, naivete, and aristocratic upbringing clashing with the conflicts she's experiencing for the first time in the world beyond the upper echelons of society and her initial training for the guards. \n All in all, Butcher knows how to write a series and keep his readers coming back for more. Without doubt, I'll be reading the next installment when it come out."}

{"text": "This first book in the sci fi/dystopian series was not all that I was expecting, and I left it feeling a little disappointed. \n Also, although I wasn't \"spoiled\" for anything in the book, it is a well known fact that the fandom hates Adam and loves Warner. So, this book was difficult to get through with Adam being such a main character and knowing that something is going to happen to ruin the image we get of him in this book. (Not that I liked him anyway...) \n WHAT I LIKED: \n -The writing is beautiful and didn't feel like I was reading a YA novel based on the writing. \n -Juliette. I see a lot of potential in her character and I am very interested to see where she takes us. \n -Warner. What a wonderful villain. His way of speaking and demeanor, although we saw little of it, was still such a treat. \n WHAT I DISLIKED: \n -Adam. As I said before, I already know something is going to go down with him, even though I don't know what it is, and as such, I cannot trust him. \n -The INSTALOVE. Really?! I understand the poor girl has had no one touch her, but her obsession with him was part of the story I hated the most. She was such a more complex character when her thoughts weren't revolving around him. \n -The lack of world building. It felt like a very basic dystopian premise without much explanation. \n -Lack of characters. We really only got to see Adam and Juliette, with a few other characters mixed in that weren't really developed. Even Adam and Juliette were mostly wrapped up in each other, as I said before. This lack of character development seems common in the first book in a series and may just be something I should get used to... (nope.) \n Overall, I didn't enjoy this book like I thought I would. I was more slogging through it in order to get to the rest of the books in the series, because I know so many fans of this series cannot be crazy."}
{"text": "I liked the world building and some of the more unusual elements of this story, but the bad language and sensuality threw me off a bit. It also had a tough time holding my interest, which means sometimes I started reading and had forgotten what I'd read the night before. Just not my piece of cake, I suppose."}

Orion North has finally found his mate. When Artemis' friend is taken, she is forced to turn to Orion. But once her friend is saved she has no intentions of sticking around. Although, Artemis soon learns that resisting her mate only makes it harder. \n Unlike other serials I have read, I found the transition between serials to be smooth flowing.

{"text": "There was so much hype around this book and I'm always hesitant to read books that get so much hype. Red Queen was definitely worthy of all the attention, in my opinion. It had a Selection feel to it (which I loved) with some fantasy too. \n I found myself flipping back and forth liking Cal and Maven. It was really hard to like them both at the same time. You can kind of guess what will happen, but I found myself surprised when it did. I had a really hard time putting this book down, I just wanted to keep reading. The end of the book really gets intense and made me want to read more, so I'm really hoping this is the first book in series!"}

{"text": "Actual rating: 4.5. \n Review originally posted on journeyintotheshelves.tumblr.com \n **I received an ARC of this book courtesy of HarperCollins at New York Comic Con. This has had no bearing on this review. \n One of my most anticipated releases of 2016, Glass Sword is the sequel to the bestselling Red Queen. The story centers around Mare Barrow, a girl born with red blood, but has the powers of those with silver. She thinks she's the only one of her kind, but when she discovers that there are others out there like her, Mare is determined to find them. But Maven, the sinister and vindictive king, is not quite ready to let go of her just yet. Action packed and emotionally charged, Glass Sword does not disappoint and is definitely one not to be missed. \n It may not seem like it at first, but Glass Sword is full of nonstop action, emotion, and turmoil. There was a lot more of internal conflict and dialogue in this novel than in Red Queen, but it didn't slow the momentum of the plot in the slightest. The Mare Barrow of Glass Sword is very different from the Mare Barrow that we meet at the beginning of Red Queen, so watching her development and struggles within herself were engaging and entertaining to read. It's really the second half of the book where the action picks up and the pages seem to fly by. \n My favorite aspect of this novel is Aveyard's world building. The world that started to reveal itself in Red Queen expands massively in this novel. Aveyard does a great job at describing the atmosphere and all of the different cities and places that Mare and her team visit. Capturing the essence of a place is crucial to developing and writing a fantastic fantasy novel, and Aveyard truly nails this skill. I just really hope that there's a map in the final bind up because it would help visualizing where places are in relation to each other (plus, I just love maps). \n The characters that Aveyard introduces and continues to develop are vastly interesting and complex. From Farley to Maven, each one of the characters grows in depth and really adds dimension to the story; most particularly is the development of Mare. Mare Barrow is not a main character that everyone will like. I don't like her, and if I had the chance to meet her I'm not sure that I would want to. But, that does not hinder the fact that she is deeply complex. She's not a likable character, but she goes through so much conflict and does things that no one else would in order to survive that you cannot help but feel for her. \n I really enjoyed Cal and Mare's relationship in Red Queen, however it seems a bit forced in this one. The chemistry between them isn't as strings it was and I'm curious to see where she takes them in the next book. Especially, after the events that unfolded at the end of the novel. \n You thought the ending of Red Queen was a cliffhanger? Wait until the end of Glass Sword. Let's just say I'm \"patiently\" waiting for Book 3. \n Overall, I deeply enjoyed Glass Sword. With a dash of romance, one psychotic ruler, and a brewing civil war, it's a great action packed novel that explores the emotional and psychological ramifications of wartime actions."}
{"text": "Beautiful writing, but so slow I couldn't get into it. Interesting, because this book came out around the same time as Twilight and its very similar. But its about a girl and a werefolf. And I consider Twilight to have horrible writing, but a interesting story. And which sold better? Twilight. I'm not saying I agree with that, because I value beautiful writing - but it does say some interesting things about our society."}

{"text": "3.5 stars, 5th&up \n I found this to be a very fast-paced and entertaining addition to the superhero fiction genre, told from the perspective of a super villain in training who- thanks to a new friend- begin to wonder if using his powers for the dark side is the right way to go."}
{"text": "I picked this paperback up at a conference and WOW! Here's a twist for you on a strong protagonist - an unrepentant female assassin! For the antagonist, why not introduce the only ethical detective left on a morally corrupt police force - and suggest that he might be a truly conflicted love interest, and the assassin killed his partner. Enough tension for you yet? It sure was for me. Throw in the gritty dystopian setting, compelling secondary characters, and intriguing plot and I couldn't turn the pages fast enough. Then, I got to the end of this first book in the Elemental Assassin series. While satisfied with the story conclusion, I'm hooked. I immediately jumped back online looking for Book 2. If you love dystopian paranormal suspense with romantic elements, that are likely to build in the upcoming books, this series is for you."}
{"text": "Book four of the series. I'm looking forward to reading the last! \n I really enjoyed the addition of Rachel Elizabeth Dare--and the fact that she has three names. The idea of mortals being able to see through Mist and that Percy's mom can is neat. \n My new hypothesis about why these are so popular with kids while Harry Potter has gone to the side is that they don't become more complex as the series goes on. They are (fairly) predictable, and there is no \"death of Hedwig\" event. Now, we haven't gotten to the last one, so maybe I'm in for a super Tyson death, but my guess is no. \n These books are fun and I am really enjoying reading them, but they're not challenging on any level."}
{"text": "Gini Koch is good at bringing us up to speed--not an easy task with all the accumulating characters, and it slows it down a bit at the beginning. 'Course we've lost characters too; I miss the Uncles! And I've lost track of all the Operations (previous books)... She did a good job of filling Cabinet posts, etc. and then moving on. But then, as usual, the story kicks into high gear and we're off. I love the characters, although I'd like to see more of the Poofs, but I'm happy to see more of Algar. There's fun and excitement and real danger and suspense and repartee. And frankly, I'm impressed by the songs and bands she inserts along the way, even though I'm pretty ignorant in that field. And I was angry along with Kitty Katt later... (No spoilers or I'd mention more of all the characters and scenes I loved.) \n Note: I was happy to see Over and Out used correctly. Begging the question--not so much. (I'm even losing track of what it really means!) And I think it's about time there was a companion--with a glossary--for the books. Not happy with foxcats and pigdogs for names."}

{"text": "See full review for Twilight at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n Susannah Simon's junior year has had one interesting start. She has gone from being completely excited about starting school to completely dreading it when Paul Slater - her worst enemy and guy who seems to be crushing on her - shows up to make her life a living hell. Then there is the whole issue with Jesse who moved out of her bedroom not because he didn't like Suze the same way she liked him, but because he had feelings for her too and didn't find it proper to be living with her. Now, she has a twisted deal with Paul - she'll attend his mediator/shifter lessons just as long as he doesn't try to get rid of Jesse. And the deal, despite Suze's misgivings seems to be working. \n That is until one night when she runs into Paul and he cryptically suggests that he might not send Jesse's soul to the shadowland, but instead make it so that way he lives a full life. She's confused and doesn't understand until she has a talk with Paul's grandfather. As a shifter they have the ability to go back in time to help a ghost and make it so that they don't die. But it's tricky and takes away brain cells, and Suze knows that Paul is willing to do it if it means he gets what he wants. Her. \n Anyway, for a series that I liked I wasn't all that thrilled with this book. At the time it was the final book in the series and I have to say that I didn't like it at all. The plot lines were tied up to neatly. Not to mention, it's another book that has to deal with time travel and the thought of different timelines makes my head hurt."}

{"text": ".. .:*deg.. .:*deg.. .:*deg.. .:*deg Crosspost: mytokyoblues.wordpress.com \n I really enjoyed the first book so much, but I found the second book in this series to be a bit more frustrating than the first one because of all of the miscommunication!! Don't get me wrong, I don't hate the book, but it was an emotional roller coaster ride for me when I was reading. I found it stressful because so many things were happening! The Winner's Crime focuses more on politics rather than romance. ([?]<[?]) \n What I really enjoyed about this book was how the drama was built up. I didn't know what to expect from this book! Kestrel was so out of her element. She was still the intelligent, cunning strategist from the first book, but she did not have the upper hand. No matter what she was doing, it felt that the Emperor was always ahead of her. Kestrel tried to do what was best for her and Arin by distancing herself. She tried to be indifferent even though she still loved him. She believed it was best for Arin not to know that she was helping him. She didn't have allies with her, not even Verex. Kestrel suffered a lot more in this book than the first one. Jess, her best friend, did not want to associate herself with Kestrel. Jess was resentful and hateful towards Kestrel even though Kestrel saved her in the first book. Then there's the constant abuse she endures because of the Emperor. Lastly, her father turning her in to the Emperor. That part crushed me the most. Kestrel adores and loves her father, but I just knew he would pick Valoria over Kestrel even if she is his only family. Right in the feels. 0*deg(/16></16)deg*0 \n I wanted to slap Arin. I was so frustrated with him. He always kept coming at the wrong time! Why couldn't he try to meet Kestrel in secret? Why did he always have to show up in the worst place possible? So many problems could have been avoided if Kestrel and Arin communicated with each other and teamed up. Arin was focused on building alliances with the Eastern people in order to stop the tyranny of the emperor. Then that kiss scene with the queen! Nope, nope nope. I do not like that pairing at all! (+*D*) + Shan +-+ \n I thought that Prince Verex was going to become Arin's rival. I assumed a love triangle was going to be formed. That did not happened, instead Verex was more of a friend to Kestrel than anything else. Even though his role was small, I really liked Verex. He was in the same position as Kestrel was. He was forced into a marriage like Kestrel, and loves another. He is far more compassionate and kind than his father. I really hopes he inherits the kingdom and marries Risha. Hoping Princess Risha is the one to get rid of the emperor. (((7jjop *D* )7*)) ty s \n The ending broke my heart! The cliffhanger. I wasn't ready for it. It was good and I just can't believe that happened. Why didn't Tensen give Arin the letter?! ltthYi tth)l That would have cleared so many things! He would have known the truth! It just upsets me that Arin doesn't know that Kestrel is going to a labor camp. I don't think it's possible that this series will end on a happy note. Praying it's not a tragedy. I hate the emperor. I really hope he gets what he deserves in the end. I am excited to see how the upcoming war will unfold. I just want the book now! [?](-{-[?]) .. .:*deg.. .:*deg.. .:*deg.. .:*deg"}
{"text": "** copy received by Gallery books in exchange for honest review - XOXperts ** \n \"Vampire please,\" she murmured, \"make it worth it. Make it . . .\" \n When their lips touched, he groaned; electricity seemed to prick at his skin. He pulled back from her. \"My God.\" Nothing had ever felt so powerful, so right, as this kiss. Her hungry expression deepened. \n This book was everything I hoped it'd be and wished for - seriously, I inhaled it and hands down, it blew my mind. I can honestly say Sebastian is one of my favorite vampires ever. He's a gentlemen, caring, and yet very dominating and naughty. He's the whole package. \n No Rest For The Wicked was a thrilling read, packed with lots of twists and turns and a whole lot of action - perfect mixture to make me a happy reader. \n Sebastian got turned into a vampire 300+ years ago by his brother Nikolai and ever since then he hated what he became. So he hid in his home letting his meaningless life pass by; for years, decades even, he stood in the shadows pitying his existence until she came to him. Kaderin, the Valkyrie's top assassin, to kill him. \n She hates vampire. Vampires are the reason why she lost her sisters. Vampires are the reason why the gods fulfilled her wish to never feel again - she couldn't handle her pain and wanted to be numb. Numb to slay more vampires, her favorite sport, until she meets Sebastian, her next victim. The first vampire who doesn't care if she kills him, the first vampire she can't seem to kill. The first vampire who evokes something within her - a hunger and desire like no other. \n She wants the forbidden but knows it can't be. She can't fall for the enemy and is confused by her action, thoughts and overall feelings - who seem to drown her - when looking at this handsome vampire. \n \"Had any male tasted so good?His taste made her body react with animal needs so strong, she twitched as she resisted them. She wanted to rip his jeans from him, take that thick shaft in both hands, and lick its length in a frenzy.\" \n Ladies, their encounters were smoking hot and I lost count how many times I fanned myself to calm down -whoa. I can't say she made it easy for him and he, too, stood his ground, showing her his limits. But you can only pretend and deny for so long until your deepest desires overpower you because the person (or creature) in front of you is your soulmate, your mate/bride, your fate, and your lifeline. \n What I loved about the second book in the Immortal After Dark series is that it's full with action. Kaderin competes in the Hei, a contest that occurs every 250 yrs where all Lore creatures have to gather treasures from around the world. The fastest and strongest wins and the prize is always worth the risk, as it was this year. I loved reading how Kaderin is such a strong female fighter, she's a born assassin, and Sebastian was just as impressed - he the warlord from Estonia. He battled by her side and what they went through was brutal but it strengthened their bond. \n This book was brilliant and the happy ending was well deserved - prepare your heart for some surprises! Mrs Cole is one heck of an author and I can't seem to get enough of her characters and stories. #TopFavorite so far! \n ___________________________________ \n Read all my review (A-Z) on the blog \n Like the blog on Facebook \n Email subscription to my blog"}

Not alot. :) \n Hugh is the Premier of the pack. His power is so powerful that he needs a Siphon to help carry his reserve so he doesn't overload and die. Unfortunately he has taken his Siphon for granted. \n The Siphon is tired of being invisible so tries to take care of his own choices for once with near devastating results. When Hugh realizes that he has neglected his Siphon he vows to make a change. First the Siphon gets a name ...Johnnie. Second he gets to know Johnnie. And the more he gets to know him the more he likes what he sees. \n For Hugh sex is just about the release of hormones and semen. For the first time in a decade he experiences something so much more with Johnnie. For Hugh and his pack they are animals first humans second, but they have a thing or two to learn from the humans. Like the notion of the emotion love. Hugh's first priority has always been his pack but once he falls for Johnnie he starts to realize that with this connection he gets so much more. \n \"They need their Premier. I need my Siphon.\" \n I loved Hugh and Johnnie together. They were made for each other and were each others ying to their yang. I loved how Cardeno C's mind works and we get introduced to another world where love is love no matter what. \n Adored it! Adored Hugh and Siphon.

{"text": "Whew what to say?....Damn that was a long book. lol This is far from my regular reading so it took a lot of reading and putting it down before I was intrigued to continue reading. I have to say it is very beautifully written. Carey's imagery and storytelling is truly spell bounding. I hadn't realized how invested I was until some 700 pages in when I found myself sobbing while still turning the pages. I am getting the next one because I now have to find out what happens next. \n Why it didn't get rated higher. \n 1.) It takes a lot before anything happens. Lots of back story and building I had to force myself the first hundred something pages. \n 2.) Not enough sex. There I said it. I could have done with more sex, more s&m whatever just more. Every time my interests piqued it was over and done with. \n Otherwise I would say this isn't a book for everyone but those who value good writing, lot's of detail,and a good heroin who is realistic and flawed should like this."}

{"text": "What could have been a sweet, innocent story turned into a rather long drawn out novel. It seemed as if a vast majority of the book spent developing characters and not plot. The writing while almost interesting came off as if it was someone trying to be cool with a younger crowd but not quite achieving it. \n Also as far as mystery and fantasy goes. The first 100 pages only briefly mention it. Which would lose about any child's interest. It certainly lost mine and I've read some of the worst books. \n I had such high expectations for this novel and it didn't live up to it. It's a shame."}
{"text": "This is the first book in a series, and features an accessory character from the Finishing School series who is all grown up now. It's an adult romance, set in a 1870s England Steampunk world, rife with political intrigue, assassins, vampires, werewolves, and mechanicals. \n Preshea Buss is a four-time widow, mostly by choice. Trained as an assassin in her Finishing School she accepted the favor of a known vampire, Lord Akeldama, who proceeded to get her ingratiated to men who needed dispatch. Well, not the last one. He was just old, and not very troublesome. Dubbed the \"Mourning Star\" by the tabloids, she's never met a man who'd claim her heart. She's been contracted to destroy the budding romance of a plain, but well-fortuned woman, Lady Violet, and her erstwhile, penniless suitor, Mr. Jackson, by Lady Violet's father, the Duke of Snodgrove. It's not really Preshea's cup of Darjeeling, but the reward will enable her to ruin the one man who decimated her heart: her dastardly father. Plus, there are concerns the Duke is in grave danger of assassination. Preshea can protect the Duke while she manages Mr. Jackson... \n Captain Gavin Ruthven is a recent retiree from Her Majesty's service. The tall, broad Scotsman would normally never be interested in a wee lass like the Mourning Star, but they are thrown together for three weeks while he attends his longtime friend, Jack (Mr. Jackson) on his quest for Lady Violet's hand. It's a good cover for the captain's other mission: ensure the Duke isn't killed. Is the noted widow there for pleasure, or will she seal the duke's death? \n I was drawn to this author because of her quirky and fun YA steampunk books. While we are still in that world per se, this novella is fully adult, with zinging banter, scandalous repartee, and steamy interludes. It's not a kids book, by any means, and I really enjoyed this slow-burning romance. Preshea has never been touched with love. Abused as a child, and a married woman, she has no need for another man in her life. She's well-settled due to her many inheritances, and Captain Ruthven--while attractive--initially appears the epitome of a lumbering brute. Yet, the more time they spend the more she is captivated and intrigued by his quiet nature and compassionate conversation. Gavin has little interest in the staid ladies of the ton, even if he were a catch. He's done well financially, making a decent fortune in investments, but he needs a woman who would take him well-in-hand. In short, he's a submissive, and he lives to pleasure women with his compliance, as well as his body. \n Expect mischief and mayhem, and the employment of dirigibles to both assassination and seduction. As with previous books, the story is rollicking with a pace that sweeps the reader into falling for unlikely heroes. Gavin is perfectly edible, and Preshea is a lonely woman who never understood all that she'd missed growing up so isolated. Not only does she gain a lover, she makes dear friends. Poor Mr. Jackson, is, however, broken-hearted....for a time."}
{"text": "This still felt like a Falling Kingdoms book so fans may not be as let down as I was. But this book felt very rushed and off balance. With the amount of characters, we didn't have enough time even with the core 4 to really see development from them. We had some character back tracking that felt unnecessary. Twists had no foreshadowing so they felt misplaced. And there were some tropes pulled out that I felt were ridiculous. It doesn't feel as consistent as the previous installments, which have consistently gotten better and built upon one another. This feels separate in some way. \n I still enjoyed it! I love this world and these characters, and I'm always happy to see them. There were some developments and back stories that I loved seeing more of. But with how rushed this felt, it does make me nervous for the last book. \n Video review/discussion to come!"}
{"text": "Labyrinth Lost by Zoraida Cordova \n You want some diverse fantasy? Amazing characters? New and interesting worlds? Exciting and fresh mythos? Then this book is for you. \n In many ways, I kind of wish The Bone Witch had been this brilliant. Labyrinth Lost opens in Brooklyn with young bruja, Alejandra (aka Alex), dreading her powers. She witnessed her father's disappearance--or maybe death--when he goes to take care of her dead and possessed cat, Miluna. After that, Alex's father disappears, and she can't let go of the guilt that his demise was all her fault. Alex can feel her power, and she tries desperately to suppress it even though her mother and sisters (Lula and Rose) have their own powers and push Alex to come into her own. \n And that's just the set-up. Things go to hell (literally) when Alex attempts a spell on her Deathday to remove her powers and her connection from her ancestors. Instead, she opens a portal to Las Lagos and traps her family their--and they're at the mercy of an evil, corrupt bruja. \n The Las Lagos world is stunning. The book was good when Alex dealt with her family and her powers in Brooklyn, but when she and Nova cross into Las Lagos, things go batshit--and it's wonderful. A mysterious brjuo, Nova, helps Alex travel to Las Lagos, and his tragic yet interesting past becomes central to the plot. Nova couldn't complete his Deathday ceremony, so he lost control of his powers, and that's gradually killing him. Fortunately, Alex finds other allies in Las Lagos. The native avians and fauns are amazing characters even though they don't play major roles. Each character feels distinct, and I also liked Alex's friend--and definitely more than a friend later--Rishi. In a world of magic, Rishi is purely human, but she follows Alex into the portal to Las Lagos anyway. Rishi has no powers, no defense against the horrors of Las Lagos, and Alex sacrifices herself to keep Rishi alive. The story is incredibly powerful up to this point. \n Unfortunately, the ending wimped out a little bit. The story never revolves Nova's moral quandary. It tries, but it leaves his feelings for Alex and his motivations a little loose for the sequel. And yes, there's obviously going to be a sequel. Alex's missing father is dangled as an unsolved mystery throughout the novel. At the end (not a huge spoiler now), it's still unresolved and used as a teasing cliffhanger. If Alex's missing dad could've been worked into the final battle, it could've provided some twist or surprise to the ending. The battle with the evil brjua is straight forward and has zero surprises, which was the most shocking thing about a story that kept adding layers to it every chance it got. Maybe I'm also a cliff hanger hater, but this one worked, even if I thought it was a bit unnecessary. \n Still, I loved so much about this story. Alex is such a well-fleshed out character, and her emotional struggle with her family and her history drives the plot the entire time. The side characters (except maybe the evil bruja sorceress) were well-written and felt organic and real throughout the story. This made some of the weaker moments fly by, and the alternative universe of Las Lagos is unique and where the real story takes place. \n Rating: 5 stars for most of it, but it lost momentum at the end. The unresolved plot threads were VERY unresolved, but I loved the characters and their worlds enough to enjoy this story thoroughly."}

{"text": "This is a hard book to read in more ways than one. For one thing, it is extremely disjointed, switching from fact to fiction to nostalgic memoir to after dinner speech.

Most of the short pieces that make up this unusual book are dated, and each date feels like a clock counting down to that fateful date in May of 2001 when the world lost one of its most brilliant, fascinating minds and kindest, gentlest of men. Those of us who were fans recall, as with other great and terrible events of our lifetimes, where we were when we heard the news. I was just finishing my last year at Uni in Scotland. It was the week before exams. My housemates and I were in our common room, joking around and checking email. And then shock, disbelief, sadness. This book is a rag-tag assembly of unpublished and unfinished writing, taken from Adams' hard drive after his death. Most of it is non-fiction, and over the course of it, we get a very personal, eloquent, and (of course) humorous view of his thoughts on things like his inability to meet deadlines, his love of technology and wildlife, and his own atheism. And, saddest of all, his thoughts about and plans for the future that never arrived. I'm glad this book exists. I'm glad to have read it. I don't think I'll be reading it again. You are still most sorely missed, Douglas."}

{"text": "Saladin Ahmed's \"Engraved on the Eye\" offers a nice sampling of Ahmed's short fiction. Collected in this volume are three short stories set in the same world as his first novel, The Crescent Throne, as well as a western, sci-fi, bunnies with swords, and an urban fantasy. Readers unfamiliar with the Crescent Throne will find the stories a good starting point, while fans of Saladin Adhmed's will enjoy the additional background on a certain ghul hunter and his blue clothed dhervish. \n Tying the eight stories of this volume are two themes existing fans will find familiar: the fantastical, told with a heavy Middle Eastern influence. If Bradbury had been Arabic and living in middle America, this is what his first story collection might have looked like, ghul's, djenn, and demons included."}

{"text": "Crosspost: TheReadingBelle.com \n I received Three Dark Crowns in my October Owlcrate box. I didn't have an opportunity to read it back then, but I finally got around to reading it and well, it was an interesting story...Most people loved it, but I felt it was okay. \n Alright, so Three Dark Crown is about three identical sisters who have been separated for years and each one has an equal claim to the throne. The catch is that only one can be queen, and the other two sisters have to be eliminated. Each sister has a unique magical gift, so the readers are led to believe. Mirabella is the strongest rival for the throne. She controls the elements, and she has a strong following of priestesses. Though she seems most likely to become queen, she cannot bring herself to depose of her sisters because she is the only one to have childhood memories of her two sisters. Then there is Katharine who is a poisoner. She can handle any poison...or so readers are led to believe. She's the most fragile compared to the other two sisters. The poisoners group wasn't well explained...but what I got is that before they (the poisoners) were healers. It makes sense. For example, removing poison from patients. Maybe I'm reading too into the book. Anyways, moving on. Lastly, there is Arsinoe who does not have a gift at all. She's supposed to be a naturalist. A naturalist is someone who controls both plants and animals. She constantly admits to other characters that she won't make it when it comes to the tournament. \n The world building was weak. I had many thoughts when reading this book since the author didn't explain much. There were references to the mainland, though the story takes place in the island of Fennbirn. All that I know is that the people of the mainland don't have magical gifts. Other than that, I want to know if the islanders of Fennbirn were exiled into the island, and what type of mythology they have to explain the gifts. There were some references to a goddess, but the author didn't elaborate on it. Yeah, I know I'm going a bit off topic, but I honestly want to know what type of world the characters are living in. \n Moving on to the three queens. I was initially drawn to Katharine because she's the most physically weak, but she's sweet. I really liked how she started becoming more confident throughout the book. As I kept reading, I ended up liking Arsinoe much more than Katharine and Mirabella. Here are the reasons why Arsinoe is the best from the three sisters. \n She is very supportive of her best friend, Jules. \n She is hardworking \n She is tough and brave \n Other than that, I wasn't a big fan of Mirabella. Now, one of the most interesting characters is Jules. She's the strongest naturalist on the island. I really love how Arsinoe respects her friend, and doesn't have jealously at all. There is something special about Arsinoe, but I'll just wait and see for the next book. \n As much as I liked the book, it did have its faults. \n - Information overload during the beginning: Since there are multiple povs in this book, it took me a while to get used to all the characters. So many characters were introduced. \n - Weak world building \n - THE WORST LOVE TRIANGLE: I'm just going to leave this gif here... \n - It was boring: I understand that this is the first book in the series, but there were several dull moments. A lot of flirting happened during most of the book. I felt the book focused a bit too much on the romance. I assumed the sisters were going to be far more scheming...but the minor characters took care of that. The book finally got exciting near the end with an awesome cliffhanger. \n Three Dark Crowns had moments of creepiness, which I highly enjoyed. If you are in the mood for a spooky book, I'd say go with this one. Have patience for Three Dark Crowns...a lot of patience till you get to the second half. That cliffhanger was really good!!! After finishing the book, I'm not sure who will become the next queen. I'm not sure how many books will be in this series, but I am looking forward to the next installment. \n Final Rating: [?][?][?]"}
{"text": "This one is going back to my 'to-read' shelve, I will continue reading it when I have more time for it."}
{"text": "The first half of the book was too much, so much gruesome stuff over and over again. It was tiring. The second half was fun though."}
{"text": "This book is weird. Really, really weird. I guess I would call this a horror version of Alice in Wonderland if I had to call it anything. Or maybe I would call this The Odyssey on all the acid. The lead character Ben goes on a \"hike\" where all kinds of strange and disturbing wackiness ensues. Everything begins when Ben witnesses a hideous masked man disposing of a child's mutilated body. As he flees this murderer and his accomplice he encounters all kinds of fantastical creatures and bizarre situations as he \"stays on the path.\" \n This book is creative and unique. Magary writes short, punchy sentences and while his prose is economical, it's also powerful and he writes some very vivid and arresting scenes. His writing is very cinematic. This feels like a book written with a future TV or film adaptation in mind. It would be very easy to translate to a visual medium. \n The sheer weirdness of this did hold my attention (for a while anyway), and I was curious to see what crazy thing was going to happen next. However, I was put off by the lack of structure and coherence to the narrative. This book was a string of wacky events rather than a traditional narrative. There's not much rhyme or reason to anything. The middle of the book also kind of stalled out for me, as the shock value of the craziness wore off. I like my fantasies with some rules and structure and some world building. Otherwise you just have a grab bag of weird anecdotes strung together, which is what a lot of this book is. The heavily episodic nature of the story means you don't have a lot of characters that you follow over the course of the book which makes it hard for Magary to establish dramatic stakes. I definitely liked things about this but it was also a little too weird for me to fully engage with."}

{"text": "I was not, at all, inclined to read this next installment. I only did it because it feels like a waste of time to not finish the story since I've read all the first three books. I actually felt cheated by the writer when she decided to prolong it more than it needed to be. Really woman...you just needed to let it go. \n Anyway, she decided to extend it and there's no turning back now. I will finish the series and rate each of the books in the exact matter I feel about them. \n Beginning of the book: \n Here we go again...where did we leave off? Oh yeah. Lilith. \n It has been so much already that I need to do a recap before starting each book. I wasn't happy when I started reading this one, but then I remembered that the ending of the last one was pretty good and I kind of really want to see someone punch Sebastian/Jonathan in the face. \n Ending of Part I \n Holy crap. Okay. Breathe, Will. \n I think this part of the book made me remember why I liked the story in the first place. City of Bones was absolutely amazing! (Please don't judge it by the utter horror that they've made as movies and TV shows). While reading through the first part of the book, I felt attracted to the story again and was drawn by the action and intricacy of everything that's happening. Revelations were made and once again, I found myself drawn to the side stories as much as I am to the main one. \n Alec and Magnus <3 Where the hell is that going? No idea. However, Camille is still running around and she's not playing. She makes a revelation that holy moly. \n Simon and Isabelle - Eh...not a fan. I must say, though, that this book does show Isabelle growing as a person and gives a little more insight of who she is as a sister and a whateverisgoingonwithSimon. \n Jordan - I can't remember right now the name of the girl that he's with, but they have a cute story line going on too. However, so much has happened in this books that I kind of...don't...care. \n This part of the book closed off amazingly and I'm really looking forward to the next part. \n Please don't fuck it up. \n Ending of Part II \n I don't know if it's fucked up, but it isn't as good as the first half. There are parts that I like and other parts, the majority, which I hated. I feel like it's so much writing that I grew bored of it. It has literally taken me so long to read the damn book. \n I honestly don't have much to write. \n I like the imagination and where the events are leading. I also liked that the side stories have developed even more. Actually, I'd say most of the growth in this book is of the side stories. \n The names of the last couple of chapter seems promising. \n Let's see what happens. \n End of book \n Okay. I'm conflicted. \n Again, I feel like the story is just dragging, but she did a good job at the end. That last bit of writing was what I needed to read the last book. \n I still believe the story is unnecessary. Sadly, I see room for so many more stories and I'm afraid that she might keep it going past the next book. The story will close out nicely during the next book, I'm sure, but there are so many lose ends now that she needs to tie that I know for a fact the next book will be just as long or even longer than this one. \n I'm happy at the turn of events in this book and again, really like the side stories. I think that everyone is ending up with who they need. I'm not sure what will happen in the vampire universe, but that's probably what I'm most looking forward in the next book. \n Jonathan/Sebastian is bad. Real bad. However, we only know that as readers because of the things he has done. His character doesn't depict him as much and I really didn't get to see the evil in him during this book. If anything, I kind of liked him when he was compassionate and kind. I am, however, looking forward to him being a total badass during the next one. \n Also...Jace and Clary...someone let these two be happy...for the love of God."}
{"text": "Ah, that was good! This was my second try at reading this book. I really enjoyed the first one, but I bounced off of this one on my first try because it takes a really long time to get good. Tess spends the first half of this book being yanked around from one out-of-control situation to the next, plus she really, really is just as appalling a judge of character as Jeck claims! (I don't think that that's much of a spoiler, especially since the claim was in the first book.) \n Of course, at just about exactly the point where I stopped reading last time, things start coalescing, and it all comes together in the end. (I'm not sure I entirely accept the change in {spoiler} at the very end, but the explanation with Tess' unconscious {spoilers} at the very very end do make it fit.) I'd give this book four stars for the ending; the three stars is for the extreme slowness in character development at the beginning. \n Is there a book three yet? Because I really want it!"}

A bit predictable, but satisfactorily brought to a conclusion all the same."}
{"text": "I am both thankful and regretful that I started my journey into Sarah J. Maas work with the A Court of Thorns and Roses series. Those books (especially ACOMAF) are epic yet intricate, complex yet elegant. They are some of the most fun, exciting, and developed Young Adult Fantasy novels out there. They had me hooked, turning me into an instant fan of Maas. Unfortunately, going back to her early work is a somewhat painful, sluggish devolution. \n Throne of Glass has a lot of fantasy tropes and storylines to play with: assassins, princes, soldiers, a deadly competition, a hint of mystery. This all sounds generic because it is. We have all seen these elements again and again in countless stories. It's up to the writer to make them interesting. At this point, I don't think Maas got to flex her writing muscles enough. \n You have all of the hallmarks of her work here. We have some expressive, romantic, visual writing that weaves into the scenes and narration very well. Celeana is another great heroine, and I was very pleased to see she contrasted greatly from ACOTAR's Feyre. She's fierce and incredibly strong without having to sacrifice any of her femininity. From the first fifty pages, these elements sung, and made me excited for the rest. \n However, what you get are generic supporting characters, a generic mystery that does not feel organic to this plot or world, and worst of all little to no resolution. Sure, there's a climax, but Throne of Glass suffers from an unfortunate frequent shortcoming of first novels. The main plot closes up, but almost every other thread is left scattered. It's hard to find any clear character or thematic arcs. \n I am going to continue in this series because I know what Maas is capable of and have heard good things about later entries. I am hopeful that by moving on from the fairly flat set up of Throne of Glass, Maas will venture to more creative and intriguing horizons."}
{"text": "Ten years ago, Victor and his friend Eli decided to prove their theory that when someone survives a death near experience (and they are actually dead for a little while) they become EOs, ExtraOrdinary people with superpowers. But when they experiment on themselves and prove their theory, things go horribly wrong and Victor ends up in prison. Ten years later, he wants revenge. After escaping, he starts his search of Eli with the help of Mitch, his cellmate, and a girl they found gun wounded on the street called Sidney, who turns out is also an EO, and has been shot by Eli and her sister Serena, another EO. They soon realize Eli is trying to kill every EO there is because of what happened with Victor, and only Victor can stop him. \n I loved this story. The characters were dark and interesting, both Victor and Eli so complex and simple at the same time. They are both filled with jealousy and bitterness, both are proud egocentrics and talented at the same time. But while acknowledges his dark side and his lack of empathy, Eli uses his religion to feed his ego and self-righteousness. While the idea that the last thoughts are what define the power that they gain makes total sense, in a way it also ends up defining the characters. Professor Lyne was right in saying they redefine themselves based on their abilities. But they also are a consequence of how they were before dying because their last thoughts are related to their personality. While Victor can give or take pain because of how much painful his death was, it also relates to his personality. Eli can heal, and that gives him the false idea that he has been chosen by God, that he's different from the other EOs. Serena's strong will and personality makes her bend others with only words. Sidney's sweetness makes her give people a second chance at life. \n I really liked how the story develops, how the chapters go between the present and the past, and that there are differents PoV but they don't feel forced or like the story skips from one character to another. I also liked its ending, and at first I thought it was a solo book so I was sad to see so much potential end there. It's a great ending, but I liked the characters so much that while it ended perfectly, I wanted more. \n So Victor killing Serena was surprising, but her letting Sidney go was comforting. It means all Eos are not so broken and detached from feelings. The dog reviving a second time was a big, big plus in my book. At the end, Victor couldn't kill Eli, but killing Serena made the police finally arrest Eli and put him in jail. And Sidney revived Victor, but we don't know if he still has his powers or how she will react when she finds out Eli didn't kill Serena, Victor did. \n Part of me wonders if in the next book they will revive Angie. \n What I wonder is if the series is called Villains because of Victor and his crew. Victor argues that good or bad, villains and heroes are only a matter of perspective, and Eli seems to believe himself a hero, so they definitivly are villains in terms of Eli's perspective. But are there any good people in the story? \n I can't wait for the next book!!"}
{"text": "The second book by the author I have read, and I must admit that I enjoyed this far more than Book of Shadows. Still some problems for me with the characters, although they are better drawn than in the other book. The unexplained sexual tension the main character feels for the two main male characters, although it sometimes seems for anyone with a pulse, is distracting; the plot stokes up well but the denoument is spoiled by too much epilogue. \n It is a nice riff on the work in the Rhine lab, extending reality in this way can be quite false, but Solokoff carries it off well here, without the research being too intrusive. \n A strong 3.5 for me."}

{"text": "4.5 Stars for this YA adventure, fantasy, and romance... \n Ruby is a teen girl unsure how to manage the demands of her Fireblood heritage in a land where being a Fireblood is a death sentence in itself. Born with the ability to wield fire from her hands, she must release some of this power now and then or she feels pent-up and unstable. She always hides deep in the woods outside their remote village to test and release her fire magic, but the day comes when the Frostblood King's soldiers find her and burn their village for daring to \"harbor\" a Fireblood. They also kill her mother right before Ruby's eyes. \n She's imprisoned, kept in a state of complete damp and cold to douse her flames, and starved nearly to death, only to be rescued by a Frostblood master, Brother Thistle, and his protector, Arcus. They vow to save her if she will help them kill the king--and that's a bargain Ruby's all too eager to make. \n Safely ensconced in an abbey to Fors, the god of Frost, Ruby is trained by Brother Thistle in the safe wielding of her flames, and by Arcus in hand-to-hand combat and swordsmanship. Not all the monks are in favor of keeping a Fireblood nearby, however, and view Ruby's training as traitorous to the throne. Over time, Ruby and Arcus develop a camaraderie that slides into attraction. She's there for several months, as the attack on the king is planned for the summer solstice, the time when Ruby's fire magic will be naturally at it's zenith. But, she's frustrated when she learns that the total plan isn't necessarily to kill the king. It turns out that his ice throne, fashioned by Fors a thousand years before, has been corrupted by dark magic, and Thistle and Arcus believe that darkness has inflicted a madness on the king. Perhaps if Ruby melts the throne, she can restore sanity to the king, who can then call off the hunt for Firebloods. \n Ruby isn't in love with this plan, and feels vengeance is hers to claim--but she's captured by the king's soldiers before she and Arcus can mount their siege. Being a Fireblood, Ruby is pressed into the King's gladiatorial entertainment, fully expected to be killed in her first event. When she wins--aided by magic that isn't hers--Ruby knows she's living on borrowed time. If only she can get her flames on the King's throne before her life is snuffed. \n For a fantasy, I really found the realistic development of Ruby as a heroine to be excellent. She's not a quick study. She gets frustrated. She makes mistakes that harm her, and those around her, but she's valiant and determined. Ruby wants to be useful, wants to help herself and all the Firebloods, and Brother Thistle is a patient teacher she wants to please. Arcus is moody and mean-spirited at times, pushing and prodding Ruby to get her off-center. He knows the kind of battles she'll face if they can get her into the King's court, and his tough-love approach felt realistic, as well. Her experiences in the King's court are filled with intrigues, humiliation, and brutality. She's forced to meet her mother's killer many times, even in battle, and Ruby has to keep her wits clear to keep herself alive. The magic that afflicts the King is in play throughout the court--and Ruby's not immune. She has the opportunity to embrace this power, and change her place in the world dramatically, but her deep rapport with Thistle and Arcus keep her grounded in a way she hadn't expected. The worldbuilding is really good, with scenes that are fleshed out and a menacing tone imbued throughout the prose. The juxtaposition of ice and fire was a constant theme, and related not just their powers but also the emotional landscape of the players: hot-headed Ruby has burning passions, while Thistle and Arcus are cool, collected and calculating. \n The love story that develops between Ruby and Arcus is quiet, with only a few moments of acknowledgment before the climax. It seemed a natural progression of their time spent together--from wariness to acknowledgement, to friendship, esteem and eventually attraction. Arcus has a dark history, and his desire to destroy the throne is tied to his intimate knowledge of the king and the monarchy. I was happy that my suspicions regarding his heritage were accurate. I liked the rawness of the experiences that Ruby endures, and how her personal tragedies help forge her into a warrior ready to save herself and those she loves. This book is slated as the first in a series, and ends in a way that completes the initial story arc. There is no cliffhanger, and I expect the next book will have a whole new set of troubles for Ruby to solve--with Arcus at her side."}

{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n I'm trying to take this for what it is, in the knowledge that, without seeing the play, I'm not getting the whole picture, but really ... I dunno. There was a lot here that didn't sit right with me alongside previously published canon. I'm not sure how much of this I can or am expected to accept as being canon. \n None of the adults we grew to know and love from the original Harry Potter series felt like themselves. I cannot imagine Hermione growing up to be Minister for Magic, or Harry having a bad relationship with any of his children, or Ron and Ginny being so ... useless and colourless. Or Draco referring to any of them by their first names. \n To be honest, the whole idea of Voldemort having a secret daughter, possibly involving time travel, felt like something straight out of bad fanfic from the mid-2000s. I could not take it seriously. Every time it was mentioned that Voldemort might have had a child, I started laughing, and when it turned out to be true ... well, all I could do was shake my head. \n I loved the affectionate relationship between Albus and Scorpius. It was everything I wanted it to be. Well, almost everything. Because you can't have a story where two male characters repeatedly affirm their affection for one another without shoehorning in an unconvincing hetero crush for one or both of them, just so it doesn't look too gay. It's 2016, and in a story that went some really dark places, queerness is still apparently one step too far."}

{"text": "I had so many mixed feelings on this book. I loved the writing, liked how the characters fit into the world and enjoyed not getting beat over the head with magic systems. The travel and adventure travel aspect was awesome, too, and made for a powerful second half that contrasted interestingly with the first half, which was a detective noir story set in a medieval city-state. There was something that confused me a lot, and it took me a long time to put my finger on it--the characters didn't have real reactions to things. Not all the time, but the reactions were just off in subtle ways. Anja sometimes gets overly weepy while she's simultaneously being described as being strong. Also, I get it--Mysskeal is tough. That is the point of the story, and yet, there is some strange crap going on with his 'reflexes' and martial art training. Someone pointed out in the r/Fantasy review thread that half of being a great swordsman is footwork, and then it hit me that that's exactly what was wrong with the character for me. There were loads and loads of stakes, but after a point, it wore on me a lot. When the characters didn't feel wooden and weird, the story was immensely powerful. Anja and her crumbling family provided the most heart-wrenching storyline for me, and that woman isn't offered any consolation at any point during the story. Emotionally, Anja takes a beating, and I truly did feel pity for her. In some ways, Wurts refuses to provide a neat ending, so expect more of a bittersweet one than a HEA."}

{"text": "Hollow City was a fast, exciting read. I found it much easier to get into than the first book in the trilogy - probably because fewer explanations of this other world were required. But a big thank you to Ransom Riggs for including the photos of the original peculiar children in the front of the book, along with their names and abilities. I found myself referring back to that often in the earlier chapters as I re-learned who was who. This book picks up minutes after the first book ends and should be read second to that one. The children have escaped the wights and the hollows and the Nazis in the submarine and are rowing their little boats to the mainland of Wales. Their headmistress, Miss Peregrine, is stuck in bird form and they are seeking another ymbryne to restore her to human shape. (I told you, you have to read the first book first). Anyway, the wandering children are in constant danger as they trek through London during the fearsome bombing raids of World War II. And, just like the first book, I have been left hanging in the storyline and must move on to book three. Hopefully, this is a trilogy and my journey is two-thirds over.

A lot of the fun of this book is related to figuring out what the heck is going on, and by the end enough is explained for satisfaction -- and, just as (if not more) importantly, enough is not explained for satisfaction. \n Also, in case your copy of this book doesn't make it clear, this is totally fanfiction of half a dozen Victorian English sources. It would've been a hit at Yuletide."}

{"text": "I'm honestly not sure why there are so negative reviews of this book. It isn't great but it's not that bad considering who it is aimed at. I read it quite quickly and there weren't too many occasions where the book annoyed me. Yes, there could have been more explanation and backstory but I assume that is what the next five books are about. There are plot holes but show me books that don't have them. It was never my objective when picking up this book to find the next master class novel - you just look at the blurb to know exactly what it is going to be - a tried and tested formula that works. It is escapism. And so what if it borrows themes from other books? It isn't as of there are infinite storylines in the world. I like that the author tries to introduce meanings of auras and flowers although the auras are underused in the latter half of the book - very strange considering the figure at the beginning explaining their meanings. Bottom line is, if you want to read a timeless young adult novel read Catcher in the Rye. People put standards on books that aren't intended to be anything other than what they are. I probably would have given this two and a half stars if I could but bumped up to 3 as there were so many one star reviews of it. So if you've got to the end of my rant, if you're a fan of Twilight, Fallen etc you'll probably enjoy this. The first novel is no way as intricate but let's face it, I'm of a age now where getting too involved is exhausting. ;-)"}

{"text": "Note: I received a free copy of Something from its author Shelby Lamb in exchange for an honest review. \n Something, book I in the Wisteria series, by Shelby Lamb is a dark, adult, horror and paranormal novel. And when I say dark, I mean pitch black dark. \n Even though most of the characters are aged 16, I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone under 18. The novel is meant for mature audiences and is high in adult content. There is also lots of profanity, so if you don't like it, read at your own caution. \n \"Bella gasped, delighted, glancing at the red Happy Birthday Bitch written around two fondant boobs and a fondant ass with the exact butterfly tattoo she had on her butt.\" \n Something by Shelby Lamb juggles four main characters, but the main main character is Aubrey Golding, an obsessive emo with suicidal intentions. Aubrey is constantly over-obsessing about her ex-boyfriend, Nathan, who ditched her three months prior. It is interesting to see the obsessiveness and how she struggles with and how Nathan suffers from it. Still I felt it was a little overdone at times. \n Other main characters include Bella, a narcissistic 16-year-old looking to make her name in the porn industry, and 15-year-old Kendra who is pregnant with twins. \n What do all the character have in common? They all talked to or mingled with Aubrey, who has recently picked up a book called Something from the local library. As the book progresses, Aubrey shares bits and pieces with the other three main characters. \n \"Vines bordered the edged of the first page, vines that wiggled and swayed as if they were alive.\" \n I liked how Lamb kept giving the reader bits of information that the characters themselves were unaware of, like creatures hiding in the darkness, pages moving, horns appearing and more. \n \"She hobbled toward the bathroom...not noticing the long, outstretched arm that slid back under her bed. Pale as a sheet, except for the dark veins, it had barely missed her ankle.\" \n A few things about the narration bugged me a bit, sometimes I felt that the author's personal views of her characters entered the narrative, disrupting the flow, and sometimes I felt certain parts could be skipped, particularly with several dialogues and some day-to-day descriptions. Similarly, some of the scary parts could have had shorter sentences instead of \"then\" and other linking words. There were also a few slightly gross, albeit needed, scenes. \n There were also some character discrepancies in Aubrey. Sometimes she was a bit mature or seemed grown up, at others she was like a 10-year-old. \n On the other hand, among the things I liked about Something was Shelby's use of thought-provoking similes and imagery throughout. \n While I'm usually not a fan of love triangles, Lamb's triangle is well-crafted, maintaining suspense. \n I liked how the author made me like and dislike Aubrey at the same. Just like Aubrey's conflicting world, the reader is made to feel conflicting emotions about her. While I often pitied her, there were times when she irritated me. In her fit of rage, I was totally rooting for her though. \n \"She closed the door, not noticing the strange, horned creature sitting by Aubrey's sleeping body, hunching over her like a dark, ominous cloud. \n That night, while everyone slept, a pale, smooth and slender hand placed a gift box down on the doorstep. He had found Aubrey once again. \n He always would.\" \n Normally, Something is not a book I would have picked up, but I'm glad I got out of my reading genres and read this. \n Something is a quick-paced, scary novel with short chapters and several lives intermingled, making the book interesting at all times. Highly recommended. \n \"I can smell the Demonolib curse on you.\" \n Overall rating: 4.75 stars"}

{"text": "Book three of the Dagger and the Coin - it rises up like Ouroboros writ in words, the ending is the beginning and the beginning is the ending. This third installment brings us back to the world of Marcus and Kit as they go looking for a magical sword to kill a Spider goddess with. Meanwhile, in the sexy world of moneylending, Cithrin continues her struggle and education in service to the Medean Bank. \n Orbiting like a love struck puppy - with a cadre of killer priests and a warring nation at his command - Geder Palliako continues down his self destructive path, the ridiculed, chubby nerd that now wields more power than he knows how to handle or deal with. Meanwhile, working her wily ways to bring all that Geder stands for down, Clara continues her secret campaign with the street urchins and disheveled of Camnipol. \n While the book is not for newcomers - there is simply too much background to explain, about a book and a half to be exact - it is a worthy addition to the series on whole. The pace is fast, the action is tight, and the world, as always, teeters on an unseen precipice ready to dip even further into chaos. As the midway point in the series, I think it's sometimes hard to see the events that happen as the turning points they really are. \n Recommended for epic fantasy readers, but don't start here."}

{"text": "4.5 stars \n Book provided by Netgalley for review and honest opinion. \n Interesting story about love that transcends time. I have never read a story like it. I have to say I enjoyed it. More of a review to come. \n The story of Megan Miller and her love of seventies music, specifically that of Davy Morgan. She has decided to do her thesis for her doctorate of the sociology of seventies music and festivals. She has traveled from Sydney, Australia to London for the Glastonbury festival, to collect data to finish her thesis. What she did not expect was to meet the hot, young, bad boy rocker, that lives in the cottage next door to her. What she cannot figure out is that he is the spitting image of her teenage crush Davy Morgan. \n When she sees David disappear into the fields behind their cottages one day, Megan goes to look for him and what she finds is nothing short of crazy. Nothing seems the same in the town she just came through. The people at the festival are very different and the way the festival is run is nothing like those of the current time. David tries everything he can to protect her from the truth, but in the end fills her in on, telling her about the ley lines in the field. After having the most amazing night of her life with David, she feels the connection that she has to him growing stronger. \n Will they be able to make a relationship work? Is the love that they have found in one another strong enough to stand the test of time? \n I found this book to be fairly well written, I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for an awesome love story. This is the first book that I have read by this author and it will not be the last. It is also the first book that I have read with this type of story line."}
{"text": "This is one of those books you wish you could give more than 5 stars. Zafon is one of those artists who paints, with his words, in a multitude of media all at once. Diffused watercolors, bold, bright oils, soft, blended pastels and hard, cutting lines of darkest ink, all swirling and dancing across the pages, mezmerizing, yet simultaneously solid. A firmament of reason and familiarity that leaves you with a smile on your face. Comforting while at the same time able to shake you to the core, leave you grinding your teeth. \n \"Prisoner\" is the third novel of Zafon's I've read and is quite possibly the best of the three. If you've read any of his work you'll know that's a tall order. It meandered at a point, in a slightly drunken way, but sobered quickly and left me turning pages, unable to stop reading until I saw what ends his characters were moving toward. Even in its completion \"Prisoner\" leaves some questions unanswered, but not in a terribly frustrating way. You find yourself transported, standing on a wrought iron balcony looking out over a Spanish city at sunrise, the colors both muted and sharp, and smiling to yourself, knowing it could only be that way."}
{"text": "The last half of this book was really good. It was exciting, intense and satisfying. The first half was a whole lot of back story and stuff that didn't matter. Many characters introduced were unnecessary or at least given too much page time. Most of what was built then in characters and story could have been done in a much more compact way. There were times I skimmed the pages early on. But as I said, the second half was what I wanted. The relationship between Puck and Sean was intriguing and refreshing, having been built on trust rather than sexual attraction. And thought the actual races were very short, it was the perfect length, and I thought the ending was sweet and perfect."}

{"text": "2.5 stars \n I don't even know where to begin. Half of this book was a giant one star and the other half was PFM five stars. So basically...I went for right down the middle. \n So. Plot. \n Aiden is a bear shifter and his ginormous military buddies are all sorts of different things. Vampires, Fae, shapeshifter, bears, wolves, the whole shebang. They have paranormal cities right along side normal human ones. Apparently, the men aren't getting their mates quickly enough so Aiden's mother decides to do a spell to bring the mates to them. Enter Meryn, nerdy woman-child extraordinaire. She up and decided to move and decided to stick a dart into a map to decide where. Surprise surprise, she is drawn to Aiden. She decides to climb a random fence and ends up on the paranormal private property that houses Aiden and his men. From there we have a ridiculous albeit hilarious case of kidnapping your mate because she doesn't really understand why this huge man is sniffing her hair and insisting that she is his. For once, the heroine actually fights. Including attacking Aiden with the back of his toilet and throwing things at his head. I'm not going to lie, I thought that was pretty smart. I silently added it to my \"if I ever get kidnapped and thrown in a bathroom, I'll remember to do ____\" list. \n From there we have the standard \"you're the hottest man I've ever seen\" and the \"Is she really my mate? We are so different!\" thing. Unfortunately, we also have one the quickest instaloves in all of instalovelandia. It takes two days for the two of them to admit they love each other. Two days. The only thing that really saved it was the fact that sometimes it's nice to read a book that doesn't spend 200 pages getting the characters together. Instead, the love comes easy and the rest is spent on other stuff. The rest of the book is spent with Meryn in danger and her amazing everyone around her with her love of four-letter words and lack of a filter. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love four letter words, but it was a little too forced here. You don't need your character to ask if someone would pass the fucking coffee or the fucking salt for me to understand she isn't a simpering ass kisser. Moving on. \n I think this book suffered from just trying to be too much. Everything was forced. There was nothing subtle about it. Fortunately, in one way, it totally worked. The humor. Holy shit. There were so many funny lines I highlighted. There was one scene that quite literally had me in tears. Like clutching my sides out of breath kind of funny. It's a scene I don't think I'll ever forget. Ever. I think it alone is responsible for two of the three stars on my rating. Without ruining too much of the fun, I'll say this. Apparently, paranormals have different \"cycles\". I put it that way because that is the word that is used in the book. You know, Aunt Flo. Eventually, Meryn needs tampons. Aiden, of course, has never even heard of tampons. When Meryn tries to describe exactly how her cycle works to her lovely protective mate, she goes with the most medical description she can. When he hears the words \"bleeding\" and \"internally\" he freaks the hell out. It eventually leads to this little gem. To set the scene a little, Aiden and his scary looking paranormal military buddies are in a drugstore at the register with fifteen boxes of tampons. \n \"Son, how violent is yer woman?\" the older man asked sounding curious. \n Aiden leaned in and whispered, \"She knocked me unconscious once with the back of my toilet.\" \n The older man's eyes widened. \"Better get you some chocolate bars. You can throw those from a distance.\" \n The book is peppered with little beauties like that. Like I said, PFM. \n As far as what I didn't like? Meryn. I was not a fan. She was funny, I'll give you that. But she was also very annoying. I just didn't like how far the author went to make her an anti-romance heroine. She was 34, had a pixie cut, only wore converse sneakers and terrible t-shirts, and she loved to drown herself in hoodies 3 sizes too big. She also wore a backpack everywhere and would throw a tantrum if someone touched her laptop. She made constant Star Wars references and was confused as to why none of the paranormal folks didn't know what Doctor Who was. Don't get me wrong, these things alone aren't an issue but together it just seemed so forced. I love a unique heroine who isn't a 5'10 willowy blonde with hair down to her waist and three-mile legs. But come on. They way she was described made her sound 17. The way she acted made her sound 17. The way she spoke made her sound 17. It just didn't work for me. When things didn't go her way she basically had a tantrum and called everyone around her an asshole. Like a giant woman-child. \n Nein Danke. \n I liked Aiden. He was pretty standard. There was the obligatory possessive freak out but I didn't hold it against him. That's almost a prerequisite for any \"mate\" kind of romance. He was sweet and did everything he could to make her happy. No complaints there. \n I enjoyed the world building. There is enough set up for tons of books to come. I liked that. I loved the little details and all of the things that weren't explained. It makes me want to read the next book. This isn't a gut-wrenching angsty book. This is the kind of book to read if you aren't feeling well or need a laugh and a brain vacation. Which lately, describes me perfectly. As much as I had to complain about, which was a lot, I would still recommend it."}

{"text": "Podczas gdy Poison Study jest nazywane Study 1, Assasin Study okresla sie mianem Study 1.5. Jest to krotka historia, ktora jest po prostu dodatkiem, nie wnoszacym nic do fabuly. To krotkie opowiadanie ma za zadanie najprawdopodobniej przyblizyc nam nieco postac Valka i tym razem poznajemy wydarzenia z jego perspektywy. Troche przeszkadza mi fakt, ze Assasin Study powstalo w rok po zakonczeniu trylogii i 4 lata po wydaniu Poison Study, jednak tu juz sie czepiam szczegolow. W koncu wydanie wydaniem, moze napisala to wczesniej. \n Historia jest bardzo krotka ale tresciwa, utrzymana w klimacie pierwszej czesci cyklu. Nie zabraklo momentow emocjonujacych, za co jestem bardzo wdzieczna. Jedyne do czego sie chce przyczepic to oczywiscie Valek. Zaczynajac od najmniej istotnego aspektu, zaskoczyla mnie nieco okladka. Nie lubie jak ktokolwiek rysunkami czy okladkami mi sie wtrynia w moje wyobrazenia o postaciach. Od pierwszych stron postac Valka wyobrazalam sobie jako szczuplego wysportowanego ale jednak dojrzalego faceta (mniej wiecej 30+), ze szpakowatymi wlosami (pomimo uwag autorki o kruczoczarnych wlosach i niebieskich oczach moja dusza uparla sie widziec go inaczej). Wiedzialam tez, ze ma te wlosy mniej wiecej do ramion. Moje wyobrazenie jednak pozostalo gluche i nieczule na sugestie autorki. Ja go widze jako krotkowlosego szczuplego, szpakowatego faceta okolo 40. Okladka byla pierwszym co mi troszeczke zgrzytalo. Podczas czytania rzadko zdarza mi sie rownoczesnie patrzec na okladke wiec dosc szybko przestalam o tym myslec. \n Nie moglam sie przyzwyczaic, ze tym razem widzimy swiat jego oczami. Zapewne nie protestowalabym, a wrecz przywitalabym z otwartymi ramionami jego narracje na samym poczatku Poison Study, ale nie kiedy jego glownym zmartwieniem jest Yelena i jej bezpieczenstwo. Dosc malo wiarygodnie i malo przekonujaco wypadl w roli bezlitosnego assasina (uwielbiam to slowo <3), kiedy rozczula sie nad ukochana kobieta. Lubie postaci mocne, silne, nieugiete, ktore sobie radza w kazdej sytuacji. Lubie cieple romanse osob po ktorych romansu sie nie spodziewam. Ale do diabla obie te rzeczy razem nie daja w efekcie niczego dobrego. Nieugieta, silna postac robi sie rozmamlana co bardzo negatywnie wplywa na odbior watku romantycznego. Gdyby wpleciono kilka komediowych elementow moze nie bylabym taka niezadowolona, ale nie wpleciono. Na dodatek Valek zaczal robic za dobrego Samarytanina, ktory ratuje kobiety i dzieci. Ja wiem, ze i duzo wczesniej Valek byl facetem z zasadmi. Wyszlo to podczas rozmowy z Yelena, byl ewidentnie urazony i rozczarowany, ze uznala, ze on potrafi rozwiazywac problemy tylko mordujac. Z Assasin Study wyciagnelam jeden istotny wniosek, ze Yelena go dosc mocno zmienila. Juz wczesniej jak sam to mowil napsula mu mnostwo krwi i caly czas sie musial o nia martwic i dbac o jej bezpieczenstwo. Teraz jeszcze musi sie zmagac z dzielaca ich odlegloscia. Ale abstrahujac od pierwszego niezbyt dobrego wrazenia po przemysleniu uznalam, ze autorka jest konsekwentna i naprawde spokojnie moglby to byc rodzial Poison Study. Bez szkody dla fabuly, wrecz przeciwnie. Szkoda, ze nie dostajemy wiecej mozliwosci patrzenia na swiat oczami Valka."}

Just when she is convinced that every male in the entire human race is scum, she meets Vane Kattalakis. Vane is gorgeous, sweet, caring, rich and treats her like she is the most precious thing in his life. He's damn near perfect. For a werewolf. \n Bride and Vane's courtship is electric, and the suspense element keeps the story quick-paced and exciting. The Dark-Hunter world is one that readers will be eager to visit again and again. \n Jumping right into the middle of the Dark Hunter series (this is book 6- oops) was a bit jolting at first, but the storyline was rich enough, the characters engaging enough and the romance spicy enough to more than make up for any slight confusion from secondary characters or mythology threads. This book was a lot of fun."}

A girl gets struck by lightning and after seeing pictures of people - such as the missing kids on the back of a milk carton - and some sleep she knows where those people are. Now, she doesn't freak out about this...too much. Jess instead does the right thing, and calls the 1-800-WHERE-R-YOU hotline and reports the locations of these kids. Obviously, because she keeps doing this, people start to get interested on how exactly she knows this and the FBI gets involved."}
{"text": "I found Blood of Ambrose a bit of a tough read. It was quick but it didn't seem to read very quick (if that makes sense). The language was hard to follow. \n This Crooked Way is a lot easier to read. The writing flows a lot better. With that said this book is filled with little episodes that sorta connect together but don't really. I personally enjoyed the parts that were just Morlock a lot better before he hooked up with that family. I found the parts where the family told stories a bit dull and I didn't really care for those. \n Since this book is filled with little episodes it doesn't flow as smoothly as book should. In fact it felt a bit off as if someone is telling me stories and they should go together and I know they should but I can't figure out why they don't. \n I enjoyed it and just wish there was more of just Morlock. Overall a better smoother read however the stories don't line up as well as I would have liked."}

{"text": "It was already a month ago from today that I started reading this book, and finally, I have finished it! (School got in the way) I wanted to read this book because I saw good reviews about it and I've seen its movie and I enjoyed it as well. As usual, the film adaptation was different from the book, but it was ok, beyond ok actually because I think that the movie was better than the book. It's not that I didn't like reading it; I just understood the movie more. \n The novel was a bit dragging. I wasn't really hooked up with the story but getting to know Lena and her capabilities was exciting. Her connection with Ethan was totally enviable, who wouldn't want to talk to your love one without actually saying a word? It's really sweet and intimate. I loved how Ethan protected Lena even though he was just a mere mortal. Lena's want to belong to the human world was adorable. I kind of get why she wanted to belong. I felt that too, before. \n The setting of the story was unique. It took me a while to adjust to it, but then I grew accustomed to where they were. The \"caster\" thing ate me up. I badly want to be one, a Light Caster, that is. It would be awesome to have any kind of powers. :D \n The character I liked most in the novel was Macon and I really became sad when he died even though I already know that he would be basing on the movie I saw. He really loved Lena, he did his best to protect her, and he was really honorable. And how could I forget Boo Radley. That dog, I would love to have him as a pet. HAHA \n The most annoying character I encountered on this read was Emily. She was just a pain in the butt. I really did not like her, I bet you wouldn't too if you read this because she was just a huge trouble maker, and a miss-goody-two-shoes-on-the-outside-but-really-evil-on-the-inside. She and Savannah were b*tches. I actually felt glad when Ridley ruined their prom. HAHAHA \n Overall, I liked the characters, just not so much of the story. Its concept is unique and unlike any other, it's just cliche because of its love story. The boy will do anything for the one he loves and they will end up together happily, a really predictable story. But it was still a thrilling read anyway. \n Famous Quote: \"Mortals. I envy you. You think you can change things. Stop the universe. Undo what was done long before you came along. You are such beautiful creatures.\" - Macon Ravenwood"}

{"text": "I met the author at a conference and asked what her book was about. \n \"Well, a doctor discovers that she has the power to walk through dreams after a patient spontaneously combusts in her ER, and she learns about--\" \n \"Stop,\" I said. \"You had me at spontaneous combustion.\" \n This is a tricky plot to place, probably technically an urban fantasy but a lot more fantasy than urban. I'd probably give BETWEEN a 4.5 if I could; I kept wanting to come back to it (good!) but got a bit confused in trying to work out all that was going on (how and why?). Our heroine has a probably-realistic confusion and reluctance at the beginning, but she dragged her feet too much at the end for my personal taste. Also, I like a sharp sense of time and action in my fantasy, while this had a more dreamy feel -- which is wholly appropriate for the story, so that's nothing but my own preference surfacing. \n There's some left unexplained -- why was Flynne hypothermic? how are the \"dream\" personalities connected to the \"real\" ones, and are they responsible for one another? was the [spoiler] real or not? -- but a sequel or two coming, so maybe all will be explained. \n But it has dragons and magic and dreams and spontaneous combustion, so worth a look."}
{"text": "Not as good as the first book in plot or writing. Still cute and good for laughs. \n Even before venturing into the series, I hadn't planned on reading more then the first two books. Oddly, I feel compelled to read the third book Blameless. It is that feeling you get when you know something bad will happen and you can't seem to look away combined with the guilty pleasure of watching soap operas or 90210. Thankfully the author embraces the campy/pulp fun of it all so I shall do the same."}
{"text": "I really liked this series, and this book was a great addition. Overall, this entire franchise of Darren Shan's is great and although I'm personally not a very big vampire person, I did enjoy this and The Vampire's Assistant books that I've read so far, a lot. I absolutely love the way that he created a reality in which a majority of things that are common knowledge about vampires are actually false."}
{"text": "Bedknobs and Broomsticks was one of my favourite Disney movies as a child, but somehow I never got around to reading the books it was based on (two books, here combined in a single volume) until now. \n The books are, of course, very different. The movie is set during WWII, with the children being sent into the countryside to avoid the London Blitz, and are housed with Miss Price, which I think makes for a stronger setting than merely having her be a neighbour of their great aunt, as she is in the books. \n The character of Emilius Jones (or Brown, in the movie) is substantially different, being a resident of 17th century London in the books, whom the children meet on one of their adventures on the magical bed. He is not quite as much of a charlatan and con man as he is in the movie, though he is a professional necromancer who doesn't really believe in magic. \n All of the children's adventures, and Miss Price's attitude towards magic are very different in the books than in the movie. In some ways I am glad they were changed. The adventure on the \"cannibal\" island, complete with stereotypical natives, is uncomfortable reading for a modern reader, and was best left out. \n Intrasubstantiary Locomotion (Substitutiary Locomotion in the movie) plays a much smaller but still key role in the climax of the story, but no one ever turns into a rabbit. Miss Price and Carey are, over all, the strongest characters in the story. The books have a different but still bittersweet ending. \n Very enjoyable and charming."}

I really wanted to like this book but sadly I didn't. 2 stars."}
{"text": "I loved this book. I thought the writing was a bit simple for YA but it was quick and fast paced that made me feel like I didn't want to put the book down.

{"text": "I was not a fan of the first book. I thought it was really just plunked down and thrown together. But wow did the Salvatores get it together with this book. \n This book is still very much a YA book. It's written in first person, the young main character, the themes are all elementry YA and not too in depth. But Geno seems to have grown leaps and bounds in this book. \n There was just so much more structure to this book and there was a flow of moments of no action to action instead of a long period of no action then bam bam bam action. \n Still not a fan of cliffhanger endings. This has one but I will NEVER like cliffhanger endings like this. If you want a cliffhanger ending have some form of ending not just look the bad guys are coming and THE END. :)"}

Weird, but fun."}
{"text": "Absolutely loved this book!"}
{"text": "WOW. I have been following this while it was a work in progress and sometimes I was a little sorry because SRB's mastery of tension is amazing and quite frustrating for a reader who cannot read further. \n The world building is simply fantastic, with a lot owed to the authors that inspired her to write this adventure in the first place but much that is hers alone. \n The characters are fascinatingly flawed, the dialogue witty, hilarious and heartbreaking by turns and I simply CANNOT wait to read the sequel contained in \"Monstrous Affections\" about Luke's adventures. \n Did I mention it's free online and also complete? \n Second read: 29/11/2014(Have read the sequel now, \"Wings in the Morning\", the most amazing pun in the story of elegant titles and also super satisfying as a conclusion for now of all the romances in \"Turn of the Story\".) \n Third read 21/07/2016: Read the Italian translation (and how lucky am I? I've been studying Italian for the last two years and I get my favourite story translated into it!) and fell even more in love. Then re-read \"Wings in the Morning\", which itself left me wondering how it could be read without TTotS but whatever, yummy and sweet."}
{"text": "This book sucked me right in. Maggie Stiefvater has a way with words, particularly images. The mood was sullen and brooding, the main characters both obsessive and intense. They had good reason to be that way since there were some dark themes and the male lead had led a hard life. The pacing was a bit slow for me, just because it was a book about werewolves and I expected more action I guess. But as a relationship book it worked rather well."}

{"text": "Review originally posted on journeyintotheshelves.tumblr.com & journeyintotheshelves.wordpress.com \n **I received a copy of this eBook courtesy of the author. This has had no bearing on this review. \n So what happens after the fairytale ending? Everyone always expects that the heroes of the story really do live happily ever after. David Meredith's The Reflections of Queen Snow White explores the possibility that it's not as simple as that. \n Taking place years after her fairytale ending, Snow White, now queen, is consumed by her depression and helplessness after the passing of her Prince Charming; not even her daughter's wedding will bring joy back to her heart. In an attempt to find some solitude, she uncovers a dusty, unused room where she finds her stepmother's old magic mirror. From there, she goes on an personal journey through her memories to reveal parts of herself that she may have long forgotten. Meredith's The Reflections of Queen Snow White is a true character study that delves deeper into the life of Snow White than few have experienced before. Through the mirror's \"reflections\" we experience the wickedness of her stepmother, fall in love with Charming, and learn what it really takes to rule a kingdom. \n Though a quick read, Meredith's work is enjoyable and addresses some major themes, such as how to cope with the loss of a loved one, in a simplistic, yet relatable way. The memories and backstory that Meredith adds to Snow White's story are fascinating and different, but still captures the essence of the original story. The writing flows easily and fits with the setting and voice of the time period. I'm going to be honest, sometimes I was very glad that my kindle has a built in dictionary, but it all still fit within the parameters story. My one issue with this book is that it is a bit too short. The ending felt just a bit rushed and needed to be expanded to really round out Snow White's character arc. \n Overall, The Reflections of Queen Snow White is a quick, enjoyable read that discusses how to find hope in darkness, and how to truly believe in oneself."}
{"text": "Buku pertama dari The Lunar Chronicles yang membuat saya mengenal seorang penulis brilian; Marissa Meyer. Awalnya saya less expectation saja ke buku ini. Saya sudah melihat bagaimana bookstagrammer luar negeri heboh sekali membahas betapa bagusnya buku ini, ditambah juga dengan book-blogger di luar negeri yang lagi-lagi sering membahas Cinder dan memuja-muji, tapi saya masih ragu untuk membacanya karena saya pikir akan sama saja dengan buku-buku distopia modern yang banyak mengecewakan saya dan ujung-ujung fokusnya lebih ke romance. Itulah kenapa saya cenderung antipati ke distopia modern, dan lebih tertarik untuk membaca yang klasik. \n Tetapi, TLC -- well, technically Cinder dulu sebelum buku-buku selanjutnya dari seri ini -- membuka mata saya bahwa masih ada buku dengan genre ini, yang dibuat di era modern, dan ditulis dengan begitu bagus. Walaupun agak lama untuk saya warm-up ke Cinder, tapi saya menikmati kisahnya sampai akhir. Konsep retelling dongeng dunia, di sini kisahnya Cinderella, juga menjadi bagian yang menarik. Sampai saya mencari Cinderella-retold lainnya lagi."}

{"text": "This is my fave installment in the series. Sasha and Stefan are--without question--attached. Stefan has sent for a Council elder to verify Sasha's superior magical rank, and to have a Mage come to train her. For some reason, Sasha's magic doesn't seem to work the way Stefan's people are accustomed. \n Every time she tries to cast a spell, it ends in a fiery disaster. Hopefully Toa, the White Mage, can help her sort out the trouble because Sasha is being sent as Stefan's emissary to the nearby shifter population to help secure an alliance against their mortal enemy, Trek, and his minions. If Sasha is successful she will elevated to the rank of full Mage and will be considered a worthy match for a clan leader--namely Stefan--so she is determined to work hard toward this goal. \n Sasha is accompanied by her stalwart--and horny--protector Charles, and Jonas--a good friend of Stefan but someone who had sworn to get revenge against Sasha in the first book. Neither Sasha, nor Charles are certain where Jonas' loyalty lies, however, and they both have serious reason to believe he will not protect Sashs should Trek turn up in the shifter camp. \n And, of course, Sasha's confidence is shattered when her rival for Stefan's affection, Darla, arrives as \"back up\". Sasha is sure this is a \"No Confidence\" vote on Stefan's part and begins to doubt that she will complete her mission--to gain the shifter alliance--which will mean that she and Stefan cannot be linked. \n As it happens, Trek hits the shifter camp hot and hard. A supposed protector is truly a traitor and Sasha must choose between leaving the shifter camp in full battle to protect herself, or turning back to help her new friends. As this is an adventure/erotic romance you can guess the choice she makes. \n It's a satisfying end, with an epic battle that proves Sasha's true worth as both a human and a Mage. The resolution hints at further installments, but the series is fairly well-wrapped. Had a great time with Charles--Sasha always seems to get the better of him, Watch Captain or no. I think the best part of the book was the uncertainty surrounding Jonas and Darla. Both had good reason to want Sasha in harms way, but one did the right thing and proved his/herself the supreme protector. \n It's a fun spicy adventure, but there was far less spice and far more adventure which seemed to be the right mix for me this go-round. Again, not recommending this for young readers. Whole lotta lovin' goin' down..."}

{"text": "I feel about this book pretty much the same way I felt about volume two, Dark Triumph. It is a great character study. Annith, like Ismae and Sybella before her, was an interesting protagonist with a fascinating backstory. I also enjoyed the theological orientation of this installment. \n However, also like book two, I found the plot sluggish. It takes a long time to get going and the final resolution to Duchess's plot relies heavily on a deus ex machina I found totally underwhelming. I feel like the first book had such a rich, complex plot where these last two volumes had enough plot for one book stretched out over two. \n All three of these books offer beautiful writing, well developed characters and interesting mythology. The quality of plotting definitely declines after the first book. Still a series worth reading though for sure."}

{"text": "Wow. Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow. That was something. I wasn't sure I was going to read this book. I couldn't find it on one of the library apps and therefore had to make more of an effort to request it and pick it up at a branch. I then didn't make it to the library in the time I had to pick it up and had to request it again. Then once I did have it, I accidentally listened to the first CD on shuffle and was thoroughly confused. So all in all, it was an adventure to get into the story but once I did, I was blown away. This is a fairy tale, but not the type that leaves you with the warm fuzzies. This is one that will break you open and make you feel. The main character is a 13 year old boy trying to keep it together while his mother deteriorates from cancer, a bully picks on him daily, a grandmother constantly on his case, and a father who has clearly moved on to his new family and can't spare much thought for Conor. You can't help but feel for him and you get caught up in sympathizing and empathizing with him as he deals with the fear of losing someone he loves. \n If you're wondering who the Monster is, don't assume it's the cancer, it isn't, it's so much more. It's a tree that's also a storyteller and he agrees to tell Conor three stories in exchange for the truth, Conor's truth. Conor just needs to figure out what that truth is."}

Paige is one tough cookie of a main character! I like her rebellious nature and how she isn't fearful of much at all, yet she has kept from becoming hard or calloused and cruel. She isn't naive or gullible either. She truly understands what needs to be done for rebellion to happen and tries to make her moves in ways that will advance her politically. The girl gets beaten up so much through this book that you can't help but be impressed. I'm looking forward to the next one!"}

{"text": "Technically I did finish this book today. Of course, it was at 2:00 this morning. Book Three of The Strain trilogy continues to ramp up the horror and evil that were laid out in the first two installments. It is a dark, dreary and depressing story. The Master has effectively taken over the world. At the end of Book Two, his minions have caused meltdowns at nuclear power plants which then resulted in nuclear bomb strikes from several countries who thought they were being attacked. They were - but from within, not from other nations. This global catastrophe caused multiple volcanic eruptions. The end result is a planet that has been terraformed for vampires. The sky is dark except for two hours a day of weak sunlight. The black rain falls almost continuously. But most horrifying of all is the new society that has emerged. The Master's vampires killed over a third of humanity in the first 72 hours. They specifically targeted the rich, the powerful, the brilliant, the strong, the brave, etc. The remaining humans are those who are easily controlled. Some are herded into camps where they are bred and raised as food (apparently B positive is the Kobe beef of blood). The others work at meaningless jobs and return to their homes each night to watch endless re-runs on TV. And most of them have adjusted to this new reality and comply with the vampires. There are only a few who continue their quest to find the book that will tell them how to destroy the Master (and then to interpret it). This story, and in fact the entire series, is not for the faint of heart. No matter how many times you think that you have reached the depths of depravity, Guillermo del Toro and Chuck Hogan will taken you even deeper into the horror of their vision. I do not recommend reading it late at night. In fact, I am now going to go select a nice romance and try to purge The Night Eternal from my brain."}
{"text": "If you are looking for a traditional cozy mystery, this isn't it. But it is a great read. The premise caught my attention at first- I love the combination of mystery and paranormal-but the reviews seemed split. I decided to make my own decision. I'm so glad I did. \n The main character is a loser detective who wakes up to discover he's dead. Despite being a poor excuse for a husband, father and cop, he wasn't sent right to hell, and he definitely didn't get a ticket to the Pearly Gates. He's trapped in no man's land condemned to watch his life go on without him, alone, as a ghost. This would make anyone start reassessing how they lived and what they'd lost. I suspect this is what is throwing some readers off this book; the author uses very deep point of view in first person and I really felt he nailed it. This is a story about a dead cop being given a sort-of chance to right the screw ups of his career. When a ghost from his past finally shows up, he grabs onto the hope he has a shot at redemption, or at least escape from the monotony of his new existence. And that's where the intriguing mystery comes in. By the end, he fixes one of his past mistakes, and finds out how his own death occurred. \n No promises but you get the feeling he might yet earn that ticket to Heaven ... eventually. This was the first book in the Dead Detective series. I'm dying to read the next one."}

{"text": "This story has wings! \n The shadows have always followed Luce around ever since she can remember, but after speaking to her parents about it once, they sent her to numerous psychiatrists, certain she must be suffering from a mental illness. This does not bode well for Luce, always having to lie about the shadows, and thinking there is something wrong with her but never quite knowing what. This turns her into an angry teenager always getting into trouble. So much so, she ends up being sent away to a reform school called the Sword and Cross. Although she is not happy about it, and misses her best friend and parents, things soon look up when she comes face to face with Daniel - the moody, secretive, untouchable boy who she swears she has met before. But Luce is hiding a few secrets of her own. Before coming to Sword and Cross she had a scholarship to a prestigious boarding school revoked when she was blamed for the accident that caused the death of her boyfriend, and it so traumatised her it led to the loss of her memory of the incident. Or so she is lead to believe. \n Meanwhile, the alluring, yet equally mysterious bad boy, Cam, has set his sights on Luce causing her to feel torn between both him and Daniel. But of course it's Daniel she really wants and feels she has a connection with. So, with her new school friend's help she tries to find out more about him and is shocked at what she learns, not only about Daniel, but herself. The shadows are no figment of her imagination, and she has a past connection with Daniel that changes everything. Throughout her life, all her lives in fact, Daniel has been her protector - her guardian angel. But that's not all, Luce finds herself in the middle of a war, and it's fight or flight time between good and evil. Will the dark, sad truth of her relationship with Daniel ever be revealed? One kiss is all it takes to change everything, but is it for the best? \n Oh, what a lovely, Gothic love story, thriller and suspenseful read all rolled into one. The premise of a love that cannot be, may not be a new one, but with a flutter of fallen angels waging a war against each other, the story grows wings and takes on a new life of its own. I could not put it down. However, the ending did seem to lack something by leaving a key question unanswered. Yes, I know there's going to be a sequel and Lauren Kate wants to keep us hooked, and maybe I'm just being too impatient, but it did leave me feeling a little cheated at the end. Despite this, it wasn't enough to destroy my reading experience. I truly did enjoy discovering the secrets of Luce and Daniel's developing romance, and what she had unknowingly walked into that would change her life forevermore."}

{"text": "See full review for Oblivion at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n The ruling theme in 2015? Taking the first book of a popular series that was told in a the female protagonist POV and switching it to the male love interest. A good chunk of the time I don't waste my time with books like this because I don't want to re-read a book just to get the guy's point of view but lately the authors who have good male characters have been releasing these books. \n Oblivion is the re-telling of Obsidian from Daemon's point of view and because I purchased it through the iBookstore I also got Onyx and Opal told from Daemon's POV. And I have to say it was worth the $6.99 I spent."}

{"text": "4 Steamy Vamp Stars \n I did beta read Adina Falling and never did I think it'd be so steamy... Geez, it was pretty hot ladies. \n Adina is a vampire and an author for erotica -if she writes about her sex life in her novels no wonder she's a bestseller ;) \n She's single and enjoys her life after her marriage, which was more than a mistake, ended . Her ex is literally a psycho that gives you the creeps!! He's still somehwat present in Adina's life... he threatens her because he has his eyes everywhere- seriously creepy! \n Her mother is like every mother and tries to play match-maker with her daughter, because if Adina doesn't settle down the vampire elders will match her -and that wouldn't end well. So, Adina has no other choice then to agree to meet Xander for a blind date. A date her mom, of course, organized... \n But in between Adina is doing what she does best...satisfying her hunger, but she doesn't just feed off of anybody, no, she has a specific type of men she feeds from. The ones that sin and are the scumbags of society -cheaters, liars, and betrayers. \n But this is just a small part of the story... \n Adina has nightmares; terrible nightmares that leave her clueless what they could or do mean.... all she remembers from her dreams is this sickening feeling that something is going to happen...something bad. She doesn't see faces in her dreams, besides of one... the face of the most handsome vampire she has ever seen. His body is to-die-for!! \n To forget her nightmare Adina goes out clubbing wih her friends where she meets Caleb -LADIES, he's extremely handsome and just wait till you read their hot meet 'n' greet ;) He basically swoops Adina off her feet... But she promised to go on this blind date with Xander... \n ....little did she know that Xander would play a bigger role in her life than that of just a blind date. \n Melissa did a great job writing a steamy novella with modern vampires. Adina is a interesting character and her nightmares leaves you wanting to find out,especially now that those two drop-dead hot men entered her life. I'm really looking forward to read the second book of this series, finding out what Xanders knows and if Adina will end up in a triangle relationship."}

{"text": "Had I just read the first 60 pages of this book I would have loved it. I thought the idea was new and refreshing for the age group it was targeted to. Then the last half of the book happened. Pages 61-200 were just alright and the last part was terrible. The author tries so hard to create these amazing eye-popping situations for the characters that it doesn't make any sense. Every situation is one step \"Crazier\" than the next with no real development. In fact some of the situations just came out of no where and didn't even really fit. \n The part that I really disliked was the whole situation of the author quickly glossing over everything at the end. After so much build up I felt it sold the readers short on the ending. \n Another thing I did not like was that some of the situations spent so much time being explained and then just disappeared. \n Overall, I would have loved to like this but it just.. fizzled out at the end and that made me sad."}

{"text": "\"Please be as you were. I will try to help you.\" She hesitated, and pulled out the handflower honey and added a little more to the mixture in her cup. The water was faintly gold against the silver cup; the small stones in the bottom shone like gems. She did not want god and silver and gems; she wanted ordinary things, commonplace things. Trees and birdsong and sunlight, and unfractured earth. \"Let the earth knit together againt, like - like darning a sock. Here are the threads to mend you with.\" And she threw a few drops from her cup into the trench. (p 24) \n Chalice is the most recent work of Robin McKinley, whose last novel, Dragonhaven (2007), fell short of what McKinley fans know she is able to do. Prior to Dragonhaven, McKinley had published Sunshine(2003), which won the Mythpoeic Fantasy Award for Adult Literature. Still, Sunshine, a vampire love story, was a departure from the sort of voice McKinley was wont to use. \n Chalice, at last, brings classic McKinley back to us. Woodwright and beekeeper Mirasol is chosen for a role in the governing Circle of her demesne: the role of Chalice, a position second in importance only to the Master. As young and uninitiated as she is, the new Master is more so: a Priest of elemental Fire. The two of them must learn to work together to pull the earthlines back into harmony after the previous Master's seven years of wanton, careless destruction. \n This, McKinley's 14th book, offers the same soothing sweetness as Mirasol's honey. McKinley's strengths are evident, if not at full force. Her characterizations are flawless, both engaging and subtle. Her sense of geography, the ability to create an unknown world and make it tangible to the reader, is unparalleled in fantasy writers. And while McKinley's characters battle evil, there's nothing simple about their understanding of it. There's little that's black and white, but much that ends up being rosy, or even honey-colored. \n If I had to describe her weakness in this book, it's too much telling (of the wrong sort - the sort of backstory narration common to the \"Once Upon a Time\" of a fairy tale) and not enough personal interaction. The Master speaks in paragraphs, and a large part of the first section of story is flashback. This writing style lends to the characterization of Mirasol herself as a loyal over-thinking introvert. \n Don't misunderstand me. This book is enchanting, full of the McKinley that I have long worshipped - erudite and lovely, a fairy tale as personal journey. It's well worth your time, particularly if you have ever loved Cecil/y or Lissar or Honor-as-Beauty. \n While there's not as much action as The Blue Sword or as much romance as Spindle's End, Chalice contains the sort of world where, it seems, even Luthe might feel comfortable, and certainly a world to which I hope McKinley takes us again."}

A fun read for me and I am moving on to book 2 immediately."}
{"text": "This provides an interesting world where Gods are created by our belief, but what happens when we stop believing or few people still believe in them. It had some graphical scenes in it and therefore should not be read by children, but overall it was an interesting story, if you are not easily offended. There is a bit from the author reflecting in both the beginning and a bit at the end that were also interesting. I'd probably read the sequel if/when it comes out, mostly out of curiosity to see what direction the story takes. The narrative was very well written and it invokes a wanderlust just by hearing the descriptions of small towns in America."}

He continues to set challenges in front of Alexa to either bind or break her. And Alexa is determined to stop him. She enlists the help of her most trusted friends, as surreptitiously as possible, but Zachariel is getting savvy. And Seth wants her dead. \n Faced with impossible choices, Alexa tries to game the system, and nearly succeeds. Shame that Moloch was most displeased. Alexa, shattered and barely able to withstand her handlers' actions, finds her greatest ally yet, and a new path through the conumdrum. \n Again, we are thrust through a story that just picks up momentum with each turn of the page. Cannot wait for the resolution! \n I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review."}

{"text": "This is the second book in a series, but enjoyable as a standalone. \n Aeron is a 29 year old, shy gay man living in a rural Welsh village and caring for his chronically ill mother. He has had few positive experiences of his life, but he counts his new job as a farmhand to be one of them. The stable work enables Aeron to save some money for his mother's care. She has multiple sclerosis and a rapidly declining prognosis. Aeron is determined to do a good job, but he's unprepared for his attraction for the big burly farm owner, Dylan Roberts. \n Dylan lost his husband, his shifter mate, two years ago when rogue vampires tore his pack to literal shreds. He harbors immense guilt, and lives only to avenge his mate. All Dylan's friends want him to come back to their packs, but he remains isolated, hoping to pull the vamps into a trap. Meeting Aeron is unexpectedly upsetting. He feels an immediate attraction for Aeron, which only frustrates him further. How could he even look at another man? His heartsblood was shed and he vowed to never love again. \n Aeron recognizes the need he observes in Dylan--he's so terrifyingly lonely, and Dylan seems the same. He convinces Dylan to have a friendly arrangement, hoping that it might escalate into something more. And, it does, but not in the way Aeron expects. He has no idea that Dylan is a wolf shifter, or that he's now under surveillance by ancient vampires. \n Meanwhile Dylan's inner wolf longs to be mated to Aeron--who is inconveniently human. Even if Dylan could confess his secrets to Aeron, it's impossible to believe the beautiful young mane will be willing to change in to a shifter adn leave his home behind. \n This was an interesting addition to the shifter genre. Dylan is a kind and conscientious man who fears the possibility of losing another mate. He'd rather shut himself away than try again, but Aeron is fiercer than he'd first seemed. I loved the interaction between Aeron and Dylan. Once the secret is revealed the tension only climbs. The addition of vampires creates a solid bit of drama, and Aeron's mother is also part of all equations. The canon of shifterdom is a little looser here, with less emphasis on the discomfort of shifting, and of turning humans to shifters. Dylan's alter ego, as a renown paranormal investigator--a force for justice as it seems--only bolsters Aeron's interest. \n The sexytimes are definitely yummy, and the story wraps with and HEA that includes all the affected parties. It was a well-paced interesting love story that had great side characters, likely ones who had big parts of the first book, and the door is open to another story in the future."}

A band of talented and dangerous misfits had completed an impossible mission in the first story. They returned to collect their reward. Instead they were betrayed and one of their crew was kidnapped. The remaining members, led by the intrepid Kaz Brekker, now have several new missions. The first priority is to reunite their gang. Then they must get the large payment that is still owed to them. And last, but definitely not least, wreak vengeance on the guilty. Leigh Bardugo is a masterful writer. Each character becomes so real that you can almost see them. The author slowly reveals the tormented secrets that motivate their behavior. Life has not been kind to the Six of Crows gang and they will not be kind in return. From reading the bio on this author, I see that Leigh Bardugo has Hollywood connections. I certainly hope that she can parlay them into a movie(s) deal. I would love to see her stories on the big screen and am looking forward to future books that are hopefully also set in this mesmerizing universe she has created."}

{"text": "I really liked this book as is evidenced by the four stars. It was gripping and kept you guessing to the end, and I will definitely read the sequel. \n That said, I felt a bit dizzy at the beginning trying to figure out the timeline of the story because the author throws much of the back story at readers up front, and does this by using a lot of \"before this happened, and after this happened\" sentences. I had to reread a few parts so that I wouldn't feel so disoriented. Once I got used to her writing style I did fine, thought. \n Believe it or not, even though I've read some reviews complaining about this, I like how the protagonist zeroed in on tassels in her narrative. The detail helped me stay in the story, well . . . until I read this part on page 262: \n \"What did any of it mean? Where could it go? He was a death deity. I was a senior in high school.\" \n At which point I broke out into uproarious laughter and my seven-year-old daughter came running to ask me what was so funny. Note to self for my own writing: don't ever EVER have one of your characters point out how ludicrous the premise of your book is. It breaks the magic. \n Fortunately, I was able to get into the story again pretty fast after that. My husband and I even had a good laugh about it."}

But the story becomes too choppy in part three because of all the events happening in other places, that the novel looses its tightness. While I love all the details coming together in building the bigger picture of the prequel story as a whole (I mean we even get the build up to the Clones via Syfo-Dias and see Dooku as a conflicted Jedi, how cool in setting the stage to make Episode II more believable) the book as a whole cannot receive my full 5-star appreciation.

Aczkolwiek po Magic Study zauwazylam jedna interesujaca rzecz, ale najpierw powinnam nakreslic pewne tlo dla moich spostrzezen. Wiekszosc dziel z jakimi mam do czynienia posiada bohaterki, ktore sa ksiezniczkami, ktorymi trzeba sie bezustannie zajmowac i je ratowac. Jesli kobieta jest samodzielna i niezalezna to zazwyczaj jest z nia cos nie tak z innej strony. Yelena jest dla mnie postacia szczegolna poniewaz w calym tym natloku postaci, z jakimi kiedykolwiek mialam do czynienia jest jedna z nielicznych, ktore zwyczajnie szanuje. Nie lubie i mysle, ze nie bylabym w stanie jej polubic. Ale szanuje ja i zycze jej wszystkiego najlepszego. Jest kobieta twarda, jest kobieta inteligentna, z charakterem i jest niezalezna. Na dodatek odwazna i momentami szalenie nieostrozna. Uwazam jednak, ze przy tym jest po prostu pelna wiary we wlasne sily. Either is fine by me. Bardzo przyjemnie bylo obserwowac taka bohaterke. W Magic Study jej notowania w moich oczach rosly z kazda chwila poza jednym aspektem (Leif). W Fire Study nie zrozumialam kilku zdaje sie kluczowych informacji wiec moja ocena jest nieco zafalszowana. Bardzo nie lubie nie rozumiec relacji miedzy ludzmi. Moge nie rozumiec fabuly, to zdarza sie dosc czesto ale nie jestem w stanie sie uspokoic wiedzac, ze cos mi zgrzyta w relacjach postaci. Jednakze sama postac Yeleny nadrabiala niedociagniecia. Dziewczyna w zasadzie od dziecinstwa byla zniewolona w taki czy iny sposob. Niewola przy boku Valka wypelnila puste w jej sercu. Mozna bylo mniemac, ze to milosc ja zmienila. A fige! Pierwszy raz od bardzo dawna zobaczylam dziewczyne, ktora BYLA odwazna, BYLA zdecydowana i BYLA samodzielna. Szalenie mi sie podobalo jak szybko przyzwyczajala sie do nowej sytuacji i od razu brala byka za rogi. Nawet majac w perspektywie smierc bez wzgledu na to co zrobi. Zawsze potrafila znalezc wyjscie z sytuacji. Ponadto ona naprawde byla czlowiekiem, ktorego kochaja klopoty (z Valkiem wlacznie). Ladowala sie zwykle nie tam gdzie trzeba, ale i tak glowna przyczyna problemow bylo to kim byla (czyli cos na co miala niewielki wplyw, ale nie siadala w kaciku placzac tylko parla do przodu). Przy czym dochodzimy tym samym do momentu w ktorym bede sie musiala poznecac nad fabula i ksiazka jako taka. Bardzo podobala mi sie prostota Poison Study, byla magia ale w malej dawce. Malej, znosnej dawce. W Magic Study Yelena pokazala caly swoj charakter wiec przez jakis czas ksiazka podobala mi sie bardziej od poprzedniczki. Jednakze potem kiedy magii zrobilo sie za duzo cos zaczelo mi przeszkadzac. W przeciagu dwoch lat w ksiazce caly swiat stanal na glowie, wszystko sie obracalo tylko dookola Yeleny i wszystko od niej zalezalo. Ja rozumiem, ze bohaterka powinna byc nietuzinkowa ale na bogow... Troche przedobrzyli! Zwlaszcza kiedy wszyscy zaczeli ja traktowac jak dowodce, ktorego nalezy sluchac. Rozumiem, ze Valek, Ari i Janco ja dobrze wyszkolili, to ma nawet sens. Z drugiej strony za duzo zalezalo od jej opartych na czystym szczesciu planow. Nie podobal mi sie tez Moon Man. Koncowka naprawde mnie bardzo niemilo zaskoczyla. Nagle swiatlosc niebieska ja oswiecila. Na dodatek Moon Man seemed to know. Pozwolil umrzec tylu osobom bo nie chcialo mu sie powiedziec jej czegos jasno? Nie zrozumialam tez czemu ona zaczela w pewnym momencie odpychac wszystkich. Nie zrozumialam tez nigdy jej realcji z Leifem. Byla drewniana. Ona mu za szybko wybaczyla. Zreszta na bogow, to on powinien ja przeprosic i blagac o wybaczenie za te idiotyzmy, ktore zrobil, a nie zachowywac sie jak fochnieta primadonna. Bardzo zdegustowal mnie tez watek polityczny. Jak sie dluzej zastanowilam to ona nie pojechala do Sitii z wlasnej nieprzymuszonej woli. Fajnie zobaczyc rodzine, ale ona nigdy Sitii nie traktowala jak domu. Nie rozumiem wiec tym bardziej focha, ze jest zdrajca bo chce wrocic do Valka... Ponadto po tym wszystkim co robila dla Sitian oni zmuszali ja do ciaglego udowadniania, ze warto jej ufac, bez sensu. Watek polityczny nieszczegolnie do mnie przemawial. Nie znam sie, moze dlatego. Wracajac do tego co w ksiazkach cenie najbardziej. Podobalo mi sie, ze postaci sa soba przez caly czas. Zmienialy sie pod wplywem tego co ich spotykalo, ale w glebi serducha pozostawaly soba. Choc najbardziej podobal mi sie watek romantyczny. Relacja Yeleny z Valiem jest naprawde szczegolna i piekna. Niesamowicie mnie zauroczyla maniera w jakiej on do niej mowil, dodajac niemal do kazdego zdania \"love\". To bylo naprawde cos pieknego i uwielbialam ich dialogi glownie z tego wzgledu. Abstrahujac od tego, ze oni zwyczajnie ze soba rozmawiali. Taka pare jestem w stanie sobie wyobrazic. Mozna bylo zauwazyc chemie pomiedzy nimi, widac bylo to ogromne uczucie. Jestem skrzywiona przez japonskie podejscie do tematu, ale brak dramy zwiazanej z watkiem romantycznym byl dla mnie ogromna ulga! Btw dotarlo wlasnie do mnie, ze przeinaczenie imion dwojki glownych bohaterow ujawnia wielka prawde o ich charakterach. Yelena faktycznie byla miejscami naiwna i zachowywala sie jak sploszona lania, tymczasem Valek jezdzil po wszystkich rowno. \n . \n Ghost, huh? Uwielbialam konskie dialogi, po prostu uwielbialam. Byly przepieknie skonstruowane. Lakoniczne i bardzo zwierzece. Nie zrobiono w ksiazce ze zwierzat ludzi tylko pozostawiono je zwierzetami. Jestem na to szczegolnie wrazliwa! Przytocze nawet jeden dialog pomiedzy Kiki i Yelena: \n . \n \"Kiki?\" I asked. \n \"Bad man. No one hurt Lavender Lady.\" \n \"Thanks.\" \n \"Peppermints?\" \n \"When we're done. And apples, too!\" \n . \n Dialogi z konmi byly jednymi z niewielu momentow, kiedy moglam sie posmiac. W Magic Study bylo tych momentow wiecej, ze wzgledu na Irys. Wszystkie sceny gdzie Yelena \"rozkazywala\" innym wykonac to czego nie byla w stanie doprowadzaly mnie do lez ze smiechu. Byly absolutnie cudowne. Szkoda, ze w Fire Study tego zabraklo. Niemniej konskie dialogi spokojnie nadrabialy niedociagniecia w tej dziedzinie. Plus ilosc scen Valek x Yelena satysfakcjonowala moja romantyczna dusze. \n . \n Generalnie caly cykl bardzo mi sie podobal. Zaczynalam od Darke Academy, ktore mi sie nie spodobalo, poprzez Guardians of Time, ktory to cykl spodobal mi sie na tyle, zeby za nim tesknic. Seria Study sprawila, ze jak w przypadku Straznikow nie bylam w stanie sie oderwac od lektury i zdecydowalam sie nawet na karkolomne czytanie przez chwile pdf zanim dorwalam wersje papierowa. Bohaterowie podobali mi sie znaczie bardziej niz w Straznikach, Yelena jest ciekawa i niestandardowa bohaterka jesli chodzi o moje osobiste doswiadczenia w tej materii. Watek romantyczny podobal mi sie w stopniu uragajacym moze nie wszelkim ale pewnym normom. Dzisiaj zaczelam czytac \"Priestess of the White\". Zobaczymy czy przebije w moim rankingu serie Study. W planach mam przeczytanie Power i Ice Study wiec istnieje szansa, ze cos o nich napisze ale niczego nie obiecuje. Cala serie Study bardzo polecam!"}
{"text": "The Swan Kingdom is a re-imagining of the fairy tale Six Swans. The first written account of this tale was done by the Brothers Grimm around 1812, and its variations throughout Europe feature ravens or ducks. Those early versions were meant to emphasize the unity of the family in light of adversity, which theme Marriott continues. \n In The Swan Kingdom, King and Queen of the Hartlands have four children: three boys, and the youngest, a girl, Princess Alexandra. Alexandra inherited her mother's skills as \"a cunning woman,\" a woman connected with the natural forces and wise in ways of natural healing. Not even her skills can save the Queen when a malevolent being seeks to destroy the Hartlands. Alexandra is sent away, her brothers are turned to swans, and it takes her a year before she even realizes that she's the only one who can save them. \n I understand why an agent and/or an editor took on this book. Marriott has incredible potential as a fantasy writer. Her descriptions, even of lowly herbs, are sumptuous. When she sets her mind to it, she can write a tight, fast-paced scene. Alexandra is (mostly) a smart, likeable protagonist, with the sincerity and doubts of youth but without posturing angst. If you're a fan of fairy tales at all, The Swan Kingdom is worth reading. \n However, I don't think that The Swan Kingdom will ever be heralded as her best work. (At least, I hope not.) It's filled with cliches, such as Alexandra thinking she's \"plain\" and the reader finding out later that she's beautiful. The pace can sometimes lag (I started skimming), and she overdevelops minor characters and under-develops major ones. This book is a great beginning, and I'm excited to see more from this promising author."}
{"text": "I have to say this was a really different book for me to read... but that's a good thing. I love different. There's a liveliness to this story that I found quite refreshing. I loved Fi, she was very feisty, protective, do-it-yourself (I can so relate) kind of person. I loved the chemistry and relationship between her and Flint - loved when he ribs her about her skills. There is always this feeling of threat. Fi and her brother are trying to find out what really happened to their parents - were they really killed? I have to say that Lumi's journey - whoa! She had it tough. \n It is quite an interesting read that will definitely keep your attention. There is a mystery of secrets, lies and deceit that slowly unfolds leading to the truth as to who is behind it all. I definitely recommend it. Good story that definitely leads into making me want to read book 2. Looking forward to it."}
{"text": "9th&up. Fashions itself after Twilight, but for a slightly older crowd (some mention of drugs, there's drinking and sex). It was an entertaining read- but be prepared for the cliffhanger ending."}
{"text": "Wow. What to say of a YA marketed as romance that is a massive epic of greatness? Funny, sweet and heartwrenching by turns, the quality of the writing lyrical without being over the top... READ THIS trilogy! I can't spoil you, but it's a genre given to gothic melodrama and this is that genre done WELL, maybe more of a feat than writing in a generally acceptable niche instead."}
{"text": "I really enjoyed this book as the next addition in the series of the Mist-Torn witch series. I love the characters and their varying adventures. Can't wait for book 4 to be released."}
{"text": "So good. \n Perhaps it's that my friend Carl has been talking about the movie Big Fish, but I felt that this novel was reminiscent of it for me. \n Micah's grandfather is dying, and his great-aunt Gertrudis is unable to be sympathetic. She in fact makes Micah's life miserable while the man he lives above all else is leaving him. \n But, there's the Circus Mirandus-a magical circus. This might be just what will help his grandfather. \n The relationship with his friend Jenny is sweet-it could have gone either way. \n I thoroughly enjoyed this read."}
{"text": "An undeniably poignant ending. I like authors that push my limits. I wasn't initially comfortable with the 'voice' I think you call it, of some characters. Then I started to feel a Cajun or Jamaican kind of rhythm to their speech and it was quite musical after a while. I also felt uncomfortable with the idea of 'certainty' around the ghost / soul destination, as if the living had control over the dead and where they end up, but it lent a tension throughout the story that kept me reading. Eventually I was caught up in the story and the relationship between Chess and Terrible, and Lex. The romance tension. I have to say I am interested enough to read the next in this series. I am a 'happy ending' reader, and I think this author has me reeled in for the next book. With 'Game of Thrones' I gave up for the unrelenting disappointment after the fourth book, I don't wish to find this here....."}
{"text": "I have always felt that there is something inherently sinister about marionettes: The fixed expressions with their gleaming, shallow eyes; Their jagged, spider-like movements; The hollow, clicking sounds that serve as harbingers of their physical intentions. To me, they have never seemed whimsical or childlike. Donohue capitalizes on that not uncommon reaction with an eerie yet lyrical tale of a woman who seeks escape from danger and drudgery and finds herself in a nightmare world that little by little feels like home, and the earnest husband who yearns to bring her back to his side even if the journey towards that end threatens to cost them both more than they can spare. Allegory, adventure, magic and menace combine in a unique take on an old myth. \n This ARC was obtained at BEA16, in exchange for an honest review."}
{"text": "I have one thing to say about Love Remains by Zrinka Jelic. WOW! What a fantastic read. I'm not even sure how to give a review because I don't want a spoil all the plots and twist that this story contains. What I can share is that this is one of those books I read straight through. \n Zrinka Jelic's wonderful hero and heroine, Olivia and Tom, were a delight to get to know. Olivia isn't a very lovable heroine in the beginning. Please give her a chance. She changes into a remarkable woman and I loved rooting for her very unusual happy-ever-after with Tom. \n From the moment I met Tom, he just sizzled off the page--totally hot, hunky-all male lawyer and dad. I just loved his character. When Olivia first meets Tom, I couldn't help asking how could she forget someone like him? No spoiler alerts from me. Zrinka Jelic does a great job explaining Olivia's behavior and it adds such great conflict to the story. \n I found Love Return's supernatural element very unique and refreshing. My one complaint is I would have loved to have a little more interaction between Olivia and her sister. Their relationship was essential to the story. If the sisters' relationship was strong on the page, then it would have made the supernatural element that much stronger. \n Overall, this is a wonderful story and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. I highly recommend Love Returns by Zrinka Jelic."}
{"text": "My husband and I listened to this book on a road trip and were both gravely disappointed. Apart from the superfluous foul language, the story is dull and unimaginative. Grossman borrows frameworks from the Harry Potter and Narnia books but fails in creating an \"edgy\" HP, an objective I perceived in the plot. The characters are unlikeable and self-pitying. Grossman tries to fit so much into one book that there's no real cohesion to the story. Perhaps it would have been a little better if the author had focused on just one of the many stories he tries to weave together. Regardless, this book was tedious, at times offensive, and hardly qualifies as mediocre."}

{"text": "Everneath was good, but I think it could have been better. In fairness, it may be that it only pales because I just read the amazing Crown of Midnight and that set the bar pretty high. \n What I liked: \n I've been seeing this book around for quite a while now so I was thrilled to find it at the library. It's quick and to the point which was nice, though I think it could have been a little longer. It's told through alternating time points: now and 6 months in the past. I really liked the way the two story arcs wove together, helping me to understand the choices and mistakes in the past that lead Nikki to her current predicament. It made her a sympathetic character. I liked her personality a lot, she never struck me as stupid or selfish or whiny. \n What I didn't like: \n I'm not sure if it was so much that I didn't like it, but I didn't really feel the romance and love between Nikki and Jack. He was sweet and a good guy, but this didn't feel like a go through hell and back to be together kind of love. \n My recommendation: \n Everneath is good and definitely worth the read and although it isn't one of my favorites, I'm glad I read it and will be reading the next one. Read it and see what you think=)"}
{"text": "I haven't read many paranormal romances, particularly those between different types of paranormals and was pleasantly surprised to find I liked this story. \n The author provides enough background information to give the characters and story depth. The information provided about the werewolf world and its traditions highlighted the sacrifices that Blacque was making for his pack. The story of how Bleu was turned was heartbreaking. The main characteres definitely had a spark, both physically and emotionally. \n The plot was interesting with a good blend of romance and action. Plus I always love an ending that includes public declarations of love! \n I wasn't too keen on the inclusion of information about the other types of paranormals who inhabited the town (which reminded me of Storybrooke from the TV Once Upon a Time as it was difficult to leave) as I didn't feel this added any real value to the story. \n Favourite line....\"He lay gazing at the other man's knees, wondering how God had managed to make such a mundane body part so completely beautiful on this man.\" \n All in all, an enjoyable read."}
{"text": "again, a book ive scanned past a million times because the cover just didn't draw me in.

Barton - would definitely recommend to everyone as a must read"}
{"text": "It took me over a month to finish this book because the long, rambling descriptions and narratives slowed the book down immensely. It's a shame that I have to give it only two stars, because I really wanted to like it. The story was interesting and the author really does write well. \n I enjoyed the story being told from Merlin's point of view and I enjoyed the dialogue. But it got bogged down far too often with going overboard on describing how the rain glistened on the blades of grass under an April sky... pages and pages of description. \n I will read the other two, and hopefully they will be better."}
{"text": "I need the next book...like now. I adore Alex Fierro; she is one of my favorite characters Riordan has ever written and her addition to this group is perfect and fantastic. While this adventures was whirl-windy and kind of lame, I still enjoyed the characters and their journeys. I enjoyed Amir and Sam's development. Also that cliffhanger is juicy and enticing! I am a shameless fan of Riordan's books and this book did not disappoint."}
{"text": "I wish I could rate this book more highly; I really do. The plot's intriguing and there are some really lovely passages. But there's also (very subtle) shifting points of view, jumps in logic and action that don't quite make sense, and characters that feel like they're playing a part, rather than being authentic. I'm looking forward to more by Leah Cypess."}

{"text": "3rd&up \n Angus Cairns is a brownie- no, not a delicious chocolatey dessert or a cookie-selling little girl, but an honest to goodness legendary creature from folklore who loves to clean, organize and tidy up- while making a bit of mischief on the side. Because of a curse that was put upon his family by the Queen of Shadows (ruler of the Enchanted Realm), he must travel from his homeland in Scotland to the wilds of America to serve young Alex Carhart- whether she wants it or not. \n Alex, 11 year old master of messiness, doesn't want a strange creature cleaning up after her- especially one with such an incredible temper, but when Angus and Alex discover that the tie between their families is wreaking havoc on her brother and father, they must work together to break the curse. If they're lucky, they might heal more than one family before they're done, and find a true friendship along the way. \n Coville, a children's literature master, has really outdone himself with his latest story- the first in a new series. Angus and Alex are well formed, with great voice and three dimensional personalities. The multi-format style of the story really adds to the tale- moving the story forward through diary entries, school assignments, mythical encyclopedia entries and more, including appealing illustrations that really bring the characters to life. \n This is a charming book from a talented author. \n This ARC was obtained at BEA15, in exchange for an honest review."}

{"text": "I'm only giving this four stars because the ending seemed so rushed. Otherwise great."}
{"text": "This concludes the Guardians trilogy. Perhaps I would have enjoyed the final book more if I hadn't had to wait for it. The story is quite convoluted and it was harder to care about the characters and their mission as time went by. There are three men and three women chasing three stars created by three goddesses while being pursued by the evil entity that wants to destroy all worlds. So, not too over the top. The men include a powerful magician, a traveler through time and space, and an immortal. The women consist of a seer, a mermaid, and a werewolf. The romance in this final book is between the immortal and the werewolf. Needless to say, a total suspension of disbelief will be required. It is obvious that someone did a lot of research into a lot of obscure topics to flesh out this story. But it really just seemed to be trying to hard. I didn't love Island of Glass."}

{"text": "I really enjoyed reading this short story. Written from a different perspective, it provided a lot of understanding as to who Zorin is and gave a chance to dig deeper into his mind. It allows the reader to identify with his pain and find out what drives his choices. It also gives us a better view of Varian's character and what makes him tick. A great add on story that develops the storyline and adds a bit of depth to some of the supporting characters."}
{"text": "Really good book.....Why did it have to end that way.:3"}
{"text": "This post-apocalyptic literary novel chronicles the life of several immortals, mostly Mathias and Dorian, in the centuries prior to and years immediately following The End of Days. It is told from an omniscient viewpoint, which personally is the most difficult for me to read. I am not a fan of head-hopping prose, and this story switched so quickly I struggled. Greatly. \n Also, the plot is decidedly alinear, and we jump through the centuries meeting and discarding acquaintances--some who reappear later to actually participate in the plot. However, it is never clear when these people will be important, so I had trouble connecting. \n Mathias is an immortal. He knows because his aging is severely slowed after adulthood, and also because he failed at suicide in the 1860's. The End has come in 2070, and Mathias is pretty jaded years later. He failed at foiling the Fiery Ones destruction of Europe's cosmopolitan world, and scrapes by doing odd mercenary work until he learns of Luca, a repainter who matches the description of Mathias' dead lover from 1984. Mathias contracts Dorian, a former lover (from the mid-nineteenth century) to bring Luca to his home. \n Turns out Luca the repainter is the reincarnation of Mathias's lost Luca, and they are reunited. Which, I liked. \n Dorian has a good bit of the plot as well. We learn of his time as an escort, and his failed loves. One such is Petra, who does return to him a century later, as she is also immortal. Dorian and Mathias are not particular friends in the story, despite both being immortal, however they come to an uneasy coexistence near the end. \n In the end, of the book not the world, the plot lines meander toward convergence. It seemed to me there were many crises that became resolved but no clear climax/resolution. And, it turns out that The End, of the world not the book, was orchestrated by seraphim. Oh, and Lucifer opposed this fiery destruction. Talk about Revelations.... \n This book wasn't my style of read. I had issues with the pacing and diction was a problem. I'm one of those sticklers for choosing the right word, and there are homophone hang-ups here. (Taught/taut, duel/dual among others...). \n Also, the story didn't so much resolve as it did end. I knew it would be this way with 100 pages to go, however. The way pacing was going I was sure I'd be unsatisfied with the resolution. Also, this being the first of a series, I knew more would need to happen in the second book. That being said, I'm not left with the \"must read sequel\" craze. \n All romantic portions of the prose were perfunctory in nature. I felt as though the relationships, such as they were, were solid and caring, but we rather skipped the passion... \n I received a free copy of this book via the Don't Buy My Love program at Goodreads in exchange for an honest review."}
{"text": "Diana Bishop is the last in a long line of witches. The daughter of a powerful witch and wizard who died when she was young, she has always resisted her power, preferring instead to live a human life. After becoming an historian, she is doing research when she calls up an old book, Ashmole 782. Immediately, she knows it is bewitched. After a cursory review, she sends it back to the stacks, wanting nothing more to do with it. Unfortunately, other witches are interested - as are Deamons and Vampires. One such Vampire is Matthew, who is very old, very charming and (not surprisingly) very good looking. Despite knowing that it is dangerous, Diana starts spending time with Matthew. As she does, her magic starts to assert itself. Together, they start to try and find out why and the secrets of Ashmole 782. At the same time, they need to protect Diana from the other creatures who all seem to want to get to her and her power. \n A Discovery of Witches is an enjoyable story but - unfortunately - somewhat predicatable. I felt I knew what was coming next almost from page one. The weak female protagonist who discovers she isn't so helpless after all, the mean, moody, broody vampire who has a heart. The fact that they fall in love despite the danger. An assortment of other non-human characters that aren't completely formed. As a fan of this genre of fiction, I had hoped for something more and just didn't get it. However, for those who don't read quite as many books involving vampires - or have missed the Twilight Saga, it is an good read."}
{"text": "A truly joyous, classic, adventuresome read for children and adults and everyone! If you don't like it, you have a heart of stone! I cannot recommend it highly enough to read and re-read. \n Book to Movie: The movie IS fabulous, a family favorite. However, if you can believe it, the book is even better! Makes a full of wonder family read aloud."}
{"text": "Seven Point Eight is an interesting read. Marie Harbon has crafted a story that not only explores the outer realms of what might be possible for human consciousness but also the complexities of human relationships. The Institute recruits people who are willing to test out of body experiences, time travel, remote viewing and projection of consciousness. The story is about the intertwined lives of the main characters Tahra, Paul, Max, Sam and Ava. Tahra and Paul are in a relationship and work together at the Institute. Tahra who has special powers has to travel to other dimensions to retrieve twelve other people who have become caught there and are unable to return without her help. It is almost too much for her. Max fearing she may turn her back on her gifts, uses his position as head of the program to manipulate her to do as he wants, to explore the possibilities of what her talents are. He blackmails her to stretch herself to see what she is capable of. This creates a lot of complications in her relationship with Paul and changes her future forever and that of Ava and Sam as well. This story takes you on a journey of many twists and turns. It poses some interesting concepts. I did not read book one but was given a summary so I'd have a better understanding of book two. I was given this book as part of Marie Harbon's Book Tour but the opinion is all mine. This author knows how to weave a good story."}

{"text": "When Purity Drake, an orphan and product of the Royal Breeding House, discovers she is next on the breeding list she has to escape. On the run a man saves her life. Turns out he is a slave and running from the Polar Barbarians with news that terrible forces now aim to enslave the Kingdom of Jackals. The unlikely duo team up in the hope for a better chance of survival in this fantasy/Steampunk world. \n Molly writes celestial fiction novels and is beginning to have strange visions from the Hexmachina. The stars are disappearing and a comet is heading back to Earth to take residence as a new moon - something is going on - and she needs to find Oliver Brookes for answers. \n For all its imaginative world building flair and well-written prose, I couldn't get into this book. For me there was just too much going on, too many fantastical worlds, place names and fractions of which I had the feeling I was not getting the full picture. Usually I love the bizarreness of Steampunk, and I did enjoy learning about some of his characters, especially Coppertracks, the super-intelligent steamman - a nano-mechanical lifeform. But, that wasn't enough. I guess I am the kind of person that needs to read the previous two books in this series to get a true feel of the past happenings of Purity's world. Although, it's clear now it's not going to pass as a standalone story, I do hope to check out the previous books and at a later date, come back better equipped."}
{"text": "Okay, see, this is good. This is a ridiculous crack premise which (a) takes itself seriously enough to think through some consequences while at the same time (b) remembering what it is here for, namely having proper young ladies whacking at zombies with swords. \n I wish it had found some way of dealing more with the raging Orientalism of the first book (which was by a different author, interestingly), but I suppose that's a huge lump of racism to get around. This book avoided the worst of it, thankfully."}

Oh, yes, the sky is a favorite place--or maybe a space ship. And, yes, there are sacrificial maidens. \n Now for my favorites: \"Changeling\" (nice combination...), \"Dot's Lunch\" (didn't see that coming), \"Mr. Long's School for Girls,\" and \"Bessie Returns.\""}

{"text": "In this second Slayer book, Joss McMillan is summoned to New York to help hunt down a rogue vampire blatantly consuming humans. While there, his secret is revealed: he had taken a private job--something taboo in the Slayer Society. \n See, this book inserts with the Vladimir Tod Chronicles. Joss had just spent the school year in Bathory living with his cousin Henry, and becoming best friends with Vlad--that is until he learns Vlad is a vampire. Joss stabbed him with his stake, but had not actually killed him. For this indiscretion, Joss is under probation. The Slayer Society has stayed his execution until his loyalty can be proved. The only way to prove his devotion to the SS is to eliminate the rogue vampire terrorizing New York. \n So, at age 15, Joss is the head of his own Slayer clan--even having some power over his uncle, Abraham. With the help of his team, Joss and Co. track the many vampires in the city. Joss is responsible for isolating Em, the teenaged-appearing eldest of the New York coven. While in pursuit, Joss unwittingly enters the V Cafe--a vampire hangout. The barista divulges too much info to him--and then gives him more when he recognizes that Joss will likely hurt his friend less than Em and the Vampire Council will. \n With a name and a location, Joss sets off to confront Boris--alone--as this is how his uncle seems to insist he act. It soon becomes clear that Boris is not acting alone--that, in fact, it was a brotherhood of four rogue vamps. \n Joss accepts yet another favor from Dorian, the strange person who had given him his great-grandfather's stake. In the course of this book Joss learns that Dorian is a powerful vampire--and someone he is destined to kill. What he hadn't expected to learn was that some vamps--like Vlad, and Sirus and maybe even Dorian--are not the heartless creatures he believed them to be. His regret for killing Sirus is only compounded by the menacing texts he continues to receive from Kat, Sirus' daughter. \n In the end, Joss' life is no longer forfeit--but he's got both Em and Kat on his trail. And, if he's honest, Joss is wondering if there is any way he can patch up his relationships with both Henry and Vlad. \n This book is a direct and complimentary read to the CoVT. It fills in the gaps nicely and sets the stage for Joss and Vlad to reunite, as well as fostering their coordination in later Tod books. For kids who enjoy Vlad's books, I think they will find the Slayer books just as enjoyable. Joss is a killer, sure, but he is entirely sympathetic. His need for vengeance springs from witnessing his sister's death by vampire-bite, and he is continually tormented by nightmares in which Cecile returns as a vampire. He is otherwise a societal outcast--and only receives any validation when he is within the Slayer society--and even that is hard won."}

{"text": "See full review for Unforgiven at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n Luce and Daniel have gone off into the sunset, living their happily ever after. But one of their friends isn't so happy. Cam's whole existence was changed because of the Luce/Daniel love story. In one of the many times that the couple fell in love, Cam met a girl named Lilith who changed his whole world. He was going to marry her. Until she wanted to get married in a temple - and he couldn't do it without burning the building down. Not wanting to tell her the reason why he can't get married in a temple, he broke things off with her; breaking his heart and hers in the process. He never knew what happened to her after he denied her, but he's about to find out. \n It starts with a song - Lilith's song - and a little help from Arrianne who tells him that Lilith ended up in hell. Cam goes out in search of Lucifer, but he doesn't have to look far. Lucifer knows what he wants, so he shows Cam what he wants to see. But Cam isn't satisfied with just a glimpse of her, especially because she is in Hell. So he makes a deal with the devil. If Lilith can fall in love with him again in fifteen days, then she goes free. If he can't, he has to stay by Lucifer's side for all eternity. Let the games begin... \n You know I hate the timing of the release of this book. If this book had come out after Fallen had, I probably would have been really excited to read it because CAM. Out of all the fallen angels, he was my favorite. But, since this book came out after the events of Rapture, I wasn't all that excited to read it. I would rather have known what happened with Luce and Daniel and their attempt to fall in love for the umpteenth time, only this time with no memories of past lives. But alas... \n Anyway, this story is okay. It's very bleak - obviously because of Hell - and the odds seemed to be stacked up against Cam."}
{"text": "Shadow's Lure is the second book of Sprunk's Shadow Saga, following the debut of \"Shadow's Son\" last year (2010). In this volume, we return to Othir immediately after the events of \"Shadow's Son\" as Caim heads north, looking for answers to his past and the murder of his parents. What he finds is a land under the grip of the Shadow, personified in the witch Sybelle and the hints of shadow born magic that darken the land. Meanwhile, Josey, as Empress, is struggling with the politics of a land that seems beset with chaos, not to mention assassins out to remove her. And then there's the fae Kit, who early in the book is whisked away from Caim as she has to deal with her own troubles. \n \"Shadow's Lure\" needs to be read in sequence with the rest of the series, unfortunately. Sprunk gives the new reader nothing to identify with with the characters, plunging the reader into a world where the three main characters have very little direct interaction with one another. readers coming to this book directly from the end of book one, though, will appreciate that this book picks up within days of the first book. \n Sprunk keeps the secrets of his world at bay, giving us only hints and suggestions. For now, this is enough, though the third book, \"Shadow's Master,\" has a lot of promises to deliver on. Sprunk's books will appeal to the sword and sorcery fans - assassins, magic, and action litter the novel, leaving very little room for the doldrums to creep in."}
{"text": "Many years ago, I imagined a world in which a woman was forced to marry a man she hated, confronting her own faith and prejudices along the way. Never content to leave my characters alone for very long, I took the same characters and their plight and placed them in France during the reign of Napoleon. Elspeth is caught between her intense devotion to her faith and her desire to survive, when she is torn from a nunnery and forced to attend an assassin's school. Throughout her adventures, she must confront her own demons and those of her future husband, unlock the secrets contained within the dark and terrible walls, unravel the mystery surrounding a spirit that continues to appeal for her assistance, and even walk through the afterlife in an attempt to assist another in their search for redemption. \n For me, this book was a labor of love, but also one full of doubt, because it is in many ways darker than my earlier books, and raw in its evil. Here, we have far greater forces of darkness than I have toyed with before - a ruthless murderer of ghosts and men in its anti-hero, a heroine threatened in every way possible by her new circumstances - her virtue, her faith, and her life is put on the line. It casts a different light on a character present in my other books, so much so that you may not recognize him at first. Mostly, it forced me to realize that I like setting myself impossible tasks, and asking such terribly powerful questions as - what would matter to a heroine more, her virtue ... or preventing another from sinning? \n Love is not love, if it does not care for another entirely unworthy of that love, more than it cares for itself..."}
{"text": "Katherine Arden's interest in Russian culture and literature and her talent with setting and story shine through in The Bear and the Nightingale, a gift for readers who have a weakness for folklore with a little edge and a lot of depth. \n In a remote area of northern Russia there lies a small village that has always been prosperous and protected by their belief in and respect for magic, spirits, and things unseen. Lately, though, the modern world has begun to seduce them away from their long held traditions and as they lose connection with the old ways, evil and misfortune starts to take hold. Luckily, young Vasilisa is determined to save her people. She believes in the old ways and will protect her village from evil spirits and dark forces- even while those she seeks to protect reject her because they fear what she represents and the ancient powers she fights against. \n This vivid, magical tale is highly recommended for fantasy lovers, historians, and anyone who would like a well crafted, engaging story to keep them company through a cold winter night. \n Thank you to Del Rey and Random House for providing this ARC in exchange for an honest review."}

An allegory indeed - and neatly presented through the story line. I enjoyed it very much - it was, for me, a really pleasurable blend of the nostalgia of my childhood Arabian Nights memories with the deliberate pause-to-think of the present-day world. The book might have been written in the 90s, but quite pertinent today too. Through the eyes of a story-teller's young son, Haroun, the story-line easily navigates the various trials of socio-political sufferage, always under the fantasy-veil of make-believe and fiction.

It is very literary with the mentions of books and the Great Library of Alexandria - which to be honest, I never really knew about before I read this book - and the storyline is quite complex. There were a few times where I seriously considered giving up on this book, but I pushed through somehow. Jess is a strange narrator because he's not necessarily good, but he's not necessarily bad either. Because of his upbringing in the world of book smuggling he's used to doing backhanded things to help his family, but that doesn't mean that he enjoys them. In fact, when his father puts him forward to be a spy in the Library, Jess is very reluctant to do so. He wants to be a Librarian. But he doesn't want to be a spy for his family.

But first, she must win a competiton against other assassins, thiefs and soldiers. \n I liked this book, but didn't love it. To me, it reminded me too much of Poison Study but without some of the things that I loved about it. Celaena is too childish and can't control her emotions. You would expect of the greatest assassin to be mature and in control, specially after all she's been through. And I don't mind that she likes dresses, I also like them. You can be a badass and also like superfluous things. But with all that was going on, it felt like she was just superficial. \n Also, I didn't like her attitud of keeping all to herself, not because she doesn't trust them but because she's protecting them. \n I didn't care for the love triangle, and I definitively think that the male characters were pointless. They were the type of character that usually girls are, just pretty things that help to move along the plot.

{"text": "Elemental Secrets by Elle Middaugh \n A book review by Kathleen S. Schmitt \n If one likes fantasy and magic and exciting plots, forge ahead. You will be rewarded with plenty of action and suspense. \n At a superficial level, Elemental Secrets is a teen fantasy book that is well-written and fully entertaining, although I found the pace a little slow in the first third of the book. Until the arrival of a magic action, I could not tell if this was anything but a teen romance novel. However, the appearance of magic in a rather sweet way hinted that the story was going to take some turns that would be intriguing. \n So, on with the plot. Protagonist Valerie appears as a reticent loner (due to changing schools so often as a military brat), but decides this time she is going to turn into an extravert. Furthermore, she finds the will and the energy to make this metamorphosis, which, in the first part of the book feels utterly contrived by the author. Valerie not only wins friends, she spirits herself at speed into the most popular group in the school where she finds ready acceptance. Okay. Nice. The reader who has experienced this kind of social interaction may enjoy this interplay. Readers who aspired to such status but did not attain it might find some of their vicarious needs being met through Valerie's transformation. But readers who have lived differently through high school, meaning most of us, just might be somewhat put off. For a start, I am often suspicious of a beautiful protagonist. But wait. The author has a reason for this leap that feels, well, unreal. \n Unfortunately, for me to explain much more would turn this review into one big spoiler. How to communicate what's in store is difficult without just saying what happens. However, I will try. If one likes fantasy and magic and exciting plots, forge ahead. You will be rewarded with plenty of action and suspense. \n If you are of a philosophical bent, think Nietzsche. What? You say. Well, around the first part of the Twentieth Century, a lot of writers and thinkers were pondering Nietzsche's philosophy. In American literature, this interest moved into what was called 'literary naturalism.' George Bernard Shaw wrote a play entitled \"Man and Superman\" based not only on the Don Juan legend but delving into the naturalistic myths of ancient deities (Think Venus and Zeus and other mythical gods). If you find the superhero enticing, or even if you are newly into Wonder Woman, read Elemental Secrets. \n Also, if you teach high school literature classes, you might want to check out this book as a possible choice for students to read when studying early Twentieth Century English/American literature. \n An internet contributor pointed to an interesting site: https://superheronovels.com/, stating that this old comic book genre may be the new genre in prose literature. You may wonder what I'm talking about, since I haven't told you the plot. However, if any of this rambling tickles your curiosity, then read Elemental Secrets. \n This first-in-a-series novel performs on various levels. While we will not find clarity in this first story, a whole series is emerging through which we can trust we will come to understand this different perception of the world - and perhaps the mind of the author. Is Elle Middaugh just writing a teen fantasy? Or is there something deeper here? Something that is profoundly political for our day and rolling out a scenario for world destiny? \n Thoughts about a master race arise, evoking shades of mid-Twentieth Century fascism. Demigods - kindly or malevolent? Human suppression or empowerment? Alarming suppositions about global warming...? This book offers much fodder for thought, a definite plus in my mind. Read intelligently, and you will find Elemental Secrets involving and rewarding."}

In Hexed (coming June 2014 from Delacorte Press) I got the fix I didn't know I needed-with a supernatural element to boot! \n Indigo is a cheerleader with football playing boyfriend whose biggest problems are her quirky, occult-shop-owning mother and on-again-off-again best friend Bianca. But her problems are about to get bigger: when an ancient book goes missing from her mother's store and a leather-jacket wearing bad-boy named Bishop shows up and tells Indie she's a witch, our cheerleader is swept up in a centuries-old fight between sorcerers and witches. \n This story is carried by Indie's refreshingly spot-on voice. Author Michelle Krys nails Indie's simultaneous frustration with the high school scene and longing to be a part of it, her flawed friendships with cheerleading captain Bianca and next-door-nerd Paige, as well as the complicated love/embarrassment she has for/over her mother.

{"text": "First of all, I just want to praise Jennifer for an another amazing work again. This is a well-done stand alone. I have to say she really has a talent for keeping things light and entertaining so that the readers wont come close to getting bored or anything. \n Secondly, I loved the fact that the Hero in this book is an Arum. At least we have more knowledge about them now. Turns out that they weren't as evil as the galactic glowworms (as Hunter calls them), err, Luxens perceived them to be. As Serena had said: \n \"...there was no such thing as white and black. There was a lot of gray in the middle.\" \n So that line pretty much sums up the whole Arum/Luxen fiasco. \n As much as I like this book, I still have some issues with it. Number one is that, I feel like Hunter and Serena are just an older and much more R-rated version of Daemon and Kat. The former's personalities don't differ much with the latter's. Which is such a shame. Also I think Serena didn't mourn over her friend's (her bestfriend since ever) death. Sure she did cry at the beginning, and sure she wants justice for Mell's death but in the middle of it all, all she can think of is Hunter's muscles and her death - but maybe it has something to do with the fact that she's being hunted down..? That must be it. And lastly, is that Serena seem to have no life before all the craziness began. Like, doesn't anyone even misses her? Even one person? Once she got sucked into all the alien mumbo jumbos, she just abandoned (unwillingly or not, it doesn't matter) her old life. It's a bit unsettling \n DAEMON WAS HERE!!!

I like the concept but sometimes the dialogue grates me but I can see why YA readers like it. Myself, I like the concept of shadow hunters - other than that, there really isn't anything in these books which is truly unique. And I love that there is a huge element of risk in the Clary (hate the name, I change it to Clarissa when reading, it sounds.... childish) and Jace's (equally dislike the name but Jonathan doesn't suit him) relationship - that takes balls. But it isn't as grim as it might be perceived - it is actually very sympathetically explored - although the kiss in the Seelie Court could have been toned down somewhat and I'm fascinated to see how far it goes. The story is reminding me of the Secret Circle very much. Bit of a shame Simon had to vampify - I liked the idea of keeping someone mundane/human in Clarissa's life. Vampires are always cool, but it over-complicates a love triangle (or at the end of the book, a non-love triangle - Jace and Simon got more action than anyone - together - a new ship?)which was fascinating to start with. Also, why are some of the characters - eg Alec & Isabelle not openly bothered about the incest? They have their own relationship interests with Magnus and the weird fae guy respectively but in the grand scheme of things they are darn normal relationships. Anyway, at some point I'll read the next one but I can't say I'd be too devastated if I didn't."}

I can't help thinking that the first two books should have been combined into one and that this would be the second of a trilogy. \n It has one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever read in any book with Alex and Aiden which is just - beautiful. And for me, that's saying something, I don't do soppy. But it is perfect, for the story and the characters and probably something that makes the ending and probably the next book all the more poignant. \n I actually highlighted some passages in this, mostly Leon centric, I loved the character and had kind of guessed the story arc there. Bringing the Greek gods into the book was a stroke of genius, more from that please. I'd like a big fight with the Greek and Roman Gods too while we are at it. But that's off topic. I can't help thinking it was a little too easy to smite the furies and get the better of Hades - surely Hades should be kick-ass? \n What ruins the book for me is the Seth/Alex relationship, which I think will put me into a minority. Don't get me wrong, I like the bad boys, I like them very much, but this relationship seemed wrong on so many levels - the elixir event is unforgivable - I agree with Aiden on that. I was actually quite disturbed that Armentrout was happy to go along these lines and have Alex react the way she does - to suggest that this sort of behaviour is acceptable is awful. For a young adult novel especially, its not in anyway okay. However tormented Seth is, I can't see how Alex can forgive or end up with him in the end. Clearly, their fusing at the end is going to to create this new relationship, which is fine, it will be interesting to see everybody else's reaction, but the only way Seth can come back from any of this is sacrificing himself or if Alex does kill him - they clearly can't both live. \n I really hope that this doesn't end like I fear it might. And its that fear that stops me giving it the 4 star, even though at times, it is a 5 star read."}

{"text": "DISCLAIMER: I received Dance of Shadows as a publisher ARC through NetGalley in exchange for my honest review. \n This review can also be found at The Title Page \n Rating: 1 Star \n I cannot say I enjoyed Dance of Shadows. \n The immature dialogue, the unimpressive world building, the annoying teenage attitude, the overbearing parental figures, and the lack of character depth added together makes me wonder how this ever got a publisher's attention. Not to mention the secret-but-not-really-a-secret we've got going on. At 1% into it, I dreaded reading the rest of this novel. \n I am completely unimpressed with this novel. \n Here is what I have put together: \n 1. The book has all of the standard crap that makes a crappy high-school novel crappy; \n -twin-like friends \n -roommate best friend \n -super obviously gay guy friend \n -super hot popular guy who's into main character \n -super evil popular bitch who is dating said popular guy \n -the black friend \n -the girly friend \n -the tomboy friend \n -the hot teacher \n 2. The book is riddled with inconsistencies. In just the first quarter of the book, I have a list of stupid little things that just didn't make sense. It makes the scenes that much harder to imagine, like the author didn't really care about what she was writing. \n Example: At 18% Steffie is said to have chain earrings. At 21% Steffie 'turned one of her hoop earrings absentmindedly'. Same setting, same scene, not time to change her earings. (Also, why is the author so obsessed with Steffie's earrings?) \n 3. The book is bogged down with useless crap that no reader cares about. I don't care if Steffie reaches up to touch her earring, I don't CARE if TJ adjusted the strap of her high heeled sandal as she climbed the stairs, I DON'T CARE IF BLAINE BUMPED INTO AN EMPTY SEAT! \n It feels like it is wasting my time. \n 4. The POV is confusing and irritating. It's hard to remember it's a 3rd person perspective when reading through it, you get confused as to who Vanessa is when you feel like it should be 1st person. \n I gave it a shot, but it just wasn't an enjoyable book to me."}
{"text": "See full review for Eternal Kiss of Darkness at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n If you've read the other Night Huntress novels you already know whom Mencheres - Bones' grandsire and co-ruler of their vampire line - is. Sometime after he killed his wife Petra, the old vampire was hanging out in Chicago but he wasn't doing anything good. After he killed his wife the visions that he has relied on have stopped, except for one. In this vision all he sees is darkness and he assumes that this darkness is his pending demise. Not wanting to delay the inevitable he searches out some ghouls and foolishly engages them in battle. But he doesn't fight back and thinks that this is the end... \n But it isn't. A suspicious passer by comes into the warehouse where the ghouls are keeping him and tries to interfere. Of course, a regular human with a gun against the ghouls is never going to end well. Mencheres not wanting to be responsible for an innocent human's death - especially one who came to his rescue - attacks the ghouls. But the human - Kira - sees what he is and passes out from not only the shock but her injury too. \n When she wakes up, she's in Mencheres's house completely healed. He tries to wipe her mind of the events, but it doesn't work. He thinks it's because of his blood in her system and decides to keep her prisoner for a few days before he tries again. But when he does, it still doesn't work. Somewhere along the way he has started to get to know Kira and has some intense feelings for her, feelings he hasn't felt since his wife. Beauty and the Beast anyone? Despite his better judgment he lets Kira go with her word that she won't breathe a word of what he is and the existence of the vampires to anyone. But he isn't the only one who has had some intense feelings, and as Kira looks for Mencheres again, she stumbles into something that she may never come back from."}
{"text": "How? How can you fill soooo many pages without anything actually happening plotwise? The upside is that if listening to the audiobook, I do not have to have a bad conscience if i fall asleep and wake up 20 minutes later, i just can continue listening to the story without bigger problems... \n ... a bit of an anticlimax after the first two books. But I just realized that there will be a fourth book. Maybe the writer should have stuck to the initial three-book-plan. :-{"}
{"text": "David Evans is a nothing-special kind of guy who loves his dear aunt-the woman who raised him-and works as hard as he can to support her, especially as she is ill. Trouble is, though he's a fantastic assistant and office keeper, he can't seem to keep a position. He's been doing off-site transcription, but it doesn't pay all the bills, so he takes advantage of the one opportunity he's given: temp work for Dr. Alun Kendrick. David heard Dr. Kendrick's voice once, for a transcription, but it did seriously naughty things for David. He can't wait to meet the man in person! \n Alun Kendrick is a cursed Fae. Years ago his lover, a type of rare healing Fae, was murdered and he's never forgiven himself. His punishment for not being there to save his beloved is a horrifying facial disfigurement that startles nearly everyone. Still, he works a a counselor to supernatural beings who find his grotesque appearance to be disarming enough to allow themselves to be vulnerable and accepting of treatment. \n Alun isn't prepared for his temp assistant to be human, and he's outraged that the placement agency sent David, despite him being a sunny, beautiful, thoughtful young man and conscientious employee. Alun tries to find fault in David's colorful adjustments to his office and solicitous treatment of his clients, but David's seeming missteps actually result in inadvertent breakthroughs for several of the supers that come in for counseling. And, Alun's not been tempted to find sexual pleasure since his last lover was killed, nearly two hundred years before. That David turns his crank to eleven? It cripples Alun. \n Unfortunately, there's unrest in the Fae realm and David's help is needed to assist Alun to return and set things to rights-and that brings on a whole new series of problems. David, unknown even to himself, is harboring a secret of his true self and this results in worsening of the conflict. Not to mention David becoming a target for the worst elements of the Fae. \n There's really a lot going on here, and I'm only scratching the surface plot lines. It's a sweet and engaging story with a tender romance that is born from David's ability to see Alun's true heart beneath the layers of emotional armor and his gruff and misshapen exterior. There's the tiniest bit of heat, and a slow burn to reach it, but that was fine. I really enjoyed the mismatch of characters, and how David makes himself indispensable to Alun, and his clients. David's got such a lovely and cheerful way about him, and yet he's not a pushover. He stands up for so many people, and rolls with the waves of supernatural lore that he finds himself swimming within. There's lots of comedic elements, and the pace was fantastic. I never felt like I was getting bored, because I constantly wondered: what's coming next? From helping vampires survive their blood aversion, to teaching young dragons to hoard, David's patient and caring attitude wins over everyone, including Alun, in time. Fun fact: Alun's one of three brothers, and it looks like the other two will have their own love-story books in this new series. I'm looking forward to reading on! I received a review copy via NetGalley."}

{"text": "Cyril and Linden are the perfect match for each other. I have laughed my butt off, I have melted into a big puddle on the floor, and I have most definitely swooned until near fainting while reading this book LOL! \n What I love the most about this book, is that Renea has created a refreshing, paranormal world unlike any I have ever read. Our alpha-hero in this story is one big, bad, mysterious, God-like man with an assortment of abilities and a paranormal-race unlike anything you may have witnessed. I think you may wish to read the book yourself to discover just exactly who he is rather than hearing my spill the beans--oh trust me, the sex appeal of this man is worth it! \n Our hero comes to a symphony where he meets our heroine, Linden, who is raising money--and this is where the suspense starts to take a hold on you! Linden is positive she knows this man. How could she not remember a face like that, his voice, everything about him that she fell in love with years ago; but he claims to have no recollection of their past though it feels familiar--and he absolutely has his suspicions in what role she plays in his life. He is eager to unravel the mystery and will do whatever it takes to find her place in his heart. \n After a series of twists and turns and eluding many moments of danger, everything falls into place and it will be a beautiful, yet, bitter-sweet experience. Linden and Cyril's relationship together, is a certain and entertaining symphony, indeed. \n I would love to tell you ladies to back off and leave Cyril for me, and me only LOL but this is seriously a book that I feel the need to share and recommend. HIGLY recommend for all you paranormal lovers out there. I wanna hear what you guys think about Cyril when you find out just who and what he is! I love it!! I'll be putting this up on the blog shortly!"}
{"text": "A much longer review to come, but I really enjoyed this book. It isn't perfect, but I think it was a bit refreshing to see a YA author take a chance with something that is a bit 'unique'. There is certainly room for it to be controversial given the Middle East culture/setting, but in a genre that is overrun with carbon copy books of each other this was refreshing. \n There were some parts that were predictable - it wasn't outright surprising that certain things happened, but it was just unique enough to keep me reading and not want to stop."}
{"text": "WHY DID I NOT READ THIS SOONER? \n I have so many questions. SO. MANY. I flew through this book so quickly and I was so engrossed that I didn't even feel the hours fly by. I was so confused and intrigued throughout in the best way possible. The plot is not like anything I've ever read before, the characters, well, I loved them, and I want to pick up the next book as soon as possible (which may be right now even if it is currently 1AM) just to find out what happens. \n PS: Noah may be kinda sorta possibly competing with my favorite bad boy Daemon from the Lux series right now...maybe. \n PPS: I may actually film a review for this. I have so much to say I can't even -- I don't even know."}
{"text": "I couldn't put this book down! This book was way better then Empress was. Not that I didn't like Hekat but I feel in love with everyone in this book. \n I really love the way that Karen Miller has a grasp of how to develope characters in a setting without making them appear to be boring, one sided and dull. \n Every chapter left me on my seat wanting more. I can't wait to read Hammer of God! \n The downside of the book, would have to be it did feel a little too long. Maybe a few pages shorter (50 pages or so) and it would be the perfect lenght."}
{"text": "Actual Rating: 4.5 \n So.... First off, I want to say that this book is unique despite what many people are saying. Sure, it sort of has somewhat similar aspects to other books, but this book/series is in no way a copy or inspired by any other series. Seriously, there can only be so many series out without some \"sort of\" overlap with the world building. So, for those scared to read it because you're afraid it'll just be a repeat of something you've enjoyed, don't be. This book stands well on it's own.... Anyways, I really enjoyed this book, but I do have to say that there was something that I can't explain that prevented me from being over the top like FIVE STARS! FIVE STARS! YASSSS!! The story was fast paced, and the world building didn't completely overtake the book, which I appreciate since first books often do that. I really like what the book has going for it.. a sort of modern/post-apocalyptic (almost) fantasy-esque setting and the class division between the Red and Silver bloods. Also, I like how there are classes of powers as well. As for the romance aspect of this book, I do have to say I was confused on who I wanted to root for for a period of time.. but that's just because there seemed to be a love.. square? But you'll see what I'm talking about when you read it... but yeah, this book was definitely more action, than romance, which I was really digging since I was on a contemporary YA/NA kick for a while. All in all, I can't wait to continue this series. GAH. When's the next book coming out again? Also... I KNEW that was going to happen in the epilogue. OH yeah."}
{"text": "See full review for The Dark Days Pact at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n So, in my review for book one of this series, I said that I wasn't sure if I was going to read book 2 because I wasn't all that intrigued as I thought I was going to be. When I realized The Dark Days Pact was coming out, I decided to add it to my reading list anyway because I had already read the first book, maybe book 2 would take me by surprise. And the crazy thing is, it did. Now that Lady Helen was free from her overbearing uncle's house and she was officially sworn into the Dark Days Club, things are less aggravating. Carlston is slightly more open with her about matters pretaining to the Club and other than Lady Margaret - Mr. Hammond's sister - no one is really telling Helen what she cannot do."}
{"text": "A part of me really wanted to like this book. The idea of my favorite Bennett sisters kicking zombie read end just appealed to the darker side of me. I loved the book preview and hoped the book would live up to the expectation. I was very disappointed. I tried. Believe me I tried, but I could not find the witty entertainment I expected to find. The gore was there. I expected it, but that was as far as the book came to the title. Perhaps I shall give it a second turn in a few years. Who knows. For now, it will remain hidden on the back part of my bookshelf."}
{"text": "An interesting story in which the battle of good and evil is fought against the backdrop of Egypt's ancient monuments. \n I really enjoyed the story. Stewart makes an intricate mix of religion, myth and history with fantasy and magical elements, and I thought it worked quite well. I like the way in which he uses theory about religion and myth to complement the story. \n The story is fast-paced and well written. I very much liked the characters and how they develop, choosing different sides in the course of the novel. The connections between the different characters and groups are sometimes complex, but this also means that the story stays interesting until the end, and makes it much more intriguing than a simple 'good vs. bad' type of story. \n I'm looking forward to reading more of the author's work."}
{"text": "2.5 \n I actually kind of liked this book. Well, most of the time. This was the kind of book that every twenty pages or so I changed my mind. Flip. Flop. Flip. \n I agree with most of the issues people had with it, but somehow it still managed to be entertaining and original. Honestly, I think most of the reason I enjoyed it so much was because of my love of Norse mythology. If I wasn't familiar with it, I think I'd have been pretty lost. \n The Monstrous Child is about Hel, the teenage daughter of Loki, sister to Fenrir and Jormungandr. Her family isn't exactly the tender loving type and that creates an angry, spiteful Hel. Odin banishes her to the underworld to rule there for all time. That's pretty much it. The rest is about Hel's time as queen of the underworld, her dreams of escape, and her obsession with Baldr. This isn't exactly a plot-driven book, but it was still quite entertaining. \n It was easy to dislike Hel. She didn't have much going for her. She was whiny and incredibly adept at self-sabotage. Some part of her ached for kindness and affection yet she spent all of her time alienating everyone and enjoying it. This didn't really bother me, though. If you consider the results of Hel's upbringing in the same way you would if she were human, it would make sense that she turn out a bitter, angry, hateful, teenage girl bent on vengeance. So while it's easy to understand the reasons for her awfulness, she was still awful. \n It was certainly a risk to make Hel's inner monologue so modern. It took me a long time to get used to it and even longer to move past how annoying it was. I suppose it was meant to make Hel easier for a younger audience to relate to, but instead, it came off as trying too hard. The only thing it was missing was \"lol\". It just didn't work for me. \n It was a fascinating and unique book, but overall, I don't think it was executed well enough to actually recommend. \n *I received an ARC in exchange for a fair and honest review."}
{"text": "Entertaining enough. Definitely didn't like it as much as the other series. Maybe just b/c I'm not as familiar with Egyptians gods as I am with the Greek ones."}
{"text": "Conquering the Dark is a fitting end to the trilogy Crown & Key. The battle lines have been drawn Kate, Simon, Nick, Malcom, Penny, Imogen, and Charlotte against all odds including the gods... \n Conquering the Dark does little to improve upon the character building; rather it focuses on the battles. And believe me there are plenty of battles coming from all angles. By the end of the story, I was grateful there was a satisfying conclusion, never fear though plenty of speculations linger in the air. \n Overall I enjoyed the Crown & Key trilogy with the paranormal blended steampunk storyline packed with action. I recommend the trilogy to be read in order and not as standalones. I received an ARC of the Conquering the Dark via Netgalley for my honest opinion. 4/5 stars"}

I found myself skimming probably 15% of the book to get back to the plot. But it wasn't all bad; in fact, I really enjoyed it. The mystery keeps you reading, and the fact that Verne was writing about an electrically powered submarine almost a century before they actually existed is nothing short of remarkable. All in all, two thumbs up!"}

I'm not sure if there is a true winner, but I was very surprised to see who survived."}

{"text": "I don't really read sci-fi novels (my only experience reading one is Orson Scott Card's The Memory of Earth. I only really gave this a shot because of my experience playing Dune 2 the RTS video game growing up. Also because I was told it's pretty much Game of Thrones in space. \n Reading the book made me realize a few things: \n A) This is pretty much the extent of sci-fi that I will read. It features advanced technology but mostly in the form of transportation or weapons. There's some techno-babble about super computing and gaining \"super powers\" through special training. But nothing more hardcore sci-fi than that. \n B) The neo-feudal political scenery plus the talk about a chosen one from prophecy makes the story of Dune a more palatable to someone like me who reads fantasy books almost exclusively. \n C) I got the Game of Thrones in space bit but the political aspects of this book was a tad disappointing. I'm expecting an escalation of political intrigue in the next book though. \n D) The book took a while to get used to, having to remind myself I'm reading a different genre. It's a good book that does a good job in helping us discover the world of Arrakis and the story of Paul."}
{"text": "4.5 stars.... \n Wow! This escape tale is quite the fast-paced adventure, with a heaping helping of romance on the side. Natti is nearly killed by the Sons of Set, whose leader is none other than Seth's father Sean. Seth brings Natti back from the brink-with no small help from healing powers he's always had and never understood. \n Natti struggles with the nightmares of her captivity-but also with the overwhelming influence of Seth's Charm-see, as a Son of Set he has a gift to Charm any and all in his eyesight or grasp. He can make them do whatever her wants, even rewrite all their memories or lead them to their deaths. \n Only, with Natti, his power isn't complete-he can compel her, to a point. And he'd like to compel her into bed, once she's healed. Still, the more time he spends on the run with Natti, the more he knows he can't corrupt her with his dark soul. Doesn't mean they don't struggle with keeping celibate, however. \n He decides that getting her into the protection of the Daughters of Isis society is the best course of action, but Natti's resistant. She wants to find the secret name of Ra and use it to keep the Sons fo Set from raising Set... \n Seth's plans would be perfect, if only Sean wasn't dogging their trail with the full force of law and disorder on his side. No, Seth and Natti are under constant pursuit, narrowly escaping capture time and again. Good thing Seth's got that super healing power! \n So, the book is fast-paced, the sexual tension is constant, and the girl saves her own day-for the most part. What's not to like? If you ever had an Ancient Egypt fetish, or you liked The Mummy movies, this book will intrigue. Seth is a whole lot more likable in this book, than DAUGHTER OF ISIS. The book ends with a resolution, but not completion. So much more is at stake in the next episode-clearly we have mortals doing battle for the gods of Egypt and it's gonna be one heck of a showdown."}

{"text": "It seems to me that GoodReads members either love or hate Cassandra Clare. I read a number of reviews for this book as well as the MI series before starting and, man, people are almost fanatical about this author's work. With that being said, my curiosity got the better of me and I gave this book a shot... \n This was the first book I have read by Clare. I have not read her fan fiction either. I believe that is actually a good thing, with so many making parallels between all her works. Overall, I gave this 3 stars because I didn't love it, or hate it. When I think about this one I just kind of say, \"hmmm, well that was kind of a let down.\" \n I will not rehash the plot, I am pretty sure the blurb does a pretty good job on its own. The writing was alright. I did not find myself lost, having to backtrack and reread. Descriptions were good as well, they didn't overshadow the story, only complemented the world building. Pacing was done well, events flowed well and felt natural in their progression. I liked the plot. Just enough back stories were given to get interested in some of the characters, and the twists surprised me. \n The characters were written well in my opinion. Each one had a certain template feel, but as long as it is done well I don't mind it. Each had their own role or voice and were capable of standing on their own. Yes, there was the typical \"in the dark about her own abilities\" female main character (Tessa), the \"bad boy\" (Will), the \"good guy\" (Jem), the \"mean girl\" (Jessie), the \"loveable goof\" (Henry), etc. I didn't mind it though because each character added to the story and helped me get semi-interested the book. Tessa didn't really appeal to me, though. I didn't hate her, but she was kind of boring and didn't do much. I guess I was hoping she would evolve into this ass-kicking heroine, but, alas, she did not. Maybe in later books.... I am still unsure about Will. One minute I chuckled at his dialogue, then the next I was thinking, \"what a douche.\" \n This book was just meh? I haven't decided if I will continue with the series.

This makes her a powerful ally for a kingdom about to go to war.

{"text": "This book was a solid average. 3 stars, because I liked it, but it didn't in any way blow my mind. \n I found it in a bookshop before the whole True Blood phenomenon took over our screens. I was immediately taken in by the light, straightforward tone of the narration - think Meg Cabot for young adults. I liked its strong-headed heroine, I liked the world building and the concept of mainstreaming vampires drinking synthetic blood. However, the plot itself - and the romantic lead - were fairly unremarkable. \n Altogether a light, fun summer read, but nothing exceptional."}

I enjoy Jeff's roar ratings; he goes from \"rabid dog\" past \"enraged bear\" and on to \"lion takes over the veldt.\" I am so happy with the way the quality continues in each book. These are always fun and exciting reads. Mature content, btw."}

Between series by Rick Riordan (awesome!), Meg Cabot (awesome!), Josephine Angelini (meh), and Brodi Ashton (meh) a lot of authors are throwing their versions of the myths out there. Bree Despain is throwing her tale into the ring. We know the tale of Persephone and Hades, but what happened afterwards? That is the question that Despain tries to answer. \n Lord Haden is member of the Underrealm, the second son of the king, he has been disgraced for years. In a strange turn of events, the Oracle has chosen him for this year's journey to the world above to take a Boon. But this Boon isn't like other Boons, this girl is the Cypher, the key to finding the Key of Hades, which can turn the war that the Underrealm is having with the Sky Lords. \n Daphne is a small town girl living in an even smaller world. She hasn't left her small town since she was younger and promised her mother that she never would. But she dreams of leaving the small town and going to live in a place like LA. She has the singing voice to do it, all she needs is a chance to prove herself. That chance appears in the form of her father - the rock star Joe Vince - who comes to take her away to Olympus Heights so she can start her schooling at a prestigious music program. She doesn't really want to go, she has some daddy issues, but she knows that she can't pass up an opportunity like this. But things get weird on her first day there when she runs into a strange boy in a grove and later finds one of her classmates nearly drowned in the same grove."}
{"text": "The real kicker this weekend was Gabriel Finley and the Raven's Riddle. I'm just going to let loose and rant using a numbered list to keep this organized! \n 1. The ability to 'talk to ravens'. This is supposed to be extremely rare, yet the random birds/ravens/whatever seriously just jump out and start talking to everyone. It left me wondering why the heck others didn't hear the bird talking and EVERYONE seemed to have this unique ability to 'talk to the ravens'. \n 2. Gabriel for someone who is so smart with riddles is stupid. Not innocent stupid, frustratingly stupid. I wanted to shake him and scream at him, but I'm not sure I could stop yelling if I did start screaming. He asks obvious questions and just appears to be an idiot. \n 3. The bully of the book Soam (whatever his name is). He beats Gabriel up, threatens him, and is just evil. All it takes is one pair of reading glasses and his whole word is turned around and OVERNIGHT he becomes this best friend of Gabriel and the gang. It was like he did a 180, for no reason what-so-ever. \n I'm sorry but if someone who beat me up was like 'hey can I join you on this super secret quest'. I'd be like 'no'. Moral of the story - if you have a bully, ask them if they need an eye exam. That is obviously the only reason why they are so horrible (not the fact that the dad beat the kid). \n 4. Gabriel let in this unknown stranger into his house, on the pretense the guy was his 'dad's best friend'. After the scary, creepy guy is really weird and mean in the house, Gabriel tells his aunt about the guy. The aunt's response to Gabriel? 'Oh I wouldn't trust that guy'. \n My kid tells me they let in a scary stranger into the house that isn't really my response. I'd have been like 'Why did you let some stranger in the house in the first place?'. Just blew off the whole letting strangers in the house. \n 5. The magic desk. How did anyone not notice this huge desk just moving casually around the house? \n 6. The riddles. I'm all for riddles, but every single riddle had the same theory/concept - similar letters. It got old really, really, really fast. \n 7. Gabriel and his group of friends that go on the quest. I am curious as to why he didn't just put a blinking sign say 'what to go on an import quest with me?'. These random people who really didn't mean anything to him just HAD to go with him and he let them. \n Now mind you, the quest is secret. So why they knew about it is tackled in number 8. \n 8. Gabriel and his bird think the other side is listening in. So they are supposed to be keeping things secret. Gabriel is like blurting out all this information everywhere - mind you the birds can listen through windows it appears. \n 9. Part of the plot involves some random friend of Gabriel's aunt moving in because of a house fire. This individual took over the entire household. She starts ordering Gabriel around, telling him what he can/can't do, making him eat specific things. Talk about a pushy house guest. \n I think that is it. I confess I have 40 pages to go. This is like a car crash, its bad but I can't look away!"}

{"text": "7th&up. Rather liked this tale of a spoiled, kind of self-centered girl who ends up moving to a \"craptacular\" seaside town when her parents fall on hard times and lose their house and all their possessions. Along with a huge change in lifestyle, Madison can't even find comfort in her favorite pastime, photography, because her camera seems to have picked up a nasty habit of foretelling death. Go figure. \n Pretty solid characters, especially Madison- who is far from perfect, but likable nonetheless. The story turns out a little differently than you'd expect, and Snow lets Madison grow without giving in to the urge to magically transform her into a perfect teen. \n Altogether, not bad!"}
{"text": "As expected with an anthology, this book is a bit of a mixed bag. It's mixed in terms of the genres but with a strong focus on fantasy. There's a bit of sci-fi and some magic thrown in. \n Heart's Tournament by Mell Eight \n Fantasy isn't really my thing so this was an average read for me. The story was interesting but not really a romance. There's twincest without the sex. 3 stars \n Champions by Andrea Speed \n Enjoyable story but a little too short to really get into. This is one for the sci-fi fans. 3 stars \n Canis Project by Kish Swanson \n One of the stronger stories in the collection. This was really unusual and I've not read anything like it before. I was at first surprised by the twincest (the second one in the anthology) then surprised by the turn the story took. It isn't really a romance but definitely a love story. It's sci-fi and mystery and very enjoyable. 4 stars \n Experiment Number Six by Mina MacLeod \n The first person present tense took me a moment or two to settle into. The romance wasn't the focus, it was more the mystery and wondering what had happened to Jason while he was captured. Quite an interesting military sci-fi. 3.5 stars \n Knight & Novice by Cassandra Pierce \n Historical fantasy with a mythical creature. An interesting world. 3 stars \n Fight to the Finish by Diana Sheridan \n I'm not a huge fan of fighting to the death scenes and that, combined with the lack of romance meant this story didn't really resonate with me. \n Rule Breaker by Archer Kay Leah \n It took me a little while to get into this story but then I really enjoyed it. I liked the relation ship between the characters and the heroic's demonstrated in saving Tracel. 3.5 stars \n A Little Magic by Annabelle Kitch \n This is a fantasy story set among men kept as fighting slaves. Magic shrinks Thrimm and Arn becomes his protector. Their love grows as they take care of each other in the violent and bloody environment. Very much like fairytale. 3-3.5 stars. \n A Good Man by Caitlin Ricci \n I Iiked the combination of stripper and ex-boxer and always enjoy a story with long-term lovers. Told from Emery's POV when getting fired leads him to reassess some things in his life. 3.5 stars \n Gladiatrix by S.S. Skye \n This story was f/f and unfortunately I didn't really warm to the characters and feel their relationship. \n Feint of Heart by Freddie Milano \n This was a likable story although I wasn't totally sold on the relationship between the main characters - Cal and Taren. A little bit too much reliance on eavesdropping to progress the story and the love angle wrapped up a bit too easily but it was an interesting world. 3 stars \n Chasing Coyote by August Aimes \n This started really strongly but I found the magic a bit hard to get into and I didn't understand some of the complexities. I also think some on-page sex would have improved my enjoyment. 3 stars \n A copy of this book was received from the publisher - via Netgalley - in return for my honest review."}
{"text": "First let me stress than I am an adult (most days) and not the book's target audience of young readers. With that said, this product I believe is intended for children 10 and up. I have an almost 9 year old who is a very advanced reader and I do not believe this would be an appropriate book for her. Way to much on the romance side of things regarding Fang Dylan and Max. \n With that out of the way, while I would worry about how appropriate it was for a young audience, I personally really enjoyed it. This book is great closure. I love that in the end I was not left with a plethora of unanswered questions. One of the biggest reveals for me was the identity of The Voice, and I am so happy this was included. \n Max stayed true to character. She showed her continued softening, but never lost her ability to lead. She remains a strong heroine, which is very welcome. She wasn't quite as headstrong and stubborn as she has been in the past, there is definite character growth where she is concerned. Her choice of priorities in the end was admirable and believable, and really helped sell me on the story. \n At times I did think it was a bit to cliche, injuries were just to inconsequential, answers were a little to easy, but it is after all a children's book. \n The pacing was fantastic. The length did leave a bit to be desired, but again, I am an adult reader. I don't think the length would have annoyed me as much had the last 13% of the product not been a preview of a different book. It really makes it deceptive about the true length of the book you are buying. The actual story stops on 344, not 380. I read the entire thing in under 3 hours. \n I do think longtime fans of the series will be satisfied."}
{"text": "A good read but not a riveting one. \n The general premise is a familiar one to fans of the horror genre, an outsider is drawn into the world of the occult despite his belief in how the world works. Unfortunately the characters are a bit bland, the protagonist's cop partner is probably the best of them, and the ending is a tad abrupt, talk about love them and run screaming for the hills! \n The story has a decent pace, the ideas are quite strong, but the characterisation lets it down and the presentation of the research is a bit heavy handed. All in all reasonably enjoaybel enough to push the mark over 3."}

{"text": "A better book then the first book in the series. I think this has to do with the fact that there are events and stuff happening instead of being described everything. \n I do not like any of the cousin girls in this story. I think they are frustrating, rude and a little annoying but that could be a good thing if I feel that strongly about them. \n I love the imagination that goes into this novel. It's very complex but not so complex you can't understand what is going on. I still love the whole cupboard concept! \n Sometimes the writing in this novel is a little odd. Some of the sentences seems to wander in that it isn't straight to the point. Instead readers are taken the long way to a point. The really really long way. \n I can't wait to read the third book as I've had a mixed experience with book one then book two was good so I can't wait to see what my experience with book 3 is."}
{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n I wanted to like this book more than I did. I found her inner thoughts repetitive and didn't really drive the story along. I get that a lot of the book explained the world in which they live better and I appreciated that, I just felt that there could have been more chemistry, more romance, more something else other than angst and 'nobody understands me' gloom. I would've liked to see more development in all of the characters and I loved the additional characters brought in. \n Now the ending, I HATED the ending and found it stupid and like she was going against everything she had said throughout the book. Plus, you don't make a deal with a psychopath!! You can't trust that he will keep anybody safe or let anybody go free. Stupid, stupid, stupid of Mare to just half a page after saying she will never surrender to then bow to Mavon. \n Now the epilogue was good and I look forward to what happens and will keep up with the series, but I have a feeling that the author is going to regret leaving out romance in this book because we need that banter and wit to really stay invested. All of the repetitive head talk of Mare's did not endear her to me at all. It made me want to slap her and tell her to get out of her mind and get to living while running from dying. Seize the day, seize the Silver, seize the Cal and get on with life."}
{"text": "This book was a gift from my dad, who clearly wants to find some common book grounding with me, his science fiction reading daughter. Sadly, I don't think that paranormal romance is really going to be our meeting point. \n Don't get me wrong -- I definitely enjoyed reading this book! As everyone keeps saying in tones of shock, it's really well written. There are lingering, loving descriptions of tiny minutiae and a plot which, if described, would sound like it ought to fit into a book a third the size of this one, yet I and most other reviewers didn't find the book to be particularly slow. I didn't know that this book was only the first part of a series (a trilogy?) going in, and I didn't realize it until I reached about 90% and the conflict was showing no signs whatsoever of reaching even minimal resolution. That was rather frustrating! \n There were a number of moments of pure hedonistic geekery over things like the Bodleian Library, manuscript illuminations, oenophilia, phylogenetics, and, of course, tea. Mmm, tea. By about halfway through the book, though, the geeky joy was starting to feel like luxury porn, like the richness of the environment was the point of the story rather that part of its support and advancement. \n The world-building of the paranormal side, I will say, didn't make much sense to me. Vampires, in a clever twist, actually perform gene therapy when they replace a human's blood with their own blood, so I'm going to let that one go. Witches have hereditary magic use, and have apparently gone thousands of years globally with a strict inbreeding policy -- the question of whether witches are actually cross-fertile with humans is never addressed, despite the huge preoccupation with species genetics, and I think we're supposed to believe that it's all been one consistent social force keeping anyone from trying, ever. But daemons make no sense as a category, since they appear to be humans with mental illnesses (mostly hypomania) -- yes, considered demons or demonically-influenced at many points in history, but unless you're creating a world which never developed a mental illness concept (but which was medically identical to our world otherwise) there's going to be a long period of time during which most daemons are presumed human. \n And that is, of course, not going into the actual implications of having mental illness as a marker of being nonhuman. Nonhuman is seen pretty universally as immediately and obviously better than human by everyone in this book, which seems like the most fantastical element of all. \n Do I need to talk about the sexual politics? Let me just skim and say that yes, there is a huge heaping of \"I must be the alpha male and you cause me great distress when you don't obey me so if you really loved me then you'd let me boss you around and be an overprotective asshole, and you'd totally forgive me for doing really horrific things to everyone but you because you believe on the basis of nothing whatsoever that I could never hurt you which is all that matters to you (plus I have all of the money in the world and buy you expensive presents which you protest but come to expect)\". Yeah. And there was a side order of \"I show that I am a gentleman by not rushing into penetrative (procreative) sex but by instead introducing you to the marvels of cuddling and foreplay and non-penetrative sex (which neither you nor I consider actual sex so it must be an amazing vampiric invention), none of which have ever previously been part of your sexual consciousness in any way despite the fact that you were raised as a woman and these are traditional women's sexual pleasures\". \n So, yeah. There we are. But it was really well written!"}
{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n I was very disappointed in this book, or at least in the first half of it that I read before putting the thing down. I'm usually a big fan of Simon Green's writing, but the concept of the main character here seems to be something I find completely wretched: an boring-as-defining-characteristic man sees a beautiful-as-only-characteristic woman (in this case, \"the woman with the most perfect mouth in the world\"), falls in love with her without knowing anything at all about her, and in the end wears her down with his stalking. (I peeked at the last chapter; yup, he gets the girl.) \n No, thank you. I don't need to waste my time here; I'll go re-read some of the Hawk & Fisher or Nightside books instead."}
{"text": "3. 75 Don't let fear lead you Stars! \n Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Author and Inkslinger PR \n First let's start with that I'm a huge fan of Rachel Van Dyken and was super excited to read this new book. At times when reading mainly in the contemporary romance genre I crave and need something more that thankfully paranormal can provide. \n In The Dark Ones, I have to admit that I liked the idea of the story a bit more than the actual story. I LOVED the meaning behind the story but I felt the actual story was a bit too quick paced to really feel the connection between Genesis & Ethan. \n Genesis is a mere human, who her whole life has been taught one thing to only find out that it was completely wrong. Not only was her education wrong but so was her upbringing. Instead of Genesis seeing who she truly is, her mom has taken that from her, making her think she is nothing. \n As Genesis's number is called to help out the elders she finds out her opportunity is so much more than she ever thought. At first it starts with her being a bit lost and out of element, while been caught in between the elders. Then it turns into so much more. \n The only way to hopefully get her live is to be mated with her. Ethan, has been hurt before and doesn't want to risk it again, but for the sake of the prophecy, he takes the risk. \n Just because you're mated doesn't mean its a love match. But for the prophecy to be fulfilled it must be pure of heart. We all think that we love freely and give it all our, but do we? We usually only give what we deem as safe and what is best for us. It's easier to protect ones self than risk the unknown. \n For Genesis, she's put through many tests. If she passes these tests than it gives her a chance to live and hopefully fulfill the prophecy. If that happens it will change the way between the species forever. \n Letting go and making the right choices are tough, and for Ethan and Genesis it's the only way for them to find what they are truly looking for. \n Did I like this book? Yes, but I wanted a bit more from the characters. Does this series have potential? Loads and loads. Did I like Ethan and Genesis? Yes, but their connection escalated too quickly to truly feel the strength of their bond. Did I feel like Genesis & Ethan made the right choices? Absolutely. Did I like the meaning behind the story? Yes, it was my favorite part. Did I like the other characters? Yes, and I can't wait for more from them. \n All quotes taken from pre-published eARC & may be altered or omitted in the final copy. \n For more reviews, visit Live Read and Breathe \n Like us on Facebook Live Read and Breathe Facebook \n Follow along with Twitter Live Read and Breathe Twitter"}

{"text": "I have had bad luck the last few months with series totally flaming out on me. This series really needed to be a trilogy rather than a pentalogy. By book four and especially book five there were fewer and fewer things I liked about these books, the flaws became more obnoxious, and it became increasingly obvious that there wasn't enough plot to sustain five books. Even at its best the Fever series is cheesy and superficial and my quibbles with Moning's writing just eventually overwhelmed my interest in her plot, mythology, and Mac's journey. I read a little under half of this book before packing it in. I know it is ridiculous to read almost 4.5 books in a 5 book series but I just groaned internally at the thought of continuing. I will google some spoilers to see how everything turns out. \n I hate Jericho Barrons with the fury of a thousand suns and his relationship with Mac."}
{"text": "Mi credereste se vi dicessi che anche i draghi amano l'ora del te , che quando piangono producono perle al posto di lacrime e che possono avere un tablet e uno smartphone? No? Be', allora leggete \"Storia di un Drago e della Bambina che gli cambio la vita\" e vi accorgerete che non sto affatto mentendo. \n Questo piccolo libriccino, infatti, ci parla dei draghi sotto una nuova luce. La storia e raccontata in prima persona, dal punto di vista di uno di loro, o meglio, una. A raccontarci gli eventi narrati e le coloratissime avventure che si susseguiranno per tutta la durata del libro e Miss Drake (o almeno questo e il nome con cui si fa chiamare), una femmina di drago che conosce la magia cosi bene da essere considerata tra le piu abili nel mondo magico. Nel mondo creato dai due autori, i draghi possono tenere anche animaletti da compagnia, vale a dire esseri umani, che loro allevano e addestrano con amore, saggezza e dedizione, proprio come faremmo noi con un cagnolino o un micio. Il precedente animaletto domestico di Miss Drake, tuttavia, e morto forse di vecchiaia, lasciando un vuoto incolmabile nel cuore ricoperto di scaglie del drago. Non avrebbe piu voluto animaletti per un po', desiderava crogiolarsi nel dolore, metabolizzare la perdita e allontanarsi da amici e vita mondana. Peccato che tutto questo non le sia stato permesso. Proprio mentre stava per piangere perle scintillanti dagli occhi da rettile, ecco bussare alla porta del suo appartamento una bambina. Winnie, testarda e determinata, non si lascia intimorire dal carattere burbero di Miss Drake, che tenta in tutti i modi di allontanarla. Sapra far breccia nel suo cuore, perche in fondo Winnie ha bisogno di Miss Drake, ma anche Miss Drake ha bisogno di Winnie. \n Tra magici negozi sulle nuvole, momenti di shopping sfrenato, animali dai mille colori e duelli di magia, le due protagoniste ne vedranno delle belle e, con loro, anche il lettore. \n La fantasia dei due autori si dimostra notevole, e un vero peccato non poter vedere tutte le creature da loro inventate. Che aspetto hanno i topi carosello? E le chiocciole d'aria, le falene generatrici di sogni e le lucertole neon? Non lo sapremo mai, ma possiamo provare a immaginarceli attraverso gli occhi di Winnie e le parole di Miss Drake. \n Il libro e scritto in modo scorrevole, con un linguaggio semplice ma non banale. Ho apprezzato molto i riferimenti colti seminati nel romanzo, importantissimi nei libri dedicati ai piu piccoli. \n I capitoli iniziano tutti con una frase, una citazione che sembra tratta da un manuale per addestratori di animaletti domestici: \n \"Ci sono animaletti domestici intelligenti e animaletti domestici altruisti: tieniti stretto l'animaletto che e entrambe le cose.\" \n Infine, oltre a essere una divertente e spensierata avventura, questa storia reca con se anche una morale, con un finale che emoziona e intenerisce. Miss Drake e Winnie, da vere amiche, sapranno fare molto l'una per l'altra. Sono contenta di non essermi lasciata sfuggire questa simpatica favola, ha deliziato le mie serate. La consiglio sicuramente ai giovani lettori in cerca di uno svago, di divertimento e di una storia ambientata nel mondo reale ma che ha in se tutta la magia del mondo della fantasia. \n \"Ogni drago e unico. Decidiamo noi di essere quello che siamo, e io ho scelto di essere il drago migliore.\" Poi mi corressi: \"Il drago migliore che potessi essere\"."}

{"text": "I have had trouble deciding how to think of the Farwalker trilogy, but then I read a jacket quote from Karen Cushman. Sensel's writing has that same feel, of a protagonist struggling to grow up authentically. This book is far more obvious as dystopia than the first, which I considered almost pure fantasy. \n My 4-star rating is merely a reflection of my own mindset. For the first time since I can remember, I am bored with the \"will I kiss him\" story line. I would TOTALLY recommend this to my middle school students, and I most certainly want my own children to read it. But if I had to choose between a Cushman book and one of these, I'd go for Cushman, for its historicity. \n Also, there are references to menstrual cycles in this second book, which is why I give the age caution. It's handled quite well, but if a young person without any idea about human anatomy encountered those scenes, I can guess there'd be a great deal of confusion."}

{"text": "2 to 2.5 Meh Stars! \n Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Penguin Group \n It has been quite awhile since I read an Anita Blake book. The last book I read was Beauty #20.5. The reason I took a break is because this series went from amazing to no substance just sex. So, when I got the chance I jumped on it. I sadly didn't get enough time to read Kiss the Dead and Affliction before hand but after reading Jason I felt like that made no difference to my reading experience with this novella. \n As I was hoping to get into old school Anita Blake what I got was basically a novella on pure sex. The substance wasn't necessarily about the series but more about the exploration of sexuality. For Jason, Anita's wolf to call and friends with benefits is in a human relationship with J.J, whom also is a relationship with her lesbian lover. Jason wants to show more of his animal side to J.J. so he embarks the help of Anita and friends to show how it is done. \n As Anita takes one for the 'team' she also learns a lesson about herself as she is struggling with her first female/female relationship. What she learns is more about her self than her struggling sexuality. \n This book was just a fluff sex filler really and didn't make or break the series for me, it just was. If you want an Anita sex snit bit then read the novella, if you feel like it is going to alter the series or make the series more than it is then , you could probably skip it. It was an easy read and well written, but left me wondering why I read it as it didn't really fulfill me too much in regards to this series. \n For more reviews, visit Live Read and Breathe \n Like us on Facebook Live Read and Breathe Facebook \n Follow along with Twitter Live Read and Breathe Twitter"}
{"text": "World War Z: War against the Zombies - what a terrifying thought! Well especially if you're a fan of The Walking Dead (which I am). The idea that zombies could literally decimate the world population is what this book is about. Is it similar in The Walking Dead? We're not sure. \n I liked this book because it made it all sound very real. This author did a lot of research and it shows. If there ever really IS a zombie attack, everyone really should read this book because it really gives detailed accounts of what it takes to fight them. My one issue is that the book jumps around with many stories from many survivors so it's hard to connect on a personal level with the story. Also, all the stories get so jumbled that when you're done reading it, it's hard to remember exactly what story jumped out at you. They all kind of melded together. I think the movie will be an interesting take since they've smartly decided to follow one character through the chaos. \n If you're a zombie fan, this would be a fun read but you might not come away completely satisfied."}
{"text": "This novel is dark. If you're not interested in darkly twisted ideas, I recommend choosing a different book to read. If you still decide to read it, here's the basic premise: \n Ig grows devil horns overnight the year after his true love's gruesome murder. With the horns come powers of persuasion and the ability to extract sinful revelations from unsuspecting people. \n Joe Hill is brilliant in his writing style. His descriptions are interesting and thought-provoking, and his dialogue is realistic. This is the main reason I'm giving the book 4 out of 5 stars. I truly enjoyed the writing. \n Onto the novel itself. It is broken up into five parts, all of which following a particular character or story-line: \n 1. Hell: This is the introductory part. It establishes the powers Ig has gained, as well as the characters he will interact with throughout the novel. It also leads Ig to discovering more about his true love's (Merrin) murder. \n 2. Cherry: This section is basically all back story. It reveals how Ig and his true love met, as well as how Ig and Lee Tourneau became best friends. \n 3. The Fire Sermon: Reveals events that took place the night of Merrin's murder. Ig develops his devilish powers and learns more about himself and Lee. A major confrontation takes place. \n 4. The Fixer: This part follows the past of Lee Tourneau. It explores his childhood, as well as his connections to Merrin and Ig. This part, honestly, was difficult to read for many reasons. \n 5. The Gospel According to Mick and Keith: This part is the finale. Final confrontations and revelations. \n This book is brilliant, though there were many parts I felt were unnecessary or cheesy. Like when Lee intends to burn Ig alive in his car... When the narrative finally returns to Ig, we find that he's basically healed by the flames and is now bright red with new skin. Though it's describe as if he's turned into the cartoon version of Satan. Also, many of the powers Ig obtains thanks to the horns are silly... Like his ability to exhale smoke like a dragon or his weird sermon preached to the snakes in The Fire Sermon. If it weren't for these aspects of the story, it would've been a hit with me. The final 10+ chapters were devastatingly sad, but I hadn't been invested in a lot of the characters in order to feel what I should have. \n If you're looking for something truly twisted, or you're interested in reading the book before the film version (starring Daniel Radcliffe as Ig) comes out, I highly recommend it. Just be prepared for some really strange things."}
{"text": "3.95 stars! \n The ending blew my mind. Blame Aeolus. (excuse the bad pun). \n Finally I got to finish it this time. Took me half a year to be into this one. \n So, I just love the fact that all the main characters have their own shares of POVs so I can really know what they're thinking thus I feel more connected to them. This switching of POV thing should have happened to some Percabeth moments back in PJO. If they rescued Percy (which I'm pretty sure will happen), I hope Rick gives Percy and/or Annabeth a POV - even a short one. I'd do anything for a Percabeth moment. 3 \n Anyway, I'm still a bit skeptical with Jason. I know it's not his fault, but I'm still reluctant to trust him wholly. Is that weird?"}
{"text": "I tried to read this book ages ago and didn't connect. Thankfully I kept it around in order to try again. Tepper is always very thought provoking for me. I love meditating on all that she mixes into her writing. \n Having only read this and one other book by Tepper, my opinion is limited. As much as I enjoy her, I have a hard time seeking out her books and getting into them. There is a willingness to think necessary in reading her. She is not an easy or escapist type of read for me."}
{"text": "I really enjoyed the Vampire Hunter's Daughter part 1. I heard good things about the series so I wanted to check it out for myself. I loved it. I thought it was well written and unique. I am looking forward to the other parts of the series!"}
{"text": "Fear is a YA anthology filled with 13 stories of suspense and horror. Each of the 13 short stories were contributed by some of the top names in the YA/adult literature. There are stories written by James Rollins, R.L. Stine, Meg Cabot and other big names in literature. \n Here is a detailed overview of all 13 stories contained in the anthology. \n Welcome to the Club by R.L. Stine \n This is a typical R.L. Stine story. A bit of suspense with a twist at the end. For long time readers of R.L. Stine the story will probably be a bit pradictable but overall it really set the mood for the anthology and gives it a nice kickoff. \n She's Different Tonight by Heather Graham \n She's Different Tonight was by far not one of my favorite stories within this anthology. It is told from a werewolf POV and there's a bit of twist. I just couldn't get into the tone, story line and felt it was very rushed (for a short story). \n Suckers by Suzanne Weyn \n If I had to pick a favorite story in this anthology it would be Suckers. It's unique, fun and has a bit of a \"scary\" undertone to it. A famous family moves to a new planet looking for a new life but they find out that something odd has happened on this planet. What is odd about the planet is so unexpected and just a really fun story. \n The Perfects by Jennifer Allison \n What would happen if you moved next door to the perfects. That's what this is about. A babysitter volunteers to watch the next door neighbor's children but something just isn't right about the children. They watch surgery channels and eat raw meat. This was a pretty \"creepy\" story in terms of creepiness of the stories. I really thought it had a perfect ending and I could easily reread it. \n Shadow Children by Heather Brewer \n This is the first heartpounding, action filled story. It tells a tale of what happens after the lights go out in a little boys room. What is REALLY lurking in the shadows. It was chilling and left off with my all time favorite cliffhanger endings that are so famous in scary stories. \n Poison Ring by Peg Kehret \n This was the first suspense story in the anthology. Maybe I was just in the mood for creepy, horror stories but I wasn't feeling this story. It tells of an older lady who comes into an antique store and sells goods to the family. These goods lead to a whole lot of trouble and then the story ends. \n Dragonfly Eyes by Alane Ferguson \n Another one of my favorite stories in this book. A shoot comes into a classroom and picks 2 girls to hold as hostages. This story is told from the point of view of one of the girls that got shot. Only she's a ghost. It's one of those make you think stories and for teens (which is who this book is marketed too) serves as a compelling life lesson type story but it's done in the right way. \n Jeepers Peepers by Ryan Brown \n From the title I really thought this was going to be a run of the mill story with a same old same old style but Ryan Brown really impressed me with it. Another babysitter story, only this time the child she babysits has to be left in the dark and ends up causing a lot of trouble. It was a bit heartpounding and scary but it had the greatest unexpected twist at the end. I loved it! \n Piney Power by F. Paul Wilson \n A story about rough justice taken by fellow people who live on the outskirts of society. I don't have any feelings for this story one way or the other. It didn't wow me and it didn't make me dislike it. I sorta felt it was out of place in this anthology though. \n Night Hunter by Meg Cabot \n Meg Cabot is a huge name in YA lit. Sadly, this short story took a bit of a predictable twist. It had a bit of suspense but there was a girl pining away for a guy and it just didn't work in this story. Between that and the predictable twist it didn't reach my top list of stories in this anthology. \n Tuition by Walter Sorrells \n Another suspense/action story about a boy who breaks into safes. Only today is his birthday and he is trying to get out of the business so he can go to school. Nice slow pace story that had an interesting (but foreseeable) ending. \n Tagger by James Rollins \n James Rollins writing style is so completely different from every other writer in this anthology. He brings a bit of an action/suspense short story that really winds up the whole anthology. It was my first taste of his writing style and I enjoyed it a lot. \n Ray Gun by Tim Maleeny \n This short story took a twist to a sci-fiy type story. It was so far off what I normally read that I couldn't honestly review it. I got through it but I wouldn't have anything to compare it to to make the review fair. \n OVERALL: Overall I found Fear an interesting anthology. There were definate hits for me with the stories that they included and there were massive misses. The misses usually included extremely predictable plot lines or just oddball stories that didn't seem to fit."}
{"text": "Ok, so, I'll admit it, I choose my books by their covers. Whoever claims not to is a liar, especially in this world of \"edgy\" covers with no backcover summary. \n And hey, this cover is pretty damn great - it screams \"cool fallen Angel story\". \n Well, in that sense, I wasn't disappointed. This book came out in the midst of the literary vampire overkill wave, and a book about angels back then was unusual and original. A bit less so now, but I rest my case. \n And the plot is quite strong. I'm a sucker for mysterious flashbacks into the distant centuries-old past (think Blue Bloods). It had me on edge and I enjoyed it. \n But the heroine - oh, the heroine. She REDEFINES the \"stupid and helpless\" stereotype. The main 'love interest' spends [spoiler alert] HALF THE BOOK trying to murder her, and somehow she makes it out to be oh-so-romantic. No, it's not. You're dating a lunatic. \n So, if you're the kind of person who gets annoyed by these issues (as a lot of you are by the looks of the latest reviews) then avoid. But if paranormal romance that crosses the morally appropriate line is more your thing, then go for it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text": "This was admittedly a riveting read, but there were aspects near the end of the book that made it much darker than I would have expected. I actually had to stop reading it for a time. It was obvious that the author really admired the evil main character which caused a bit of imbalance at the end. He made the good characters impotent and actually went against one of the main premises in the book that he reiterated over and over. All in all though, it was a good book. I will give the second book a try."}
{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n It was short, amusing, cute and cliche. \n I enjoyed it, an afternoon well spend but not one of the best books I have ever read. \n There was a lot of potential for this book to explore and I would have loved reading more about the culture of the planet instead of sucky songs of 2005 on earth. Also the sexuality info dump was cringeworthy and was poorly done in my opinion. Still, like I said it was amusing and I thought it was a lovely entertaining light read for a rainy afternoon."}

If I thought the first book was creative and imaginative, this one was so much MORE. There's more depth to the characters, you feel what they feel, all those emotions pouring out of the pages. Anger, resentment, worriness, happiness, sadness, anguish. You feel EVERYTHING. There's also a lot that happens in Akiva's world of seraphim and Karou's world of chimaera that if you missed/skipped a page, you would miss something important. By the end of the book, my jaw dropped and stayed there even after I finished. SOOOOOO GOOOOOD. I couldn't even predict the direction it was going in even if the clues were thrown at me. Did I say that this book is good?? \n WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?? JUMP IN! \n I'll be jumping into the third book today."}

{"text": "7th&up, 3.5 stars \n A solid fantasy adventure that has a little bit of everything- Chinese folktale elements mixed with romance, suspense and issues of loyalty, class, courage and sacrifice. I enjoyed Fei's tale, even though it didn't stick with me after the story was over. \n This book was acquired at BEA15 in exchange for an honest review"}
{"text": "I have been avoiding writing this because I'm not quite sure how to rate my own book. Of course I think it is 5 star material, but I also know that it has some issues. My goal was to publish the story that I had close to my heart and to share it with someone other than my mom, and I think I did a really good job doing that. I couldn't be happier that people have read The Dragon Within and liked it even though my first attempt at a polished work fell a little short. \n I'm amazed at how close I have become to my characters, almost as if I've met them, and to me that is so important in a good story. I've found a new fantasy home that I can retreat to when I just don't feel like dealing with the real world. The only diference is that I get to control whats going to happen and that is a power I hope I can handle. \n So, I guess to sum things up;Do I think this is a great book? Yes! \n Do I recomend this book? Yes! I'm confident in saying that The Dragon Within is a fantasy read worth your time and I hope more readers will follow my journey through Eiddoril. \n Cheers!"}

{"text": "This book would have gotten a 2 if it hadn't been free. There was (as everyone points out) a serious lack in editing. Inconsistencies, contradictions, and lack of thought plagued the plot. I liked the idea behind the magic of this world but this seemed to be something the author was working out during the writing of the book rather then a fully formed concept. Also, certain characters and whole scenes needed much better development. I appreciated the humor (even if sometimes it was too broad and childish) to help get a reader through the epic trial bits. As for the writing, she is too fond of the word 'but' which really bugged me in the last 1/4 of the book and a good read through the whole book by anyone would have solved some very simple errors. Better editing would have given this book far more polish and increased its readability. \n Mock has a great story that would have kept me reading the entire series if she hadn't rushed to get this first book out. I would get the second book but again, only if it is free."}
{"text": "I thought the story was wonderful and funny, but I would have liked the illustrations to be in color. The widow was very clever and stood up for her helpful little friend and I loved her for it, though it was a selfish act as well.

{"text": "Veronica Roth has a new series that is set on the planet Thuve, one of nine worlds orbiting their sun. Two distinct populations live there and have been enemies for many years. The Thuvhesit people live in the bitterly cold north and cultivate iceflowers which have both medicinal and recreational uses. The Shotet people make annual treks to other planets where they \"scavenge\" unwanted items. The Shotets are a violent, war-like race led by a psychopath named Ryzek Noavek. . His sister, Cyra, is the main character of Carve the Mark. All of the planets are linked by a visible current which moves through space. It bestows currentgifts that lend a destiny to the favored ones. Cyra's gift is pain which is a constant presence in her life. She can also transfer pain to torture or even kill her brother's enemies. I was probably half way through the book before I found her at all likable. Akos is a young Thuvhesit boy when he and his brother are captured by the Shotets because their fates are linked to the ruling family according to prophecies. Chapters alternate between Cyra, whose story is told in the first person, and Akos who is told in third person. There is also a short glossary at the end of the book which would have been more helpful had I found it earlier. Carve the Mark is an ambitious work. I am still ambivalent as to whether or not I will continue with future volumes."}
{"text": "** SPOILER ALERT ** \n I only started reading The Black Dagger Brotherhood a couple of months ago and fell in love with the brothers straight away !! \n Lover Mine finally focuses on John Matthew and Xhex. At the end of Lover Avenged we were left with Xhex being kidnapped by Lash and John being a bit of an ass-hat !! Lover Mine starts straight after the gang rescued Rehvenge and Xhex was taken. The chemistry has been building up between John and Xhex for the last couple of books and we know he is in love with her and although separately they know their own feelings they have not confirmed them to each other. With his love taken John is on the hunt for Lash and living in hope that Xhex is still alive. Meanwhile Xhex is in a living hell being held captive by Lash. I loved the connection that these two characters had, because it has been simmering over the last couple of books it seemed really real and natural to me, and the love scenes were HOT!! The other brothers were not left out either and all made an appearance, and Lash makes a great bad guy !! John also reconnected with Tohr and we were finally given the confirmation that John Matthew is in fact the reincarnation of Darius. We are taken back in flash back scenes to how the two brother Tohr and Darius meet which in a twist involves Xhex !! \n I loved the build up in the book for Quinn and Blay and will be very excited to see there story n book 11 !! \n I thoroughly loved reading this book and for me its back to the great form that was the first four books !! \n The only complaint I would have is that the last couple of chapters were a little rushed and I didn't enjoy the sences with the film crew at the B&B but neither of those things spoiled my enjoyment of the book :o)"}

{"text": "Another fun entry in the Alien series. Kitty Katt has to deal with being a mommy, being a diplomat, and attending the Washington Wives class, which is scarier than some of the creatures she's dealt with. I love all the Poofs--and I love the way Koch keeps the dogs and cats in the mix too so they're not just props, which tends to annoy me--and the new character, Olga, the Ambassadress of Romania. There are other new characters too--some not so nice, of course. And then there's the fiasco, uh, party. Something is always happening. So many characters and complications and non-stop suspense 'cause you can never be sure to trust. Recommended, as usual."}

Addie West comes from a very wealthy family and her father is forcing her to marry someone she doesn't want to. Her grandmother helps her escape and for five years no one finds her. Nick and Addie can talk to each other thru their minds and she tells him she is in trouble in a barn - that someone is trying to kill her. Can Nick get to her in time before this crazy woman kills her? This is definitely a must read and would recommend to everyone."}
{"text": "Wow. This is a definate game changer in the series. I honestly wish the whole series had stayed on this level of writing, because if it did the series would have been more popular than it is. \n It's hard to explain what happens in this book, but it's awe-inspiring and mind blowing. I was reluctant to read this book as the second book put me off of the series, but I am glad I did. \n Pearl North pulls some amazing plot twists into this third and final installment and I feel any lover of books will definately love it. It will really make you think twice about books, plots and reading."}

{"text": "I actually think my love for Faye is just too strong. Why I say that, you ask? Well cause of all the (excuse my language) shitty things she has done, including telling the circle about Cassie and Adam, I still love her! She is such a strong character! This, to me, was the best book out of the 'trilogy'. Nick and Cassie's relationship was just so............ REFRESHING!!! I cant help but get a little enthusiastic and excited but its true! It was better then her relationship with Adam, I can tell you that. But lets face it, we all knew that she would end up with Adam, which made me sad for Nick. Poor Nick.. :( In the end, I will admit I shed a tear when I thought how Smith wouldn't be writing for this series again.. sigh.. just like Vampire Diaries.. But all in all, this was an amazing book and a perfect ending for this trilogy (that was written by L.J. Smith)."}

I loved every minute of it and cannot wait for the coming books!"}

{"text": "3.5 STAR. I did enjoy this quite a bit, but I loved the steampunk world of The Infernal Devices so much that I felt a loss in the NY settin. I also missed the intense innate feelings between probatai that I felt in those books. However, I felt the distance of what time does to traditions and I knew so much more information and didn't feel 'thrown' into this new world concept because I read the prequel trilogy first. \n Clary Fray was a typical sixteen year old girl who lived in the big city--eventhough she knew the rules she skirted on the edge of them more often than naught. One night, at a underaged dance club, Clary saw what no one else could see. After that moment, she would never see anything the same again. Her truths become lies and betrayal. Her wholeworld is in upheaval and trusting herself seemed to be her only choice."}
{"text": "Hunted, I almost think the Wanderer would have been a better title. Since the book seemed to be based on Shanti's new status, other than being the Chosen. There was minimal building of relationships between characters. Shanti's personality seems timid and weak in this story, rather than the strong, confident woman in Chosen. The relationship between her and her 'brother' seems to be entirely bantering and not established, but rather he will follow her to the ends of the earth, because he believes she is Chosen and for no other reason. Cayan seems to be a bit aloof. While the Honor Guard is present, they fall by the wayside in the story. Rather I felt the story was strictly an informational journey and periodic fighting sequences. \n Up until the very last part of the book, did I truly get involved in the story. Now it seems the real journey will begin...will Shanti become the chosen? Will Cayan and Shanti build a stronger relationship, or will it continue to remain on professional level? \n Hunted was provided by the author for an honest review."}
{"text": "I received the third book in a giveaway; therefore I must start at the beginning. \n The book was little slow to start, however it does pick up in the middle. By the end there are some pretty interesting twists and turns. With that being said I will continue to read through the series, especially to find out what happens with Ash."}
{"text": "This is a typical first book of a series. There is a lot of time spent on building the world and cultures of the Vindras. Weis and Hickman do that we great style as they always do. \n I was a little disappointed in the characters, it felt as though all the characters were very flat, hopefully as the series grows so will the characters. I do have to say I hated Skylan, he was annoying and really not likeable as a main character. \n The book really does pick up after a while, the last one forth of it had me reading and reading. It was a struggle in the beginning but I did get pulled in and can't wait to see where the series does go from here. \n If you're looking for a whole brand new world, I was a little disappointed that this is a warrior/savage based camp. There wasn't much new as far as ideas goes, so I'm hoping that'll be something else that the authors expand on in the future."}

Among other characters, there is a psychic, a witch, a vampire, and several other characters that have yet to be explained. Needless to say, this small town not only treasures but requires it's privacy. That solitude is threatened by outside forces in Day Shift. A mysterious corporation has bought and renovated the long deserted hotel and imported some destitute senior citizens to fill a few suites. The phone psychic has been accused of theft and, possibly, murder. Reporters descend on Midnight to cover that story. A telepath is being pursued by angry vampires.

After being alone for so long, will Soroyan settle down and let those around him in? Full of emotions, with plenty of twists. I voluntarily reviewed an advanced copy of Dracones Rogue."}

{"text": "This is a really good story of some young boys who get pulled into an alternate universe. The start was very intriguing. The concept was something new and unique. It was like they were pulled back in time except the date was the same but the setting was like it was in a time warp from the 50's. Very likeable and engaging characters that go on an amazing journey, only they have no idea what it is. All they know is that a young girl was able to pull them through time to her world. They soon learn though that she's been kidnapped. In true boy fashion they argue about everything and what's true and what's not. An engaging, interesting story. Well written."}
{"text": "See full review for Firewalker at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n Lily Proctor has done the impossible, especially for her. The girl who was allergic to the world has worldwalked into a parallel universe that's similar to her own, but not. This world has magic and in this world she is Lillian the witch of Salem. And what a witch she is. Lily doesn't want to be anything like her counterpart and with an army she went to war against her. Somehow, though, during that war she worldwalked again, this time with Rowan - her head mechanic - at her side and back to her world. When she arrives though everything isn't as she left it. \n She's been missing for three months. The FBI have mounted an investigation into her disappearance where Tristan is their lead suspect. When she returns, she is badly burned to the point of death and her mother, her sister Juliet and Rowan must do everything in their power to save her. While they do, she is in contact with Lillian who shows her how exactly her world (and herself) got so messed up. Through memories, Lily sees the trouble of world jumping, but she also sees how Lillian became the villain and doesn't want anything more to do with her counter part. But Lillian won't take no for an answer. She wants Lily back in her world, and she'll stop at nothing - even murder - to make sure she comes back. \n The problem with reading these books nine months apart, was the fact that the events of Trial by Fire were really hazy to me. I couldn't really remember what had happened, but thankfully Firewalker took care of that by sort of going through a 'previously on' portion. Anyway, this book was basically just as good as the first one, if not better. The characters got fleshed out some more, and there were a few twists in the book that I didn't really see coming."}
{"text": "I'm giving this a 3.75 Star rating. It took me a while to actually get into Leila's POV, way longer than usual for me. The plot was solid and the characters were full, rounded and not consumed with their faults. I'll tell you what, Miss Frost can certainly write a fierce male lead Vampire. He is primal, instinctual, and yet in touch with himself. Ias definitely totally engaged by the action and fluidity of the story."}
{"text": "Let's get straight to the core of this review: Touch The Dark= Pointless, dragged out and completely capable of sending someone to sleep every second paragraph. \n I think everybody who have read my reviews before know that I am not the sort of person to unleash flames on a book, both literally and metaphorically. I generally like to think that I'm a nice person. You know, the type of person to give a particularly horrendous book an extra star for \"effort\". But I won't be giving this book an extra star because I'm not even sure the author tried hard at writing. It was mediocre at best. \n I also felt that the sex scenes were just used as a filler. Cassandra Palmer, to me, felt like she was just itching to jump on any attractive guy that she saw. I mean, it's like God, would you stop being so horny?!?! Her thought processes were just so single-minded. And this is coming from a sex-obsessed teenager. \n That's why I skimmed most of the sex scenes even though I hate missing parts of a book. I just feel that if I miss one tiny sentence, it's going to come back and bite me in the back. \n But for skimming Touch The Dark? \n I don't even regret that I skimmed large parts of it. Nobody try to induce self-guilt in me: I won't feel it. \n Now if the storyline was horrible, the characters themselves were irredeemable. Positively irredeemable. In fact that might be an understatement for our main character: Cassandra Palmer. \n Cassandra Palmer is one of the weakest heroines that I have ever met. And it makes me wonder how she can label herself as a strong female- \n Not that I'd wanted to be some dippy heroine languishing in a tower, awaiting rescue. No, I'd wanted to be the knight, charging into battle against overwhelming odds. \n -when all she does is sit around waiting for something to happen. She's the dippy heroine that she said she's not. I just think Cassandra's in denial. She might have this \"supernatural\" power which ordinarily raises someone to the status of an unconditional bad-ass, but in Cassandra's case? Nuh uh, not a snowball's chance in Hell. She remains limp and in inaction. \n She's a snob. I don't like snobs. And she whines. She whines like there's no tomorrow. I hate people who whine about everything. (The irony.) \n \"Great. I'd been dumped in Hell's waiting room.\" \n Huh. She thought she was in Hell's waiting room. Well, I was already in Hell by the time I got to the last few chapters of the book. The constant boredom and the non-existent action were substantial enough to make me want to stab myself over and over again. With a machete. A large machete. \n So it's safe to say that I do not recommend this book to anyone. However, if anyone wants to take the plunge and read it, well it's their choice. Everybody has different preferences. Sadly, this one did not suit mine. Sorry."}
{"text": "This book is amazing! I have literally spent over a decade trying to find it, it is that good! I have a mysterious and interesting bond with this book I can't explain. I bought this book around 10 to 15 years ago at my local Dollar General for a couple bucks. I read it and fell in love with it. I was in my teens and liked to write stories and began to name some of my characters Naomi after the character. However, shortly after finishing it, it mysteriously disappeared. I looked behind furniture, under furniture, and tore apart my house, nothing. I tried to find another copy, but there were no more at the store. I tried other places, but found that I could not remember the authors name to save my life and when I described it no one had heard of it. I then moved and was hoping that packing everything I own would help me find it again, but I didn't. And so began a decade long obsession with this book. I typed it in search engines, including details I could remember. I did try goodreads at one point a long time ago and nothing. I had begun to think I was crazy and imagined this book. I would periodically think about it and wish I could find it so I could read it again. Tonight there was a big thunderstorm and I couldn't sleep. For some reason I thought of the book as I was scrolling through some kindle books. My goodreads app was there and I just typed it in. I was disappointed when it didn't immediately pop up. I was going to give up and then decided to scroll all the books. I was scrolling and suddenly I saw a cover I recognized. I've finally found it. I read the synopsis and confirmed this is it. Would I recommend it yes. This book has haunted me for years and I never forgot it. Not many books can do that. I'll admit it's not for everyone, but if you like a good suspense, you will."}
{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n Now, sorry about the arrogant voice, but I am really annoyed by this book and sad, that they didn't let Harry die in that happy golden glory we saw him in at the end of Deathly Hallows. \n Its bad. I mean really really awful, bad. Full of cliches, \"funny\" jokes, and just... I think there were 10 different spots during what I had to hold my hear and scream quietly, because it, just, was that bad. So why? Let me tell you why. *spoilers start here, but just continue reading, because... well, spoilers* \n Totally in random order, here goes: \n !1. Who the hell made the pumpkin pie lady on Hogwarts express a serial killer? Who? and more importantly why? It didn't play any role in there, it was just... silly! Turning her hands into metal spikes.... \n 2. Albus Potter didn't know his dads parents had a statue? And the other bloke... what was he.., yeah, Scorpius did. OK, I get that Albus wasn't the most fond of his dad, but man! How? \n 3. Who changed the speeches of Ludo Bagman? If they went back in time, he really should've said things he did say. I don't have a copy of Goblet of Fire here ATM, but I can most certainly not recall him rising Diggory as the one who \"makes us all go weaky at the kneesy, he's Cedric Delicious Diggory. \n \" yuck \n 4. Couldn't they at leats try to make the exciting bits dramatic? Or did they? I mean the Avada Kedavra bit was kind of meh and not really important... Ant \n And then theres the Harry, Ron and Hermione, who ... well acted as more adults in the 7th book than in this one. Make ron melt with Fred and George, reducing his mental capabilities to 0.., have harry not cast any kind of spell to the evil Delphi, when he knew his masquerade is failing, have hermione mainly give press conferences and remind Harry about his low carb diedt. \n Yeah, I didn't like the book. And I am afraid I don't like the play either. Harry Potter is and will be in 7 books."}
{"text": "I eyed Generation Dead a few times at my local bookstore (aka Walmart) before finally picking it up during a clearance Barnes and Noble sale. I had seen this book (and the other two in the series) around quite a bit, but hadn't heard much about them. \n Generation Dead actually ended up being more of a deep read than I was expecting. The cover led me to believe it would be one of those light books about school, some zombies, some jocks, some nerds. What it actually is a look at discrimination - in the book's case, zombies vs those still alive, but a battle for rights nonetheless. \n The middle of the book drug on a little for me - not a ton of action, more talking about the zombies lack of rights. I soldiered on, because I truly wanted to know what was going to happen - I just had to take a few breaks because the text was slow. \n The ending picked up again with action, and when it ended I knew that I wanted to read book two, regardless of the not so peppy middle. Many questions are left to be answered, and many new issues had begun. \n Luckily, Steve offered to let me pick out a book in celebration of our anniversary, so I was able to grab the second installment for my shelves!"}
{"text": "As I began reading Plain Kate, the tone immediately made me imagine it was being read to me by a fairy tale narrator. Which is so. Charming. Like the beginning of a movie where there is a peaceful male narrator filling you in on the main character's life. I actually commented about this on Twitter and someone (I think Pam?) said that during her BEA appearance, Erin Bow (the author) mentioned that this book is a fairy tale she had imagined in her head. So it all makes sense! \n Because the book was written in this tone, it was very charming to read. I felt like I was reading the manuscript of a movie kind of; it all played out in my head really well. If it hadn't read like I described above, I may not have liked it, but Bow hit the tone perfectly. \n One of my favorite characters of all time is Taggle, Plain Kate's cat, but I don't want to tell you why and ruin part of the story :) \n Plain Kate is a book for those who love fairy tales, adventure, and fantasy!"}

I'll tread carefully here to avoid spoilers but there are twists of the traditional cozy mystery kind as well as surprises that pop out of the wonderful magical world that the author has created. You'll meet a strong cast of characters including a couple of potential romantic interests. I read this book in one sitting and enjoyed every exciting moment of it. I recommend it for both cozy mystery readers as well as anyone who enjoys light paranormals. This one has the best of both genres all rolled up into one great story."}

{"text": "This last installment of the Wings series I really could have taken honestly cared less about. I really expected more of a 'bang' when the series ended and what I got was more of a 'sizzle and fade'. \n This last book was all about non-stop action. No development of characters or anything and to top it off all the deaths are superficial characters that I met for maybe 4 pages. And I could go on and on for days about the ending. That is was a cop-out, a lame ending, I dunno. I just felt empty, void inside and wish it had ended better than it did."}

{"text": "5 stars for Butch and Vishous, true? \n They made this book for me. To be honest, they saved this book from being a 3 stars. \n When I first started this one, I was excited for Butch's story. I didn't really like him in the first book but he grew on me in book 2 & 3. I had no idea what to expect except from what I read in the synopsis. Butch was going to be in some major life or death trouble, and Marissa was needed to help bring him back. What transpired among Butch, the Brotherhood, the lessers TOTALLY. BLEW. MY. MIND. Didn't even see that one coming. \n Butch and Vishous... MY BOYS!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM. There was such a deep bond between them and we get to find out why. Heck, their connection was stronger than what I felt between Butch and Marissa. \n Marissa, on the other hand... not so much. \n She's the only heroine so far in this series that I didn't feel a connection to or relate to. She got some issues and insecurities, which is fine but I felt like she held Butch back too often. And I hated that she made him hurt and doubt his worthiness of her. I was frustrated with her for the first two-thirds of the book and was only able to tolerate her for the last part, only because Butch loves her! I still think he deserves better. \n Butch, though, is one of a kind. Not only is he part of the Brotherhood, he's also the only HUMAN male accepted into the vampire world. Butch had always felt like he's drifting along in his world. There was nothing to live for. He did whatever he wanted as a cop but there was no purpose to it. Until he fallen into the vampire world where he felt like he belonged but didn't know why. And as the book progresses, there's more to him that makes him special as more things get revealed. \n I like to be a participant in a book, trying to guess and foreshadow certain pieces. With this one, I stopped trying to predict what's going on and just went along for the ride. And what a ride it was! Even to the end, it was one bombshell after another. My jaw dropped and loud gasps happened on several occasions. \n Now I'm going to jump right into Vishous's book. I hope I can root for his romance more."}

With a touch of quantum leap, a dash of tru calling, and a hint of a sound of thunder, The Timekeeper's Son is a book that will keep the reader hooked until the end. I would suggest this to anyone seeking a light, quick, delightful, summer read. A great book for the beach or a long car trip."}
{"text": "Once again, I liked the setting, the universe, the mythology. I also liked Eona's relationship with Kygo and Ido. They were different, bound by different interests/duties/expectations, but they were both interesting. Now, on things I didn't like: almost everything else. \n If Eona made me mad in the first book because of her secrets, in this one it annoyed me even more. There was no need to keep SO many secrets from everyone, it was just her being a coward. How can she lead them, expect their trust while keeping most things to herself? She was the one that didn't trust in anyone, not really. Even f she told herself she was fighting and risking herself, until the very end she was just doing everything for herself. And that is not being just flawed: she is selfish, self centered, self righteous, power hungry and arrogant; that is just being an hypocrite. \n She reminded me of Yelena from Fire Study, both exasperated me to no end. \n I also didn't liked the resolution. It's not that I needed to know what happened after the ending (which would have been nice) but that I didn't liked and agreed with how things developed. Ido going back to his power-mad self and trying to contain all the power and saying \"I don't need you anymore\" to Eona was just sad. It felt like there was no character development. Dela leaving the emperor with Ido was just crazy stupid. The dragon healing Kygo was too convenient. It all felt forced. \n I felt like I've read this story before, but with better characters and story development."}
{"text": "It took me a long while to get into this book. That can happen for me with realistic fiction, so it makes sense as the first big portion of this book reads like a realistic fiction book. It is so not that! The book is very much like a choose your own adventure where you read every single scenario. Some I liked much better than others. The first few seemed a little lengthy and more tedious than the more interesting segments later on. The stories got more and more outlandish as the book went on, and that's probably why I liked it more and more as I read it. I can see realistic fiction fans liking it less and less the further down the rabbit hole you go."}

Josh learns to trust his heart and be open to accepting Michael's love. \n Maybe Josh accepted Michael with too little question, maybe Michael fell hard for Josh without much reason provided but surely it was destiny and obviously a love that was meant to be. \n I enjoyed the hope, the love, the belief and the happy ending. 3.5-4 stars"}

{"text": "Every book in Lindsay Buroker's Emperor's Edge series is a delight. Protagonist Amaranthe shows courage as she leads her motley team in defense of the deposed Emperor. Buroker's characters are well rounded, consistent and complement each other. The steampunk world and the politics of power-mongering become clearer as the stories progress. Action and reflection balance and ground the plot, and the pacing is just right. As well, the romance between Amaranthe and the Assassin shows up just enough to twig our interest but does not take over the whole story, and this love relationships moves through reasonable and heart-warming developments as time goes on. I heartily recommend this book and the entire series to those who love a good story and care about the clash of good and evil."}
{"text": "I've been fascinated to paranormal and fantasy stuffs ever since I was a child. Having seen fairytales and cartoons revved up my imagination even more in my childhood days. I loved watching movies about superheroes, magical powers, extraordinary adventures, mythical creatures and the like. My first obsession was mermaids when I had watched The Little Mermaid. I was so captivated by the beauty of being a half fish, half human, the idea was stuck in my head for so long that up until now, I drool over beautiful pictures encasing the merfolks. Then superheroes captivated me when I had watched The Fantastic Four, then my interest went to fairies and vampires and werewolves and witches and sorcery and magic. My imagination was way too large for me to contain, it was remarkable that I loved every bit of those at once. \n This book held my attention when I got to know the plot. I adore fantasy books and this is just yet another novel that rekindled the spark in my interest about witches. \n The story centers about Sophie's life. She was a witch and was sentenced to live her life in Hecate Hall until her eighteenth birthday because she had done something ghastly in the human world (although I think ghastly isn't the right word for it). There she met her kind and other handful of creatures. Her roommate was a vampire and she became her one and only friend. The author of course wrote a twist in the story because who would want to read a plain plot with a witch and a vampire, right? So, this twist was slowly revealed in the end (obviously) and no, it did not end happily-ever-after because (HELLO) there's two more books for this story and Sophie was given a problem to be solved soon. \n The character I liked most in this book was Jenna, Sophie's roommate; because she was a vampire and those creatures never cease to intrigue me. HAHA. I like her mainly because she was one unique vampire, she likes pink and can control herself. She's a good and true friend to Sophie and she's grateful. \n The moment I loved most in the entire novel was when Sophie made dresses for her and Jenna for the All Hall Ball. The author's description was so precise that I can nearly see what the dresses looked like. I envy that they can make fab dresses from scratch. Magic is cool! I badly want to be a witch. :P \n I'm looking forward in finishing the second book (I'm still in chapter 3, HAHA). \n I give this a 4 out of 5 stars. Go read it! You'll love it :D"}

{"text": "4 Shadowing Stars! \n Source: eARC for Honest Review Courtesy of Berkley | Penguin Group \n The story goes on for this unlikely duo. It has felt like forever since I read the Raven and some of the details were vague in my mind as I started to read this book. It took me a bit of time to get up to speed. If I had time I would have re-read the Raven but that was not the case. \n \"I waited my whole life to find you, and now that I have, I'm going to lose you?\" \n I love the fact that this is paranormal spin off from a contemporary series. The way that they are intertwined is brilliant. William is trying to keep his promise to Raven by not hurting the Emersons but it's hard for him with so much history and betrayal involved. \n As William is trying to protect his city from a traitor, he's also fighting for Raven. Raven's becoming stronger and stronger and William's finally letting her in more and more. The more we learn about William the more we see his internal conflict with what he is now and who he was before. His loss of hope and faith are an every day struggle for him, but with loving Raven he learns to balance the sides of himself. \n This book has so many layers woven together, that we're continuously trying to figure out what is going on within in the walls of this city. We get to learn more of William's history which helps build the reasons of the shadow as well as the conflict within himself. We also get to see William change and evolve with Raven. \n William now has to struggle with a decision between love or his people of the city. \n \"You're the other half of me, William. Please don't send me away.\" \n At the end of this book we are still left with wanting to know more. We want to know the true story behind Aoibhe and what her motives are. \n \"You lie as you fornicated, Aoibhe: artfully and forcefully. I have no time for either.\" \n We also want to know if William and Raven can find a balance between their belief systems and their pasts. Even though this book took me a bit to truly get into it, I did eventually get encaptured with the story. I can't wait for more from this series."}

I figured it would be more like a modern day retelling of the Peter Pan story. I guess it had some elements of the Pan story. Peter was a teenager afraid of aging. Wendy, John, Simon, Tink and the Lost Boys all have their place. \n Peter is searching for some magical bone dust that is mentioned in the Book of Gates, which most believe is just Egyptian mythology. He follows the Book of Gates to Marlow school where Wendy's father is a professor who believes the myths are real. Peter gets a job as a resident advisor along with his closest friend Tina (Tinkerbell) and a few of his gang, the Lost Boys. The books follows Peter, Wendy and the gang searching for the bone dust in another world through mazes, fighting demons using their Egyptian knowledge before the evil Ms. Vileroy gets them and destroys the school. \n This book turns out to be more about the ancient text than about Peter Pan. In fact, it seems as thought the two concepts don't really mix. The book had an interesting story, but it could have done without the Peter Pan references. The very thing that drew me to the book ended up being insignificant and unnecessary."}

I honestly don't think it would be the same without Zuzana and Mik! \n I'm not ready to let these characters go. I want to keep reading about them, even the \"dull\" stories.

{"text": "Note: I received a free copy of Evanescent by Gabriella Lepore via Xpresso Book Tours in exchange for an honest review as part of a blog tour. \n Evanescent by Gabriella Lepore is the story of Bronwen Snow, an ordinary girl living with her grandmother, who is hurled from her normal life when her grandmother tells her that \"it's coming for you\", gives her a letter and tells her to find a Felix Cavara in the castle up the hill. \n Bronwen is shocked but follows her grandmother's orders, especially since the latter's visions are usually \"frighteningly accurate.\" \n The novel opens with an eerie and suspenseful first chapter, keeping the reader on edge and prompting them to carry on. The chapters are usually short, some of which are divided into several parts. \n Arriving at the castle, Bronwen meets three boys, not older than she is, namely: Felix Cavara and his two friends Alastair and Loki. \n According to Ada, Bronwen is being hunted down by a \"Severan\", and we discover later that Felix for all the things he says is unaware of the dangers of that creature. \n \"It follows you,\" Ada mumbled vaguely. \"It's been hunting you, and it's finally coming for you.\" \n ...\"The only thing you can do... is run.\" \n Narrated in the third person, Evanescent is an easy, quick read. However, there was something off about the narration for me. I cannot pinpoint it exactly but I felt that although the writing was smooth, the narration wasn't light. It was irritating a bit. \n There isn't a wide assortment of characters, which is good - just the main ones and a couple of minor ones, some of whom put the whole story in motion. \n I disliked that Felix kept nagging about how he'd been living for \"hundreds of years\" when we discover that the hundreds are only 200 years. I felt it was an exaggeration, one Bronwen picked up. \n \"The cure to your ailment lies within me. If I am to die, you shall never be saved. So, let your father do his worst, for it will make my retribution all the more poetic.\" \n Although the novel is supposed to be centred on Bronwen, whom I thought was too naive, her character development comes only at the very end. We see development in Felix's character, especially as he begins to realise that his selfish actions have affected others and continue to do so. \n Loki was mostly the most lovable character, especially since he is the youngest in the novel, having been cursed with Felix and Alastair at the age of 12; whereas the others were cursed at the age of 18. \n Although Felix's snarky character often lightens the mood and provides humour, it is sometimes too much. His flirtations with Bronwen are not a lot of fun either - in my opinion at least. \n \"My condition? How tactfully put. I think the correct term is mortally challenged. No, if you must know, I like to keep a low profile because when you're as scandalous as I am, it's bound to create a certain, let's say, adoration. A following, if you will.\" \n Evanescent is not free of romance, though it is all clean with just some holding hands and may be a kiss. \n My main problem with the novel was the implausibility of several scenes and events. At one point, having knocked out Felix, the Severan catches Bronwen, while it appears that Alastair and Loki are standing there watching. There other instances, but apart from the narration this was the second most irritating thing about the novel. \n Evanescent covers many themes such as trust and betrayal, love, friendship and of course the evanescence/transience of life and how things happen for a reason. \n What I liked most about the novel was the ending: It was different. I totally enjoyed and respected that. I did not see it coming. \n Last but not least, the cover is gorgeous! \n \"I was scared to death in there,\" Bronwen whispered. \n \"And you'd rather be killed to death out here?\" \n Overall rating for Evanescent: 3 stars."}

{"text": "3. 5 to 4 Adorable stars! \n Source: Audible Copy for Honest Review Courtesy of Author and WLK Book Promotions \n Let's start with I freakin' adored the narrator. His Miguel's voice and accent were awesome and the ability to go back and forth between that accent and a southern accent was great. The whole time I was listening to this story, I had the biggest grin on my face, I adored it. \n Ethan Abbatt is a young adult wolf shifter, whom hasn't ever been able to shift. They don't know why he can't, but this disability has caused the others in the pack to look down on Ethan. His sister, knows that Ethan is made for bigger and better things, just doesn't know what they are. \n One night Ethan, finds himself with some of the other young pack members in the city Kfarkattan, where they stumble across some vampires. Immediately the vampires traumatize the shifters by draining them since they can't feed off them or they will die. For Ethan that blood draining changes everything. \n Even while bleeding out, when Miguel Rodriguez, comes near Ethan, his lower appendage starts coming to life. Which is a new phenomenon for Ethan. After this new finding, he also finds himself able to shift for the first time as well, which saves his life. \n Knowing something huge has changed in his life causes him to go back and find Miguel. When he does find him, he realizes that Miguel is on a feeding frenzy and in danger. Miguel too is intrigued with this young wolf, but doesn't know what to make of the situation. \n Ethan quickly realizes what Miguel is to him, all he has to do is convince Miguel of it. I quite adored these two together. This story wasn't heavy but really sweet. It's about fate and things meant to be, even if they are the most unlikely scenario. \n The only downfall for audiobooks for me, is not being able to save great quotes. But in the end, I thought it was cute and adorable and I loved Miguel and Ethan together. They completely balanced each other out."}
{"text": "Though I do not usually read fantasy, this book was quite enjoyable. The book blends a fantasy world and its inhabitants with those of earth although the majority of the book takes place on the fantasy world. A young man fleeing from his brother who desires to kill him goes to a refuge in the desert which has a portal to another world. From there a young princess fleeing the suitor who has destroyed her world meets the youth from Earth and then the story begins. New landscapes and new types of animal life are quite interesting. Another appealing feature is the dream scenes where the youth and princess visit ever before they finally meet and add to that telepathy between humans and animals. It is the first of a trilogy and looking forward to reading the other two."}

The boys were chased by the three-headed dog Cerberus, and with a sliver of luck they barely made it out with minor scratches. For those who know me, know that Greek mythology is what flips my nerd-switch. This is awesome!"}
{"text": "Wow. This book took me by surprise. I had never heard of it, and only vaguely knew what it was about based on the grimy jacket cover. It sat next to other YA books in the library; its sequel on one side and a petty high school paranormal romance on the other. And something about it piqued my interest. \n And now here we are. I just finished the strangest book ever. It is a fantasy. But not. It is science fiction, but not. Science fantasy? Is there such a thing? Though full of holes worth questioning, the author has created a world where past meets present and future, and science meets fantastical elements. It has real world rules and yet some sort of magic. I'm not really sure. \n Finn is a young man who has visions. He lives inside Incarceron and believes he came from the Outside. He and some others start out on a quest to get Outside. Claudia is the prison warden's daughter. She is arranged to be married to a rotten heir. She discovers secrets about Incarceron that start her out on a quest of her own. Between the two of them, they have both worlds to try to save, as well as find their own places in life. \n So this prison... what a place. I can tell you that I didn't see its mystery coming. The characters were some of the most fully realized I've read about. Aside from Finn and Claudia, I never really knew who was worth trusting, and that was because the author did so well of showing their good sides as well as hinting at dark thoughts, and the other way around. I truly enjoyed the alternating points of view, seeing both inside and out. I felt there was the perfect balance between telling us too much and not enough. \n And guess what? No cheesy romance! There were very strong character relationships of all sorts throughout the book, and the few possibilities for love interests are handled with care and at the proper pacing, hinting enough at something to keep a reader intrigued but reminding us that there are far more important things than romantic love. Such as brotherly love and the love between a father and daughter, and girl and lifelong tutor. \n The plot was new to me, and the twists were some I couldn't predict. I'm left kicking myself for not checking out Sapphique, the sequel, so I can start it right away. \n For those readers looking for something out of the box when it comes to YA (which this doesn't even feel like YA), then give this a try. Whether you end up liking it or not, I can almost guarantee that it is at least different from most of the other cliche stuff out there."}

{"text": "5-I Have a new Fave Paranormal Author -Stars \n Spoiler Free Review \n It was the first time that I've read a book by Keri Lake but I def know it won't be the last. Soul Avenged rocked; it was honestly one of the best paranormal books I've read in a very long time. She created a fast paced read, which was loaded with lots of action and many surprises. I couldn't read fast enough. Not one page was boring and I was clued to my kindle. She really put everything in this book - demons (hot as hell demon brothers), lycans, hellhounds, Alexi's, and many others great side-characters. I was overwhelmed by her diversity, as well as how original her story was -LOVED IT!! I'm not easily impressed but Lake create a one in a kind paranormal book. She created unforgettable characters that you can but only fall in love with. Her writing style is vivid and so flawless that it was pure joy to read. Her story development didn't leave any questions and I loved that she provided at the beginning a glossary with vocabulary; but even if she wouldn't have, Lake provided every necessary detail to keep her readers hooked. \n Let me start by the demon brothers -The Sons of Wrath. OMG, I think Lake created the most handsome, stunning and plain perfect men ever. Demons? Who cares, these brothers are extremely hot and just to die for. In Soul Avenged, we get to know Gavin the most, or let me say he stood out to me the most. He's loyal, caring and very protecting of the people he cares about and the people who are under his contract. Basically, you can hire this bunch of hot demons if someone did you harm and they help seeking out justice to people who wronged them. Right now, the sons of Wrath are working together with Ayden, an Alexi, to kill of those filthy Lycans (Werewolves) because they are the reason why she became an Alexi in the first place (Alexi's are soldiers bred to slay lycans). \n Ayden is this kick-ass female; a true fighter and strong as hell. At the past she and Gavin were lovers but Ayden wasn't and still isn't able to love or care for someone. Gavin is too perfect and she's just a broken soul without memories of who she was or even is. All she knows and matters is to kill these beasts off; revenging all the families they destroyed, while finding the one and only lycan who ripped her own family apart. All she lived for was to hunt those wolves down, one by one; there was no room for love. Not the eternity love Gavin was looking for in Ayden. She lived a unattached life after escaping the Alexi compound, and especially General Wade, living after her own rules. \n But all of Ayden's hatred and despise toward lycans would change in the night she was about to kill this halfling, (a newly bitten human, waiting of his full transformation to lycan) Kane. When she touched him, she saw some kind of vision. A vision that would change her life and Kane's fate forever. \n So what did Ayden do instead of killing him? She 'kidnaps' Kane and uses him as kind of labor-rat, trying to figure out if he's the key to find the lycan responsible for the slaughter of her and her family. \n Right after that, the books actions level increases. Ayden is fighting against the urge to kill Kane every single day until his 7days are up, as well as to ignore the growing desire to rip his clothes off. After the 7th day he'd transform to a full lycan and the kill would be inevitable for Ayden. \n I loved Kane, especially towards the end of the book. He became cocky and stood up against Ayden. His smart ass comments and swag where bliss to read, compared to the frightened Kane from the beginning. And damn, did he get hotter and hotter; the more his transformation took place the bigger and more handsome he got. Ayden and Kane's short but intense 7 days are one roller-coaster and you def won't leave your kindle until the story is over. \n If you love or are looking for a kick-ass paranormal book then I highly recommend Keri Lake's Soul Avenged. I loved the 3 main characters: Ayden, Kane, and Gavin. Like I wrote, it has everything -action, humor, romance, and lots of awesome paranormal characters. It's so much more than a page-turner. Lake created a unique story with a flawless plot; a plot that lets you long for more. I finished this book wanting to find out more about Gavin, my fave Son of Wrath, because he deserves so much *sigh. Just read this book, I was too hooked and totally forgot to highlight all my fave quotes *bummer*. \n ARC kindle provided by author in exchange for honest review \n Like our blog on Facebook: HookMeUpBookBlog"}
{"text": "...another amazing book...that had me in tears...tears if joy at the ending...oooooh how I love these books!!! Onto the next..."}
{"text": "So, this book originally intrigued me because it was considered almost as good as, Susan Ee's Penryn and the End of Days trilogy, which is a huge compliment on Paula Weston. I can officially say that even though the storylines are completely different, I do agree with the comparison. This book was actually incredible! I loved how everything played out and the sequence of events were perfect. Everything happened at such a perfect time that it flowed so nicely. It was very well written and deserves a lot more hype. Weston is an Australian author and it was pretty difficult to get her books, considering I was greedy and ended up ordering them straight from Australia, so I could have them a year before they were published in Canada, where I am. LOL I know that's cheating a little but seriously, these books were so addictive and so much fun to read, I needed these books one after the other. \n The energy between Gaby and Rafa is incredible. Since the first time she, thought, she met him till the end of the book, was just consistent non-stop electricity between the two. The big drama was that Gaby seemed to have this whole life before, where she can't seem to remember a single thing about it. She learns a lot about her 'true' self and how heartless this Gabe could be. The other mystery is her brother. What exactly happened to her twin brother if she can't trust this new life's memories? Is her brother really dead? Or was that just part of this non truthful life she's been living. So we definitely get to see the journey and trip from both Gaby and Rafa to find out, considering Rafa and Jude are best friends. \n I liked how Weston played on the memory aspect in this series because it was interesting when we would hear about the two different, yet same physical person- Gaby and Gabe. I really liked that and it had a bit of a psychology theme to i, which I really enjoyed. It seemed to have brought more to the book then just an average YA angel novel. I really liked this book and I'm really excited to read what happens when Gaby gets her memories back, because it has to happen some day! \n IF you liked this review, check out more on my blog for YA and other genre books! \n http://keepcalmandloveboooks.blogspot.ca"}
{"text": "I quite enjoyed this short story, mainly for it's uniqueness. It was a sweet story with a happy ending that tried to cram in quite a lot of content. \n Reading a book with a time travel component was a bit of a first for me. It was an interesting concept and an interesting combination/contrast of the historical and the modern. I liked the view of homosexuality in Roman times and how that coloured the main characters views on their feelings for each other, or rather if they would act on their feelings. \n The story focused on the situation the men found themselves in, cursed for eternity, or so it would seem, but lacked some depth into the whole situation. I think a longer story was warranted, something that would answer all the questions - exactly how did they end up 'stoned'?, why did the curse break specifically?, more details on how they kept abreast of the times..... \n There are lots of things happening in this story - the action in ancient times, the curse, the relationship between the men, the event that breaks the curse, Tarquin's encounter with the neighbour's daughter, the men's separation and reconciliation. \n However I felt the end was too abrupt. I think I would have enjoyed to see more of Marc and Tarquin once they had established a life together. \n All-in-all I liked the story, read it in one sitting, and was interested enough to want to check out other work by this author. \n I recieved a copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in return for an honest review. \n I publish all my m/m reviews on my blog so if you want to see all my m/m reviews in one place come visit at Because Two Men Are Better Than One!"}

{"text": "Great author.., good to see something new from her. Really enjoyed the characters, lots going on in the book, hope it is the start of a new series for her!"}
{"text": "When I first started this series, I couldn't put any of them down. All the characters were on track development wise, the overall plot was intriguing, and subplots complemented the overall story well. Around book 4 I noticed a decline in all aspects of the story, but I stuck with it hoping for the best. \n Now that I have finished book 6, I am seriously considering abandoning the series. The author is a skilled writer, I never would have continued reading the series if she was horrible. My problem with Expel is that it was painfully redundant and the story isn't moving forward. When I wasn't skimming through Sklya's inner monologues, I was contemplating throwing my Kindle because I was reminded for the millionth time that \"Gage is my forever\". I get it. She loves Gage. She loves Logan. She loves Marshall. I seriously think 70% of the book is her talking about and/or kissing one of those three. I understand the love quadrangle(?) is important to the story, but come on....enough already. \n Another problem I have is that the faction war, which I was lead to believe is a pretty significant plot point, only consists of maybe 5 pages. And within those 5 pages, I was completely lost. I had absolutely no clue wtf was going on and the \"fighting\" was over before I knew it. I would think since we are into book 6 that the romance storyline would take the backseat to the faction war storyline. There was hardly any world building when the author described the actual battle scenes. It seemed that everyone but Skyla knew what was going on and she only knew how to hide behind rocks. I'm not an expert on writing, but if the author leads me to believe that the female protagonist is going to be a bad-ass and save the world I would think she would develop the character better than she has. All Skyla does is call on others for help, hide, or make excuses. \n There are many other problems I have with this book, too many unnecessary subplots, loose ends desperately needing resolution, stagnate to no character development, to name a few. Most are not even worth mentioning. I really had high hopes for this series after I finished book 1. I realize that many series are not dazzling the entire way through, but in my opinion this series should have been done by book 4 or even 6. If the author wanted the series to continue, she should have resolved the faction war storyline and picked up a new one. \n I'm still on the fence if I will read book 7, and I heard that there is possibly going to be 8 books total. I really don't think I can sit through any more of Skyla's incessant prattle of all things love, but I guess I will see!"}

{"text": "Note: I started reading this series as I am interested in the Young Adult Lit World. \n These books are perplexing to me. I roll my eyes at the EXCESSIVE use of adverbs (I didn't know one would be bold enough to use the word \"hugely.\" Eck.) But the story keeps your attention. Perhaps it is the author's apparent knowledge about the mythology of vampires. And her spin on the mythology is interesting. \n Don't get me wrong. The book is awful in the sense that it is written very poorly. (Oh my god! The adverbs!) I find the main character, Bella, to be one of the MOST PATHETIC creatures to be recorded since the main character in The Mysteries of Udolpho (or arguably Tess of the D'Ubervilles). However, I feel dirty even comparing Bella to these classic characters. She is predictably compulsive and needy, and I have had to fight back audible laughter and retching at times while reading. \n OK, admittedly, I am \"listening\" to the series since I can rent the CDs from Cracker Barrel. David listened to most of Twilight with me, and we would have to stop it in order to discuss how AWFUL the writing was. I think the reader of the series was probably a poor choice, too. She could have made it all sound a little less pathetic. (However, the adverbs cannot be denied or ignored. They are there. Oh, are they there.) \n But the story is kind of fun. Not even in a guilty pleasure kind of way. More like a bad habit. As I said, perplexing. If I could give it 2.5 stars, I would. But in this case, I will round up."}

{"text": "Actual rating \n : 3.7-3.9 \n This books actually feels like a story your-rather theatrical-English teacher is reading to you while they tell you to sit back, close your eyes, and just listen to the story. \n The Night Circus was beautifully written and the story line was story line was great, but did get muddled in some spots for me. I'm still unsure how I feel about the book, and I'm not quite sure if that's because of \"book hangover\". I liked how the story also incorporated a 2nd person POV. Pretty darn original. \n I loved the characters, but I didn't get attached to them as much as I had wanted to. Like the love story, the build up was forever for me, honestly. Kind of reminded me of the Ginny/Harry love pair in the HP movies. There wasn't much of a build-up, it just happened. HOWEVER, when it did happen. Their romance was full of beauty and tragedy, as in any good book couple. Another thing was that it took a while to get used to the time jumps, but overall it was an interesting read. Highly descriptive, but I'm neutral as to whether that made the book better for me. Despite that, I loved the circus described and makes me wish I could live in a world with a circus of that caliber. It sounds truly like a dream."}

{"text": "It is 2020 and Alcatraz has been rebuilt as a prison to house criminals convicted of cyber crime. The World Police Unit control the prison and Jensen Black is the Warden. A series of murders in the prison are causing grave concern as a number of prisoners die mysterious and gruesome deaths.... \n The story is a paranormal mystery and the concept is interesting. We are taken into a world where there is a global focus on cyber crime and the prison is constructed of transparent material. The ghosts of prisoners past, are haunting the new prison that has been built on the site of the original prison. They are taking revenge for events in the past. \n Dr Brian Phipps, parapsychologist (thank goodness for spell check as I can never spell that correctly!) is brought in to deal with the situation. Ghostly happenings, spiritual possessions, mystery, physical attacks....it is pretty much non-stop action as Brian uses all his knowledge and experience to fight the evil spirits. However, just why he brought along that big trunk with the handy journal of Gramp's is still a mystery to me. \n Luckily, he has to play pretend lover of Jensen, the Warden, to justify his presence on the island and to allow him to stay close to Jensen and under his watchful eye. Not that they stay 'pretend' for long! \n There is a romance component to this story as Jensen and Brian fall for each other pretty quickly. It is here that the story wavered a bit for me. I just didn't buy the insta-love between these two men with the associated claims of love, fantasies about futures and sacrifices for each other. Maybe the situation they were in (fighting the evil spirits and fighting for their lives) heightened the feelings but it still wasn't very believable. That also probably sounds like a strange thing so say, given this was a story about ghosts! \n However, in the overall scheme of things, if you park any disbelief about the pace of the relationship - meet, kiss, have sex, fall in love - in a matter of a day or so - then it is an entertaining story. At about 100 pages, it was an pleasant and interesting way to spend an hour or two. \n 3.5 stars \n This book was kindly provided by the publisher in return for an honest review. \n I now publish all my m/m reviews on my blog so if you want to see all my m/m reviews in one place come visit at Because Two Men Are Better Than One!"}

Towards the end of the book Alec is described as looking more relaxed as though a great weight had been lifted from his shoulders. Why? Because he could finally talk about his relationship with his parents. Ignoring the fact that Alec has been a responsible and caring character for the previous two books, I find it strange that this is the most important thing to him by the end of the novel and NOT THE FACT THAT HIS LITTLE BROTHER DIED during the few days he was supposed to be taking care of his younger siblings. \n Likewise Isabelle, who does have a legitimate emotional reaction to the death of her sibling, is giggling and talking about boys with Maia. \n Every single character seems to believe that their romantic entanglements are the things that most define them, and seem more interested in figuring out those than in figuring out the world around them. \n That said, I'll definitely read the next two. Why? Because the action is well written, the world is fascinating, and the characters (when they're not obsessing over who they are going to kiss) are fairly engaging. Overall, still a good book, but suffers a little from being in the middle of the series."}
{"text": "This was ok. I liked it as a horror type story though it did pull a lot of the usual horror story tricks. Possessed houses are always fun and I actually found myself getting a little creeped out in some parts so that was fun. \n This was on a list of non-con and I don't feel it belongs there. In fact though this was in some kind of \"erotica\" list it really does not fall into that category. There are some sex scenes but they are incredibly brief and incredibly minor. The main character is a gay man so that in itself provides a little twist to the usual pairings. \n One thing that made me crazy though was how much the main character cried. Seriously. Stop crying! It put me off and I found I had a very hard time relating to him. Between that and his stupidity (some might say naivety but I think he just wasn't so bright) he was kind of hard to like. \n I think the horror could have been fleshed out more as well but on the whole I enjoyed this as a light little read that I started and finished in one day."}

{"text": "Cecile is living with her mother and singing in the theater. She has a cold relationship with her mother but she seeks for her aproval. Meanwhile, Tristan is a prisoner below the mountain and is almost dying. Cecile makes a promise to Tristan's father to find Anushka and free the trolls in exchange that they release Tristan a treat him better. Meanwhile, Tristan see that there is much more happening in Trollus that it seems, and tries to amend all the damage that he has done. \n This books is told both by Tristan and Cecile's pov (one chapter each). I really liked reading Tristan's pov because he is smart and kind and is really trying his best. But I hated Cecile. I really did. Which sucks, because I liked her in the first book. She was so easy to manipulate, so reckless and blind that it made me mad most of the time. I know this is YA, but just because she is young she doesn't have to be so selfish and childish. Her desitions were awful and you could just tell that it was the wrong thing to do. That made her extremely annoying to read. \n The big revelation was so obvious that it was kinda like waiting for the characters to catch up. There are SO many hints and the main characters were so blind that it exasperates me (except for Tristan, who can see it quite quickly but it's already too late). The fact that her mother wasn't really her mother was kinda a revelation, but it was obvious after his father talked about her big change of mind about him and her relationshiop with her mother. But that she was Anushka was as clear as day since moment one. \n But I think the thing that most annoyed me was how both main characters can't comunicate. Or at least they choose not to comunicate with each other. Most of the trouble could have been avoided if they just stoped protecting each other and themselves and just talked. Like, stop lying and keeping things and work things out together. But no, Cecile seems to be incapable of trusting people, and makes whatever desition she sees fit by herself, even if it involves other people. I've seen this type of character before, and it just ruins the whole series. \n I would read the next book to see how the story develops, but this was such a dissapointment that I don't expect much anymore."}

{"text": "Author Cliff Ball draws on his considerable knowledge of history, folklore and Christianity to craft a convincing retelling of humanity's time on Earth. \n Told mostly from the point of view of a newly sworn-in U.S. President, we learn that Earth has existed under the shadow of secrets and lies for thousands of years. As Noah was building his wooden ark to escape the flood, a highly developed race of people called Terrans was designing starships and planning to leave the Earth entirely. \n The Terrans travel to an Earth-like planet and set up a colony, naming it Terra. They explore their new system and meet many friendly cultures. They also meet the Ragnor, a race obsessed with military conquest. The Ragnor attack Terran ships relentlessly and without cause. \n Soon the Terrans return to Earth to see if their human cousins have advanced. They find Egypt at the time of the Pharaohs and decide the earth humans are far too primitive to help Terra fight the Ragnor. \n Some Terrans decide to interfere with human development and pose as Earth people. From the times of King Arthur to Genghis Khan, Terrans make their mark on history. \n Centuries later, a spy base is set up on Mars. From Mars, the Terrans watch as the Great War explodes in Europe and later as World War Two engulfs the entire planet. \n The Ragnor visit Earth in cloaked ships and begin abducting and experimenting on humans. Tales of abduction and UFOs spread around the globe. A Ragnor scout ship crashes in New Mexico in 1947. The Americans develop the Area 51 program at Roswell. The project's mandate is to use the technology from the downed alien craft to defend the United States against her enemies. \n Sixty years later, a secret starship is ready, the crew trained, and the newly elected Present must address the nation and the world. He orders the ship to attack Earth's alien foe. Is one advanced ship enough to match the combined fleets of both Terra and Ragnor? Is America on the brink of its greatest military victory since D-Day? Or is it doomed to fail like no other combat mission in history? \n Ball has written an intriguing new take on history. He keeps the pages turning, explaining historical events in his own unique style. The story builds to an explosive climax that won't leave you disappointed. \n I recommend Don't Mess With Earth to Sci-Fi and alternative history fans. \n Reviewed by WR Potter for Reader's Choice Reviews."}

Combined review and Spotlight will be up somewhere around noon. Thank you so much, Tina and Elizabeth for your time and all the great things you do for us fans! \n Nerdvana. Where happy readers go to ponder their thoughts after reading a brilliant book. I'm stuck there at the moment. My heart is a happy one after reading this! My obsessions for the Celtic world, Mythology, Adventure and fantasy has been concocted into one epic story. Some friends on Goodreads and I have a list what we call, The Book Boyfriend list, and a couple of our lead characters have landed their names on this list, let's just say. \n Elizabeth and Tina have created a spectacular and original story that begins with a mysterious woman who arouses your curiosity as she speaks to her chosen men in hoods about holding the vessel of \n Humanity's hope. Her men are chosen as the perfect guard and to prepare for a time when humanity will be threatened. She knows it's coming, but not so sure when that time will come. \n Every character plays such a vital part in this story. I really appreciate that, and there are no loose ends! Each character has a significance to thicken the plot and raise the thrill. You get a slap in the face, jaw dropping moment when a handsome warrior is approached by a mysterious man, and he's utterly pissed off by the one they call \"Mother.\" The woman in the beginning of the story has what he wants. The vessel which was claimed to hold the, \"hope of humanity\" and will do anything it takes to get his hands on it. He is after all...Aries. The God of War. \n The handsome warrior, Lucian, is persuaded into a lifelong servitude to Aries, only to turn on his own men, his brothers. \n Man oh man, I sympathized for him the entire time. He dreamt of the \"What if's\" always stuck in enslavement for a malevolent man, to never be treated with respect, always feeling undeserving. \n Then we are introduced a Templar, named Evan, who has been assigned to watch a Wiccan girl who unknowingly holds the key to gateway to \"humanity's last hope\". Danger is near and he is sent to warn her and protect her. Yeah, imagine how that conversation went down as he had to break it to her he's been creepin' up on her and she had noooo idea he even existed. \n Okay, you see that I am getting excited talking about this! But all in all, there are many heart wrenching, edge-of-your-seat gasping, and excitement. Thank you Tina and Elizabeth for allowing Krystle and I to have an early read!"}

{"text": "I really thought that this book had a great sounding premise. And it does. But by page 115 I gave up. The book is written in first person by a girl named Eff. But because Eff was used by the author to look in on scenes without contributing anything to them, there was nothing for the reader to connect to. It felt as if Eff didn't even have a role in the plot. And by 115 pages, I still didn't even know what the plot was, and how Eff played a role in it. \n I also didn't care for taking U.S. history and giving it different names anf throwing dragons into the mix. It really took me out of the story each time I read something like the Mammoth River (the Mississippi) and the Seccession War (Civil War). And the U.S. became Colombia (an actual country now).

But, I figured, there was a mystery to be solved with this series. Why exactly can these souls reincarnate? Why is Ana the only newsoul? And why does Janan think that she was nothing but a mistake? So I plunged into book 2. I wish I could say that it got better, but I only was left with more questions."}

{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n I absolutely loved the first book, but didn't think the series finished as strong as I would have liked. \n Too many plot holes and things that didn't make sense. Maybe it was because it's supposed to be a children's book, but I didn't like things like how the harpies were so easily convince to change sides, how God's #2 is easily tricked by a little flirting, how Lyra & Will can suddenly easily lose their Daemons, and how two kids making love can save the universe. \n On the other hand the book did make you think, and I suppose religious ideas are probably best challenged in a children's book :) I did like the Dante's Inferno-esque description of the world of the dead, and Pullman's description of angels and their roles was brilliant. Also, the descriptions of how things evolved differently in different worlds was very interesting - particularly the Mulefa's world and the descriptions of the Gallivespians. I'm usually not a tragedy fan, but I did think Lyra & Will being separated at the end was a romantic and appropriate ending."}

I mean, I don't feel like I know the characters enough or their lives, for that matter. It was one thing after the other and then the book was finished. What was Patterson trying to do? Create another magical bestseller? You could have had, believe me. A dystopia with a mean ruler and a big bad witch/wizard war, SIGN ME UP.

Lo stile dell'autrice riesce ad essere dinamico e giovane, pur descrivendo nel dettaglio sia le ambientazioni che lo sviluppo emotivo dei personaggi. \n Grande spazio quindi alle emozioni, ma anche allo sviluppo della trama che e molto curata ed arricchita con diversi flashback, per poter inquadrare meglio i protagonisti. \n Una storia ricca di mistero, suspense e con quella sfumatura romance che non guasta, ma ne ammorbidisce i toni. Anche umorismo fa da padrone all'interno della trama, inserito indubbiamente per smorzare alcune situazioni. \n Una storia che si lascia leggere con rapidita e curiosita, la lotta tra il bene ed il male che inevitabilmente travolgere i nostri protagonisti in un \"gioco\" molto piu grande di loro. \n Bugie,tradimenti, senso di colpa... e l'assoluta certezza che nessun destino e gia stato scritto, se ad entrare in gioco c'e la nostra volonta! \n Una lettura piacevole che consiglio [?][?][?][?][?]"}

{"text": "Incarnation weaves a unique combination of steampunk, adventure, mystery, and vampires into an elegantly written standout novel. Literally from the first chapter readers are thrust into a steampunk Victorian London world where vampires secretly run amuck, but the public is none the wiser. \n This may sound like the setup for just any old vampire novel, but it isn't. The first chapter of Incarnation starts off with a rather detailed description of what it would feel like to mysteriously wake up as a vampire. Readers are introduced to Lucy Weston as she awakens buried deep underground with a wooden stake driven through her chest. She has no idea how she got there, why she is like this, and immediately starts digging herself out of her own grave. \n After Lucy Weston valiantly digs herself out of her grave, she works to piece together the memories she has of her former life. She discovers that a newly published novel, Dracula, contains what appears to be a rather accurate, yet slightly fictionalized version of her death and she vows to get to the bottom of the story. This quest to find out what happened to her, why she appears as a main character in a novel, and why she has a sudden craving for blood pushes her deeper into the underground world of the supernatural. \n Incarnation is an absolute amazing novel. It was fast paced, yet didn't let things, such as character development or plots falter in favor of a faster pace. All of the characters readers encounter in Incarnation are extremely fleshed out, especially Lucy. It is as if readers almost become Lucy as they read the novel. \n The style of writing in the novel is slightly different than most vampire/supernatural novels. Incarnation takes on a slightly dark, poetic style of writing compared to a sassy, in your face style. This style might not work for everyone, but it really helps set the tone and pace of the novel. \n I have to admit this novel had me sitting on the edge of my seat. Every scene just seemed to get better and better, and I kept wanting and craving to read more. I really think this had to do with the fact that this novel details a young woman's adventure in finding herself and discovering who she really is. However, unlike most of us, this young woman happens to be a vampire and discovers herself with the help of several members of the supernatural community. \n While Incarnation is filled with the typical vampires, there isn't one thing 'typical' about the plot. There are fresh, unique twists and turns at every corner. This novel is filled with adventure, mystery, and romance. Yes, there is a little romance, but it doesn't overpower or overshadow the plot. \n The one slight issue I do have with Incarnation is the way that it ended. I don't believe the ending could be considered a cliffhanger, but the door is definitely open for more novels in the future. \n In the end, Incarnation was a wonderful, amazing read. While it wasn't totally what I expected (a typical vampire/romance novel), it turned out to be so much more and an absolute delight to read."}

There were subtle hints about the original Peter Pan without it being a blatant rip off or doing it an \"injustice\". \n I found the integration of Egypt folk lore and mythology with modern day children and teens to be the most amazing part. There was plenty of action, adventure and stories to keep any reader reading this novel. \n Another great part of this book was the development of characters. I really felt as if I knew Wendy, John and Peter. While it took a little time it really felt nice to have such developed characters within a novel that weren't shallow and superficial. \n Really creative and great novel."}

The emotional resonances are still a little weird with Our Heroes talking a big line about how much they argue by yelling and sex when in fact they actually argue by avoidance and secret-keeping, and the ending with regards to that is -- well, painful. \n Also, I suppose it's nice that only one of the evil lesbians was killed off, but I wish that the protagonist's-eye-view of them had been less faux-coy."}

The world-building is unique in that a dreamer can join in group dreams and certain individuals have the ability to manipulate these dreamscapes and the individuals within the dreams. \n In both novellas, there seems to be an overload of action/romance in a short timeframe. Lay Me Down is centered on a stubborn heroine (Maisie - sister of Jordan) and a man of many secrets (Steven Coll); both are determined to not fall for one another while bringing down an unknown villain. The ending of this story is complete but leaves readers with more questions concerning the lurking evil in Darkside and the impact on it can create the waking world. \n Provided by NetGalley for an honest review."}

The story reminds me a bit of Veronica Roth's DIVERGENT without the dystopia and recruit maiming. Charlie must master hand-to-hand combat so she can survive battle. With demons. But only the bad demons, because, for an interesting twist, not all demons are bad. Who knew? \n I love Charlie's gay BFF Justas. He's a beefy character, not stereotypically done--think Tiny Cooper--and he's a nice foil to Charlie's occasional pessimism. Plucky Emerson Potts, the tiny black waif recruit, will remind you of Rue (Hunger Games) but we get to know her quite a lot better. \n Charlie's doing well in her training, and Caiden is keeping her fantasies filled, but it's Charlie's heart that takes over the story. It's easy to root for a hero, and Charlie defines the archetype. I wasn't surprised by the ambush ending, but I was unsettled by the sudden appearance of Charlie's real father. In all it feels like a good start to a quality series."}

{"text": "First line: \"Nothing ever happened in Ondine, Louisiana, not even the summer Elijah Landry disappeared.\" \n Iris spends lazy summer days with her best friend, Collette, practicing spells and magic more to combat boredom than from any conviction in witchcraft. One afternoon Iris is contacted through these spells by the ghost of Elijah Landry. Elijah was born and died before Iris was born, and no one in Ondine knew what happened to him. Along with Ben, Collette's new \"boyfriend,\" the girls work on solving the mystery Elijah's disappearance. \n I'm hard-pressed to find anything lacking in this, Saundra Mitchell's debut novel. The pacing moves an original plot along nicely, the characterizations are deft and believable, and I assume that Mitchell's screenwriting background is what makes her dialogue so expertly natural. She writes small-town Southerners authentically, without stereotyping. \n What I love most about SHADOWED SUMMER, though, is that that Mitchell doesn't sacrifice an absorbing story for anything inappropriate for her target age group. The 14-year-old girls are aware of boys and kissing, but Iris has reservations about being giggly and fake for them. Iris herself is a darling mix of preteen and teen, tomboy and girl, self-assured and self-doubting. In other words, her character reads just like that of a real kid. \n BOTTOM LINE \n This is definitely one I'll encourage my own kids to read (in ten years), and one I'd feel comfortable giving a girl in grades 6-9 as a gift, even if I didn't know her very well. While I'm not sure parent & grandparent aged folks (male and female) would like to own this volume, they would enjoy it as a quick read from the library. \n Elsewhere: Reverie's review; Pub Story with Reviewer X; Juicilicioussss Reviews; and For the Love of Books"}

That said, it isn't my favorite book I've read recently. There was one character--Gavin--who I found unneeded. He seemed like he might come in handy in future books in the series, but his placement here felt off. \n As I write, I find that this book did have things I do look for. In particular, there was a female main character who did kick butt. And who doesn't appreciate a good one of those?"}

This is where the story takes a high action turn (which I was not expecting) - Nancy Werlin throws in a few kickers and you're wondering where the last two hours went as you're turning the last page. \n Extraordinary will entrance you and have you solving mysteries right along with Phoebe.

Meg Cabot wrote in her blog basically that the book hasn't even been written yet and there's no release date, which is find by me. AS LONG AS THERE'S A NEXT BOOK! \n Anyways, while I was reading the book, I started to see things finally wrap up and stuff finally made sense, but it wasn't boring! There was still drama and action happening. Lots of it actually. This was, by far, the most action-packed book yet. Just from the summary I'm sure you can tell. Now I wish I could give it away and rave what happens, I can't :( Believe me on this, the events that take place in this book, will scare the living crap out of you -if your a passionate reader like me- I kid you not, you will be thinking, \" WHAT THE HELL IS CABOT DOING!!! IS SHE CRAZY!?!\". I know this because that's exactly what I was thinking. But I will tell you right now, dont fret, *** \n SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER \n *** It is a happy ending. \n On to another note, I'm seriously screwed up now. After I read it and was freaking because of the ending, the twist, how it's the last book etc. That's when I realized that it ISNT the last book after checking Goodreads. So word of advice? \n This is not the last book! If you think it, you will get all screwed up like me. \n I got screwed up because in my mind I made myself believe that, that was it for Suze and Jesse and Paul etc. But clearly it isn't.

As much as she's a pain, she seems like a very loyal friend as well. \n Ava...more to come on her.

{"text": "I heard an interview with Jemisin on the Nerdette podcast and recommended it for my book club: the book club babes liked it and so did I. \n I don't read a lot of fantasy, but this was worth the journey. Jemisin has created a fascinating world that is supernatural and eerily easy to imagine. She doesn't over-explain the world or the characters to the reader, which I appreciate, but she moves the story forward with the understanding that, because it's all so new, we need a steady pace. I loved what she did with point-of-view and narrative, though I'm wondering how she'll play with these in the books that follow this one in the series. \n The only reason this isn't five stars is that some of Jemisin's writing -- some dialogue, especially -- is clunky. I'm not sure if it's Jemisin or a hallmark of the genre, but there were some passages of inner monologue and exposition that made me roll my eyes. But those are few, and the story makes up for it."}

This is a quick read and a book that can easily be put down and picked back up again. However, that does mean that some may choose to leave it rather than finish it.

{"text": "2.5 \n Cuando comence su lectura, pense en abandonarlo, pero decidi darle una oportunidad y espero que el segundo sea mejor. \n El mayor problema son los personajes y las relaciones amorosas, no son creibles y no parecen actuar como jovenes de 19, 20 anos. Junto a esto, hay escenas que no se comprenden muy bien y las peleas son algo absurdas. \n La forma en que estan organizados los hechos es rara y los capitulos son muy largos a mi gusto. Ademas, hay ciertos errores de redaccion que pueden ser debido a la edicion. \n Sin embargo, la lectura es ligera, facil de seguir y la trama es interesante. Los complots politicos y el desarrollo del mundo son buenos, por lo que te atrae a seguir leyendo. \n Lo recomiendo para aquellos que buscan nuevos mundos, rebeliones y no les molesten los personajes un poco indecisos."}

I have no idea how Charlaine Harris, Christopher Golden, Kelley Armstrong, Seanan McGuire, and the six others all got hooked together on this project, but this is a Justice League level author team-up here! \n -Once I started the book, I was hooked. I'm a sucker for a good superhero origin story, especially when there's more than a touch of darkness in play, and this gifted vigilante who literally cloaks herself in shadow more than fits the bill. \n I have to admit that after the promising beginning, I was kind of let down by the rest of the story. \n I felt that the plot got really bogged down: to me it just seemed like a constant rotation of yelling, fighting, falling into shadows, fighting, internal conflicts, and fighting. \n In the end, this was an entertaining urban fantasy which was not as good as I had hoped, given the stellar writing team. \n Thank you to St. Martin's Press and Macmillan for providing this ARC in exchange for an honest review."}

{"text": "I actually already reviewed this series but decided to take it down because I don't think I really expressed how much I LOVED this book, to this day. It starts off with Clara, a (I'm pretty sure) 16-year-old girl. But not just a normal girl ohhh no! She's quarter angel. She gets this vision that all angels are supposed to have once in their life, a purpose her mother (half angel) calls it. In the vision, something happens (I'm not going to tell you) and she encounters a boy. Her mother tells Clara that she has to move to this new place and new school to find the boy that's in her vision. So here she is, in a new town, new school all for this one boy, she THINKS she needs to save. \n My thoughts at first were like.. uh.. That's a little extreme don't you think? But then I just ignored that stupid thought and kept reading. After that, it began to connect and make a whole lot of sense! She meets the mysterious boy but just like every boy that is a possible love interest, he's incredibly hot! So that leads us to her being all shy and smitten with him. Now I will say one thing, there is a love triangle in this book. But THANK THE LORD, Cynthia Hand did NOT make it as bad and annoying as other love triangles out there... Which leads me to ....... CARTER! Gahhh I was Team Carter since the fricking beginning! As soon as we get introduced to the cute farmer boy, I knew! And I hope if you \n HAVE \n read this book, you agree with me!

It's hard keeping track amid the danger and suspicions, and as Jeff said, \"Can it get any worse?\" \n Of course. 'Cause there are more villains and conspiracies, and Kitty Katt comes up with the Sith Lord theory as gleaned from the Star Wars movies.

{"text": "Ridley, Leah, Link and the Gatlin Gang of partial mortals have finished high school and prepare to leave their small-town world behind. Ridley and Link head north to NYC so Link can find himself a band and get busy getting famous. Ridley, well, she's in a bit of hot water with a wager-gone-wrong. She has to provide a drummer for a Caster band in New York, or face the wrath of nightclub owner and Dark Caster Lennox Gates. \n They arrive in NYC and meet up with the remnants of Devil's Hangmen, Sampson, Necro and Floyd. And, to Ridley's great chagrin, Link fits into the band too well. Floyd, who happens to be an adorable Illusionist, is not shy about sharing her attraction to Link...expect the usual salty exchanges and claw sharpening. \n Bringing Link, a partial Incubus, to Lennox's Dark Caster club gets Ridley all tweaked out. She knows the danger he faces among full-blodded supernaturals and fears for his safety. It also doesn't help that Lennox is happy to insinuate himself between herself and her Shrinky Dink. (Yeah, these kids have a lotta 'pet names' for each other. I ain't going into Link's food-based song lyrics, but they help ground the story firmly in the YA category...) \n Seems Lennox has a problem, a powerful adversary that is demanding to be avenged, and Lennox must collect the two people who ticked off his tormenter: Ridley and Link. He will, of course, except that he knows Ridley's fate. Part of his gift is Sight, and he has seen how Sirens are treated in Caster society. His mother was one, after all. Meanwhile, Lennox is drawn to Ridley--and hopes he can save her from his tormentor's captivity if only she'd drop Link. After all, that dude is a Dead Man Walking in the Caster realm. \n The story is fast-paced with the usual juvenile misunderstandings and new adult wanderings for a life long-dreamed-for, but little-planned. I must say, I enjoyed Ridley. She is completely self-aware of her shallowness, insofar as she finds herself totally unlovable and isolates herself to protect her heart. She loves Link, but she can't bring herself to acknowledge this and risk further vulnerability. Link, on the other hand, is ecstatic over his new band--and their success--he's sure Ridley is just being mean when she tells him his adoring audience was being Charmed. Still, he loves her. He just can't deal with her fears--she's sure they are in great danger--and her manipulations--she totally lied about how he got hooked up with the band. Lennox is wealthy and sophisticated and everything Link is not, but will he win Ridley away in time to save her? Also, Link's execution is all but planned--and from the last Caster either Ridley or Link could have suspected. In fact, Lennox risks his own life in order to tip them off. \n While the book has a resolution, the story is clearly unfinished. Without question Lennox will be made to pay for his (well-meant) treachery and Link and Ridley can't seem to get far enough out of the line of fire to prevent attack. I enjoyed the ride, and am sure that fans of earlier books will laud the \"Link and Ridley\" story for which they clamored. Considering all the romantic tension and simmering desire, the book is wholly innocent with only a few kisses to propel the love stories...so it's safe for all YA readers. \n I received a copy of this book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."}

{"text": "Everbound is the second book in the Everneath trilogy, which was marketed as a Hades and Persephone retelling. I already have a review here of the first book, Everneath, stating how that was not the case. \n Everbound continues in the same vein as the first book. The reader gets a tad more information about the world, but not much. The writing is still very simple, and easy to read. I enjoyed this one slightly more, as the characters get to visit the Everneath, and trips to the underworld are always a good time in my opinion. But the plague of the fake love triangle continues, and it continues to be useless. As I said in my review of the first book, this isn't a real love triangle as it's not as if both love interests have an equal chance. The protagonist has made it very clear from the beginning who she wants to be with. So dangling the other love interest in front of readers as if there is a possibility she is going to choose him.....is a joke. And a waste of a subplot. \n Like I said in the first review, I will finish out this series as it is marketed as a Hades and Persephone retelling and one of my goals is to read and review all of the well known titles that are supposed to be Hades and Persephone retellings, but this is not necessarily something I would recommend.This review was originally posted on Thoughts on Tomes"}
{"text": "Lots of very nice world-building in this one! My expectations were low -- basically, I liked the title and the description sounded not unreadable -- but they were definitely exceeded and then some. \n I'm not sure how I feel about the floating POV, with half of the book first person from Sam and half a floating third person omniscient, but it got the job done well enough. (When you have sections in villain POV and it's not awful, you're doing something well enough.) (The extended origin-story flashback from his mother I could have done without, though.) \n Sam was self-aware without breaking the fourth wall; he had white-boy-angst without feeling special; he had special powers that genuinely made his life suck instead of making him special; he was a smart-ass without being too cute; he was scared without being heroic. In short, he was a pretty good protagonist. Ramon, Frank, and Brooke made an excellent set of hero's friends, too. It wasn't all spectacular -- the pacing was a bit uneven, although the book was such a fast read that I didn't ever have time to get bored -- and the sequel hooks were a little obvious (although intriguing). Brid didn't get nearly enough development for her role but she got too much to be dismissed as an extra, which was another thing which felt uneven. \n Hmm. So far this review has been mostly \"there were so many ways that this could have sucked, but it didn't: yay\", and I don't think that really does justice here. I enjoyed this book proactively as well! I liked these characters and this world and would like to read more of them!"}

{"text": "The Wish Granter comes hot off the heels of C.J. Redwine's first Ravenspire novel, The Shadow Queen. This time instead of retelling a fairytale that is super familiar to everyone, Redwine takes on the challenge of giving a lesser-known fairytale a new twist - Rumpelstiltskin. Of course, Rumpelstiltskin isn't unknown, but it isn't as commonly told in fairytale retellings as Snow White, Cinderella or Beauty and the Beast. \n Looking back on The Shadow Queen, one of my biggest issues was the simple fact that while it had some plot twists, it just didn't feel like it had that 'it' factor to make it stand out from the other Snow White fairytale retelling. The Shadow Queen wasn't bad enough to make me stop reading the Ravenspire series, but it definitely lowered my expectations for future books which is why I was so surprised at The Wish Granter. It was a lot better than I expected. \n It should be noted that while all the books in the Ravenspire series take part in the same world, they are standalone novels. It isn't necessary to read them all and you don't have to read them in order. There was a brief mention in The Wish Granter of the main character from The Shadow Queen, but it wasn't enough that it ruined anything or even confused the reader. I think the standalone factor really helped as it made it easier to judge each book individually. \n The Wish Granter follows the story of Ari, who is a newly crowned princess. Her twin brother was just named king even though he wasn't the next in line to the throne, but he didn't get the title in the traditional way. He did so by making a deal with The Wish Granter, an old fae who holds the ability to help give people their hearts desire but at a huge cost. Ari sets out to find a way to break the deal between her brother and The Wish Granter. With the help of a very broken young weapons master named Sebastian, Ari will stop at nothing to discover The Wish Granter's secrets and find a way to beat him at his own game before he destroys the whole kingdom. \n What really stands out in The Wish Granter is the character development. Ari, Sebastian, and even Alistair Teague (The Wish Granter) were all extremely detailed. Ari was a head-strong character. She was confident, knew where she stood in life, and when she made her mind up on something there was no stopping her. She wasn't your average tiny little princess. She loved to eat (sometimes a little too much) and she spent most of her time in the kitchen with the servants she grew up with as opposed to the royal elite. \n Sebastian was a broken individual who came from a very dark background filled with neglect, abuse, and poverty. He wasn't handed anything in life and he worked his hardest to remain under the radar of Alistair Teague. His abusive background has made him stone-cold to emotion and reluctant to trust anyone. He doesn't want friends, he just wants to work and earn enough money to eventually gain his freedom. That is until he meets Ari who doesn't take no for an answer and wants to build a friendship. \n Alistair Teague is an old fae who is manipulative, evil and just horrible. He preys on the weak and uses their desperation to his advantage. He is a bit of a fantasy drug lord. He manufacturers and distributes a heavy drug that many of the poorer people in the village have become addicted to. \n While reading the story, you definitely grew to like Ari and Sebastian. You felt their emotions, their trials and tribulations, and really went on the journey with them. Alistair Teague, on the other hand, you learned to despise because he was evil, manipulative, and just out for only himself. Pretty much everything you come to expect in a villain. \n I spend a lot of time talking about the characters in the story because The Wish Granter is very character center. The plot, action, and everything centers around the characters building relationships, changing, and fighting for the good of the kingdom. If the characters hadn't been as detailed or as captivating, I don't think the story would have been as good as it turned out to be. \n There is some romance in this novel, but it develops in a way that is realistic. It also isn't 'forever and ever' love and more of what I would call a puppy love romance. Given the age of the characters, I think it is believable and helps add some depth to the novel. \n C.J. Redwine does a really good job of taking the story of Rumpelstiltskin and giving it a new take. There were familiar elements, but for the most part this is an original retelling. I would definitely tell people who like fairytale retellings but didn't like The Shadow Queen to give The Wish Granter a try. \n Overall, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed The Wish Granter. I really liked the characters and was immediately captivated by the story."}

{"text": "4.5 stars, rounded up to 5 (because Goodreads has yet to add half stars...seriously...)I loved this book. It was a great fantasy book and the romance is so cute, subtle, and intimate, yet at the same time tasteful; it made me feel like I was intruding. The only flaw that initially comes to mind and stands to me though, is the pacing. Just the journey took up most of the book and the final confrontation was kind of short. Also, I think she could have added more depth to the characters besides Taisin and Kaede. Anyhow I am falling in love with Ms. Lo's writing. I became a fan of her when I read her story in Foretold and I'm excited to read more books by her."}

I don't often get emotional reading stories but this one tore my heart out of my chest, ripped it up, and then stomped on it! \n Amazing continuance of the storyline from the first book. I loved the new characters that were introduced. I also really enjoyed Scarlett's character being developed more. The plot, the entangling backgrounds of some of the characters, Scarlett fighting to define who she is, the details- all are huge successes in my book. Another perfectly presented story for me as a reader by a very talented dynamic duo! Loved it!"}
{"text": "I am addicted to the Sookie Stackhouse books and have been binge-reading them for a few weeks. I don't know how Charlaine Harris managed to make each one even more compelling than the previous installment in this series. All Together Dead takes things to a new level. First of all, this is a sexy book while also being an extremely violent one. Sookie is committed to accompanying the vampire queen of Louisiana to a vampire summit in Rhodes, Illinois. This will be a complicated mission since the queen has to stand trial for the murder of her husband and Sookie is the only human witness to the crime. Plus, Sookie will be called upon to use her telepathic powers to find out who is plotting against the vampires. Add to that, her current boyfriend (a weretiger) and only two previous loves (vampires) will all be in attendance. Sookie's life if nothing if not complicated.

I have read many vampire books...and I hope to read many more...I just hope the others that follow are as well written as this one!!! Each and every character...each and every word...each and every page...were perfectly created. Holly Black did an amazing job telling a story about a seventeen year old girl...who lived in a world of madness, and yet, kept it together...and knew exactly what she needed to do...to keep living...to keep being human...while at the same time falling in love with a vampire. The words she used...were perfect...and with each step of the story...her words drew you on...wanting more!!! I truly recommend this book to everyone...especially those that love a good love story...but also to those who know what it means to be human...in a world full of monsters...lol"}

{"text": "Orson Scott Card has woven mythology, theology and magic into a fascinating tale set in a middle-class African-American suburb of Los Angeles. This book tells the story of Mack Street, a changeling baby who mysteriously appears in the opening pages. He is adopted by an unmarried nurse and mentored by the teenage boy who lives next door. Mack is a good child but different from his peers. Early in his adolescence, Mack discovers a strange house that no one else can see. It is a portal that connects our world with the world of the fairies. Mack passes back and forth through this doorway and spends years exploring the fairy world. He quickly notices that days in that realm might translate to minutes or hours in our time. However, Mack and his neighborhood are about to be swept up in an epic battle between good and evil that transverses both universes. Although there were times when I felt that this book somewhat jumped the rails, in the end it was a good story worth reading. I'm more familiar with Orson Scott Card from his Ender books but I believe that I will try some more of his fantasy writing."}

And as you noticed, I read this thing in one sitting."}
{"text": "This is the fifth novella in a series and best enjoyed when read in order--but definitely must read book four, LOVING BLITZ, for this to make sense. \n Calder is a Dockalfar, a dark elf, hated and feared by the light elves of North Pole City, including Prince Jack Frost. He's only been granted access to the city so he can train his younger brother, the beloved Rein Dear Cupid, to control his magic--so he doesn't harm anyone. Calder is a solitary elf, never looking to engage in a fight, but he's formidable and a near-giant in stature. All Calder has ever longed for is a man to share his life with; but Dockalfar males don't couple, and no Christmas elf, Tin Soldier, or winter faery would have him. \n Still, Calder is attracted to Donner, the prickliest of all Rein Dears. His violet eyes seem to call for him, and Calder can't help volunteering his services as a stand-in escort to Donner in the preparations for Jack Frost and Rudy's wedding. Also, he's eager to assist when there's trouble in the town--building new gingerbread houses for elves displaced by avalanche. \n Donner's mystified by Calder. He should be evil and mischievous, but isn't. He's kind and generous, and uses his magic for good whenever he can. It's upsetting for Donner to have all his notions regarding Dockalfar up-ended, even if Calder is the one good one of the lot. And, there's no question that Calder is good. And attractive. And so very tall and strong and...oh, sugar plums! Donner's falling hard for Calder, despite his best intentions. I liked this one, and really wanted it to be longer. Enemies-to-lovers are always a fun read, and this is no exception. I loved how Calder and Cupid's brother semi-redeemed himself, and how we've got one final romance to look forward to in next year's story: Dasher wooing the ice-cold heart of the King of Frost back to life!"}

{"text": "SUMMARY \n When Sapphire's father disappears, most people say he's been drowned, although the more vicious of the townspeople say he ran off with another woman. But neither Sapphy or her brother Conor believe either story. Raised on the coast of Cornwall, they have an intimate connection to the sea and her mysteries. Neither of them realizes quite how intimate. When Sapphire feels an irresistible call to the ocean, she must choose where her loyalties lie - to her Air family and the brother whom she adores, or to Ingo, whose power thrums in her veins. \n MY OPINION \n When I stumbled upon it in a Paperback Swap, the premise of Ingo appealed to my YA-fantasy-genes. Unfortunately, the execution is a little weak. The characters are not fully described, so that when one of them (Sapphy, frequently) does something that shows a complexity of heart and mind, I wasn't quite sure how we'd gotten to that place. There are some really lovely moments, like Sapphire mentally connecting to a dolphin while riding it, or a conversation her brother Conor has with honeybees. There are also some awkward moments. Sapphire, frankly, drones on and on about her connection to the ocean, but when her mother's new boyfriend suggests Sapphire should have the dog she's always wanted, Sapphire rethinks her loyalty to Ingo. \n Overall, this is a more mature and vivid, almost mystical, view of merpeople than, for example, The Tale of Emily Windsnap.\" It has the poignant sadness of the original version of \"A Little Mermaid,\" and it reflects Dunmore's deep, abiding love and respect for the sea. \n By the way, I found a particularly vile review on Amazon, and had to respond to it. The reviewer (from Georgia) warns that the contents of the book are junk and will cause the reader to go straight to hell. Why she's letting her children read books at all is beyond me, but in my response, I used the word \"villipend\"!!"}

I'm pretty sure on my 'Favourites List' that this would be #1! IT WAS THAT GOOD. You are, yet again, placed in the middle of Suze's school year and you meet a new character who surprises you A LOT might I just say. The end of this book has a little bit of a twist to it and you are shocked but yet happy. This book takes so many turns and you are literally shocked that Meg Cabot would even think of writing something like that. For example, she gets one character to almost kill majority of the main characters and its a close one too! I guess you're just going to have to read and find out what happens there ;) One new face I did LOVE to meet was Suze's best friend from back home, Gina! Gosh, I love her. She's that wild friend that you have that has NO fear and is BOY CRAZY yet super loyal and will never let you down. \n So much stuff happens in this book that you can't even wait for the next one! Cabot's way of writing is so fantastic that you don't even feel overwhelmed with all the drama that comes in this book and later on. I also found that Cabot made Suze so relatable to young girls and just girls in general, like myself. And that's why I loved this book."}

{"text": "Before I get into the review, let me just point out that Atlantia is horribly mis-marketed. If it had been marketed properly, I probably would not have picked it up. From the synopsis and the cover art, it is implied that this is going to be a mermaid story. It is not. It is a dystopian taking place in an city enclosed underwater. This wouldn't be a problem, except for the fact that I wasn't even able to finish Condie's other dystopian series, Matched. If I would have known I was heading into another dystopian, I probably would have passed on this one. \n As with Condie's Matched series, I found the world building in this story to be lackluster. There is a strong focus on the religious beliefs of this society, but other than that, there is no real reason given for why the rules, regulations, and rituals of the society exists. We also are not given much actual description of what is probably a very cool underwater world. \n The characters of Atlantia are also pretty flat. I found our main character to be very similar to the main character in Matched. I didn't understand many of her motives. She discusses how disconnected she felt from her twin sister, but then is spending all of her time trying to get back to her sister because she \"needs\" her. It doesn't match up. Thankfully, this story was lighter on the romance than Matched was, and that was my biggest concern. I wasn't attached to the romance in this story, but I wasn't particularly bothered with it either. The villain was also a mustache-twirling bad guy, and very one dimensional. \n Lastly, I found the plot generally enjoyable. It was a slow read at times, but there was a mystery element to it that I found engaging. Parts of that mystery element did drag, but overall, I still wanted to know how everything was going to turn out. By the end, I was left with all of my questions answered and was glad it wasn't extended out into an unnecessary trilogy. \n This review was originally posted on Thoughts on Tomes"}

{"text": "I really liked it! I was surprised how much I enjoyed this book! \n I think the appeal lay in a combination of the characters and dialogue, with the characters being so engaging and with so much humour and cute flirting. \n \"...When I see something I want, what's the point in pretending I don't? And I want you, baby?\" \n \"Baby?\" \n \"Well, sex on a stick just seemed too long to pronounce, so, yeah, baby.\" \n The attraction is instant when Leyland and Jake meet - it's that werewolf mating thing, when you find your mate you just know it! - and they pretty much get it on straight away. The sex scenes are sizzling and I don't think I have ever read a sex scene on horseback before - very unique! \n With mating and claiming comes instant love and the conversation reflects this. There are some lines that should sound corny but are just adorably cute. It's so sweet to see Jake's alpha instincts kick in and him to go all protective over Leyland. \n The complication lies in Leyland being a tri-omega. He needs two mates and regular claiming, just to stay alive. The third in this relationship happens to be just the guy I was hoping it would turn out to be and the three together are brilliant, with the relationship being well balanced. \n It is so amusing the watch Jake, the Alpha, in action with his mates. \"I don't understand this. I'm supposed to be the alpha here. I'm the man in charge, the ruler. How is it that neither of my mates gives me any respect? Where did I go wrong?\" Jake said to no one in particular. \n There's a nice theme in this series about acceptance and understanding. The Tri-omega is unique and there is some question about the rest of the small pack accepting Leyland's place with their Alpha. \"Gregory, I didn't ask to be born this way any more than you asked to be born below an alpha ranking.We are born to be who we are, and nothing can change that. Our only choice is how we use what we have been given.\" \n The only part of the story I really didn't enjoy was the punishment dished out to Leyland by his mates, albeit at the advise of his fathers. It was essential to the story line but I still didn't really like it as it seemed too much that they were treating him as a child. \n This is a story that does contain some world building, particularly in explaining the role of the tri-omega to the pack but really this is limited. The story is more focused on the relationship building. \n Note: There were quite a few editing errors including spelling mistakes and strange symbols in my Kindle version but they weren't too distracting for me. So just a warning in case this type of thing puts you off. The errors were less in the subsequent books I have read so far. \n I now publish all my m/m reviews on my blog so if you want to see all my m/m reviews in one place come visit at Because Two Men Are Better Than One!"}
{"text": "Chronicles of Steele: Raven by Pauline Creeden is my first ever steampunk read, and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed both the genre and Creeden's storytelling. The book is divided into four episodes, each is subdivided into scenes. \n The novel is about Raven Steele, a reaper. Reapers are not entirely mercenaries, or at least they did not start out as such. Their main code is, for every life they take, they must redeem it by saving another. This code stops them from falling in a downward spiral of becoming unfeeling and heartless. \n The novel opens with Raven having made up her mind to go to Gregory and declare her love for him. On the way, a broken automated horse pulling a carriage lands in the water and Raven saves the young boy in the carriage. The boy turns out to be the young Baron, the second in line to rule New Haven. Raven is taken to the Duke and there his older son, Solomon, tells her that the young Baron, Darius, has a demon and that he just suffered a failed exorcism. He asks her to take his brother to the Wood Witch to cure him, or their father, the Duke, will kill him. Raven sees an opportunity to redeem herself by rescuing Darius. \n At the beginning of the novel, we see Raven trying to think of other people as human. A short while after that thought and in her first confrontation in the book, Raven is arrested and the scene is described with \"...gripped the chain between the cuffs and pulled her forward like an ox.\" The image is highly ironic as she tries to think of others as people, whereas such people treat her like an animal even though she gets out of her way and saves a life. \n Throughout the book, Raven tries to escape the Duke's guard to get Darius to the Wood Witch. Getting there isn't easy, but the worse is yet to come as it turns out the Darius is very special and the Wood Witch has much better and bigger plans. \n The novel is narrated in the third person. The language is simple with many beautiful images: \n \"Sunlight sifted through and between the buildings stacked next to one another like books on a shelf.\" \n Every scene in every episode begins with a few lines of advice or notes in the reapers' code. For instance \"Defeat is a state of mind. The loser is not the person who fails, but one who gives up. If one never gives up, lost ground can be easily recovered when the opportunity presents itself.\" Also, \"Actions must be guided by reason, not emotion. The moment decisions become based on feelings, one will err\". \n I particularly liked Credeen's use and choice of colours in these lines, which reflect both Raven's and the author's views as to the Duke's choice since his guard wears brown coats. \"Brown might be a good colour for a dirty job, but a bloody one? As a reaper, Raven wore black - the appropriate colour for the purpose.\" \n In the Chronicles of Steele, there are many bits of sound and advice and food for thought. For example, Raven is highly intelligent and calculating, often anticipating her opponents' moves. In one scene, she tells Darius, \"You don't have to be faster than a bullet, you just need to be smarter than the man holding the gun.\" \n Despite being such a strong character, certain little things still get to Raven. She's hard on the outside but afraid of a tiny thing like spiders. This makes her character more realistic and believable. \"As a reaper, she trained to conquer her fear. Yet the thought of eight hairy legs creeping across her skin made her cringe.\" \n Moreover, we say Raven develop, particularly in terms of emotions. She begins to care for Darius and worries about him. Is he cold? Is he well fed? Later, she draws strength from his faith and trust in her. \n Chronicles of Steele is rich in characters from Raven, to Monroe, Captain Jack Grant, Darius, Colton and even Nikki the dog. Credeen's storytelling is enjoyable and when you think you've been let down, Credeen shows you she's just been teasing - I liked that bit. \n What I particularly loved about the novel is that it mixed so many genres into one beautiful read. It is action, adventure, disguise, mystery, fantasy and supernatural with a tiny tinge of romance. \n \"That woman's passion was like a storm, and he could either cower from the lightning, or be brace and stand in the rain.\" \n Note: I received a free copy in return for an honest review and as part of the Chronicles of Steele: Raven blog tour. \n Note: The books were originally published separately, though my copy is of all four episodes."}

{"text": "Okay. First off, what I didn't like: \n -the fact that this book felt way too much like a set up for The Dark Artifices \n -not enough sizzy scenes \n -way too many povs in the book. Half of them were just plain unnecessary and just muddled the story and dragged it on \n -that the book is around 700 pages and there are times where it really feels like its lagging \n -the fact that it feels like I'm missing out on so many references if I'm not caught up in all the shadowhunter facts and family tree and stuff \n -how Cassandra Clare handled sizzy \n -how when Mrs. Clare killed off some characters Jordan, Raphael, Maureen etc. it felt really anti-climatic and nonchalant. It didn't really have a huge impact or have any effect at all, really \n -the book was really angsty, which is fine, if there were enough balance and plot to actually balance it out (it wasn't) \n -the ending made me furious for a variety of reasons \n -the fact that when I finished this book I felt worst than before I even started reading it \n What I liked: \n -Jace isn't an annoying, arrogant asshole (well, at least not as much as he is in the other books) \n -Clary isn't as much of a stupid, selfish bitch compared to CoLS \n -It's TMI (nostalgia really has an effect) \n My thoughts: \n I feel like Helen and Aline were in the book for a reason. Like, there were a lot of scenes where they were mentioned, even if it was for a second or two. This makes me excited because they seem like a really interesting couple and I hope they play a role in TDA. Also, does anyone even really care about Maia or Jordan?"}

{"text": "3.5 stars, 5/6th&up \n Beloved author of the YA Shatter Me trilogy, Tahereh Mafi's latest is a middle grade fantasy that pays homage to the Alice in Wonderland story in a fresh, new way- keeping the strange, slightly disturbing, yet irresistible feel that Carroll portrayed so well, but really making Alice and Wonderland/Furthermore her own. \n Alice Queensmeadow lives in an amazing world of color and magic, community and adventure, yet she is not happy. Her father disappeared three years ago, her mother barely acknowledges that she exists, and because she has no discernable magic skills and barely any color of her own, she is basically an outcast in Ferenwood. With nothing to lose, Alice decides to prove her worth and find her father- the only person who ever seemed to care for her and love her despite her flaws. With the unwelcome help of Oliver (a boy with a mission and secrets of his own), Alice enters the world of Furthermore and finds that nothing in this new world, or in her old life, is as it seems. \n Furthermore is a land that lives, breathes, and schemes- almost a character in itself. While in this strange land, Alice grows up and starts to come into her own. She is a complex character who changes during her adventure as she moves away from childhood and begins to see more than just her own concerns and needs. That is not to say this is a heavy book, though- there are plenty of crazy challenges, mad characters, and suspenseful experiences to entertain readers, and the vivid and colorful (pun intended) world Mafi created gives readers lots to explore. \n Side note: the chapter breaks are adorable. \n This book was obtained at BEA16, in exchange for an honest review."}
{"text": "Okay, so this is a M/M urban fantasy which is fourth in a series. I haven't read the previous three books in the series. Sometimes that's okay--however, in this case, I probably should have enjoyed this book more had I followed the series. \n I also thought the book would be more about a sidekick, but it was rather halfsies, with several points of view. \n The language was fun and playful, with good wit and a zany plot. \n This is an urban fantasy, so there exist dragons, sorcerers, dwarves, Fae, half-breeds and mythical tricksters from many traditions including Coyotes from the American southwest. \n Spencer is a half-Coyote who has been shunned by his clan and is fair game for any amount of tricking (harmless) or pranking (potentially lethal) that any Coyotes want to inflict upon him. Coyotes live to swindle, and their favorite prey are Dragons who are wealthy and inordinately gullible. There exists a Sorcerer King, the Ra'keth--also known as the Lightning Rod--who happens to Spencer's best friend, James Black, and for whom Spencer has a secret love. Thing is, as a Coyote, Spencer is bound to trick James, which will likely lead to James' death. \n And, James has a steady boyfriend, Ollie, a half-dwarf--who knows EXACTLY how Spencer feels for James, even if a James is oblivious. \n James is captured by the Dragons, for his \"protection\", because-while James is powerful-he is unskilled and not interested in engaging in the usual Ra'keth antics of world domination. For this, James is perceived as weak, and the dragons are duty-bound to protect him... \n Ollie and Spencer seek to reclaim their love, and are waylaid by the Cobalt Order, a sect of Fae who wish to exterminate all half-bloods. Spencer is able to shield Ollie, but both men are in big trouble. Plus, no one can find James in the Dragon realm. \n This book has a LOT going on. Intricate plot lines abound. Intrigue and double-crosses. Near-death experiences and actual fatalities. What I missed? The heat. All the smexytimes are mentioned and moved on. I honestly could have thought this was all bromance except there's a little dirty talk. \n Took me a bit of time to get oriented to this world, and the multiple POV left more room for redundancy than I would have liked. Perfect read for Dungeons & Dragons fans, what with the copious references to the RP game. \n I received a review copy of this book via NetGalley."}

{"text": "What a boring book. I feel like I slept through most of it. Ugh, jus disappointing all the way around. I was expecting something much more intriguing and adventurous but this was just dull. Nix was annoying and rather pathetic for my taste. The Love Triangle was awful and the characters weren't relatable or lovable. It was a weird book about addiction rather than time travel. There wasn't actually a lot of time traveling -- I mean there was some but not enough to keep me interested. \n The motivations of the characters were weird. I found their plans and schemes unnecessarily complex. I know little to nothing about Hawaii in the 1800s so more explanation would have been nice. I got lost a lot trying to uncover this myth and that political history. They were bystanders to it all and it wasn't interesting or captivating. \n Also, the time traveling system was confusing. I had NO idea how or why it worked. I wanted more of an origin to all of this. You can just travel to any authentic map based on belief?? I'm sorry but that's a lot of hogwash, mumbo jumbo and I couldn't get on board for it. They also went to fantasy places...and they seemed to be the only people that could do this...and yet they didn't really need a ship...and you could travel from anywhere simply based on belief...I just didn't understand a lick of it. I had too many questions and it was distracting from the lack of plot. \n Don't waste your time. Seriously, it's not worth it. I won't be reading the rest of the series unless I have to for YA Booktube Awards but even then, you might have to pay me. \n Conclusion: Nope."}
{"text": "When I first added this book to my Want To Read list, it was because it had been named as a \"sci-fi/fantasy classic,\" so I figured I'd check it out. After seeking it out I learned it was but the first of TEN \"Amber Chronicles.\" Originally published in the '70s I could only find it in an anthology which contained all ten stories. \n Not wanting to know too much in advance, I snuck a look at a few reviews and saw \"Nine Princes\" was often the least liked of them all, but I rather liked it. The language and cadence was often strange, almost foreced. The characters were SO greatly exaggerated one might believe them to have been crafted by an elementary school student. These things served to heighten my enjoyment though, not decrease it. \n I hadn't planned to, but because of the way this one ended I'm going to give #2 a try. Not going to commit to anything further than that."}

On the other hand, I didn't like this book because there were a few things that were driving me absolutely crazy."}
{"text": "We always refer to these sorts of books as \"coming of age stories.\" It seems like a rather limited description of a story that combines the magic of childhood with the tragedy that pulls us from that magic into the dire world of adulthood. Mr. McCammon did a beautiful job of dunking us into the magic of childhood and letting it slowly drain away. I was left remembering the magic of childhood and appreciating the feeling that the magic is still there if I could just try a little harder to find it. If you grew up in a neighborhood that was your neighborhood, you knew the streets and the people, but you weren't sure if you knew it all. If you felt the magic of playing in the dark of dream the dreams of possibilities, you should try Boy's Life. Maybe it's time to try to grow up again, but then again maybe not."}
{"text": "The Bone Witch by Rin Chupeco \n Confession: It took me about twenty percent of the novel to figure out what this book was about. That's not a bad thing--it was an exciting challenge. A mysterious bard (name still unknown by the end of the novel) travels to the end of the world where they discover a young woman that wears fancy clothes and kills demons with a word. This is Tea, the infamous Bone Witch, who's a dark asha in exile. For what? We don't know. Tea then tells her story to the bard. \n The Bone Witch is Memoirs of a Geisha meets The Kingkiller Chronicles. Tea manages to be about half as annoying as Kvothe, so that makes the story much more readable, although her mousiness often makes her fade into the background too much as a person. She's a little thin as a character, and this isn't a great thing, considering over half of the story is told from her POV. This disconnect with Tea's personality hampered my ability to get into the story, but that's partly because I had trouble connecting 'current' Tea (exiled and in the boneyard) with 'past' Tea (training as an asha). While I think this tone dissonance might be intentional, it hampered my early enjoyment of the story. Current Tea holds a mystery, but was a character that I couldn't quite grasp. Past Tea is open but a bit boring, a bit bland. This gets better when Tea trains to be an asha, but the early parts of this story were bumpy. \n But there are so many other things about this story the surmount Tea's slightly lackluster personality. Tea discovers her powers when she raises her brother, Fox, from the grave. Fox could've felt flat and like a plot-prop, but he was a wonderfully subtle character. He's reserved but occasionally funny, and there's something subtle in how Chupeco writes him that never quite lets you forget that he's struggling with his new, undead life. The other characters all feel real and fully fleshed out, too. Lady Mykeala is Tea's mentor, and she's dying and weakened without her heart. \n When Tea reaches the Willows, a specific city center dedicated to training asha, the story comes into its own. Asha are witches (kind of) but also geisha (kind of) and elevated court advisors (kind of). The roll of the asha and what they do in and for the societies of this story is complex. Some of the asha are body guards, some marry nobles, and others perform (for lack of a better term) witchcraft. The asha have to be stunningly beautiful yet be capable fighters, dancers, and learned women (yes, only women--but with a twist). How the asha train, who trains them, and all the details thereof are the most interesting elements of this story. It's fantastic worldbuilding, and the magic is upfront yet subtle. \n Current Tea explains and uses much of the magic she'd been taught, which works to show that she's mastered it. Tea also raises deava from the boneyard, which provides a clue as to how the story will end. The deava are at once terrifying and yet adorable. I'm kind of a sucker for scary-yet-cute, so this depiction of the deava worked remarkably for me. It also shows the contrast between how Tea used to view the deava with fear and how she 'now' sees the deava as pets. \n During her training, Tea meets the future king, Kance, and his cousin, Kalen. Tea has clearly captivated the attention of the royal house, and while that plot doesn't play out by the end of this book, it's developed tantalizingly for future story. \n Oh twist ending, how I hated you. It was clear the book might end on a cliff-hanger, which I dreaded. We were teased as to who was in the grave that Tea danced over, and we did find out, but screw you, Rin, for that teaser ending! \n Rating: 4 stars. Loved some of the more subtle character work, and I'm desperately interested in the world that was created. Also, that freaking ending. I need to know how the freak that relationship develops!"}

{"text": "3.5 to 4 stars \n This wasn't a perfect book by all means and not my favorite compared to the previous BDB books so far. I liked the new characters introduced that posed a threat to the Brotherhood and the king. But then the plot was rather anticlimactic at the end. I was waiting for some big blowout or something that'll extend the plot in a major way but it fell rather flat. \n Now to the other storylines... \n Manny and Payne: I love reading about Butch/V/Jane but it was unfair to Manny and Payne as there wasn't that much focus on them. I hadn't liked Manny before but he grew on me. The connection he had with Butch wasn't as surprising since I had already guessed what's what when he said his father used to be a surgeon and had a ways with the ladies . I liked his protective nature, but honestly, what hero isn't protective of his female? Payne didn't seem as kickass as she was when she was on the Other Side. I still liked her character though, she stood up for herself and what she wanted, especially going head to head with a brother like Vishous. \n V/Jane/Butch: I love getting more page time with them! I love Butch for what he did, knowing that it hurt him too. Totally a male of worth. V hasn't really gotten over his traumatic past and his emotions or lack of ability to verbally express his emotions aside from violence drove a wedge in his relationship with Jane. I think I was more invested in V&Jane, which again, felt unfair to Manny & Payne. The thing that confused me most was the part that said V & Jane never got mated... Huh??!??!?! Doesn't V have Jane's name tattooed on his upper back, which is how you tell a Brother is mated?? \n Qhuinn/Blay/Saxton/Layla: \n -It hurts me to see Qhuinn and Blay not talk to each other. Qhuinn finally started to figure himself out and what he wants, even though it may be too little too late. And um hello... his dream/vision? Whaaattt?! That sure threw a wrench into things. \n -I like Saxton. Surprise! I didn't think I would but I do. Even though he knows Blay's true feelings, he's still willing to risk it. He's following his heart and I can't blame him. \n -It'll be interesting to see what develops with Layla considering she's now more outspoken. Am I still rooting for Qhuay? Heck yeah. But I'll have to see how the WARDen works out this storyline. \n Can I skip Tohr's book and go straight to finding out? :P \n What I miss from this book was the non-presence of the rest of the Brothers. There were mentions of names and Wrath and Rhage got a few lines, but other than that, there wasn't enough of them for my liking! I need glimpses into their lives, even a little one, outside of the fighting and training."}
{"text": "While I'm moving this to the \"read\" shelf, the truth is, Goodreads needs a new category: \"Abandoned.\" I can't honestly say why I picked up this book seeing as I really didn't enjoy the first book in the series.

{"text": "The final book in the Harper Connelly series turned out to be my favorite. This one is mostly set in and around Dallas, Texas. Harper and her partner have been called to the area by a wealthy woman who has questions about her grandfather's death. Our heroine has the unique ability to stand on a grave and see the death of the occupant. This also works if Harper can touch a body in a morgue or funeral home or any other place that she finds one. The dead call to Harper and the dead want to be found. This unique ability was a side effect from surviving a lightning strike at the age of 15. In any event, what seems to be a routine job opens up a nasty can of worms. Harper and Tolliver are also using this trip to reconnect with their family members. One of my personal delights in these books was the introduction of side character Manfred Bernardo. Actually, since I read the Midnight, Texas books before starting this series, I was already familiar with the psychic. But I enjoyed seeing him in the early stages of his discovery of the extent of his talent. And since it looks like Manfred will be showing up in a new TV series, perhaps Harper Connelly will also get her Hollywood debut. I hope so."}

{"text": "See full review for The Invasion of the Tearling at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n The Invasion of the Tearling is a countless bunch of tales told in 511 pages. But there are only three tales that you really need to pay attention to. First, there's Queen Kelsea of the Tearling. Despite everything that she has accomplished since book 1 her throne is still threatened. Not only by the Red Queen, but by people who desperately want her off the throne for the good of the kingdom including the wonderful Holy Father of the Arvath. While dealing with coups she also has to deal with the Mortemsene army that is amassing on her border and looks to invade all because she refuses to send the shipment of slaves that was promised in the treaty her mother signed. The Tearling has no chance of winning and Kelsea knows that but that still doesn't stop her from hoping. Especially when a dark stranger shows up at her fireplace one night and tells her that he can help her. But like with everything, his help comes with a price and she isn't sure she wants to pay it. \n So, in my review for book 1 I said that the reason I didn't like the book was because it was really slow and I wasn't sure if I was going to continue on. I bit the bullet and continued on and my complaint for book 1 still stands with book 2, BUT this book was more enjoyable than the first."}
{"text": "Well well well, Cassandra Clare. You really are quite good at what you do, aren't you? \n Big buzz around these books, right? I mean there are... five out so far? Six? Many more coming in the future? Steve has already read them and really liked them, and after Heidi gifted them to me in ebook form, I still waited a bit - I didn't want to be disappointed. I finally took the plunge and am happy I did. \n The fantasy/paranormal world is twisted together with the normal world in such a way that I did not feel overwhelmed. Each piece of the Mortal Instruments puzzle is introduced and woven together until you're at the end of the book, flipping pages as fast as you can, and understanding much more about Clary, Jace, and the Shadowhunters than you ever thought you would. \n I really think this is a series that most any reader would like. If I liked it and Steve liked it, it shows that it appeals to quite a large audience - boys and girls, fantasy/science fiction lovers and those who prefer contemporary. I will certainly be continuing the journey with the remainder of these books!"}
{"text": "See full review for Half Bad at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n This book follows the tale of Nathan Bryn, a half White Witch (WW) and a half Black Witch (BW). His father - where he gets the half BW from - is actually the most notorious Black Witch in the world. He's a murderer and the Council of witches is punishing Nathan for his parental heritage. His half-sister Jessica hates him. His mother kills herself because of him. He can't have contact with white witches without prior approval from the Council and later on he can't go anywhere without prior approval from the Council either. But Nathan doesn't like to follow the rules, he doesn't like how much the Council is controlling his life so he goes where he wants to and hangs out with whom he wants to. The person he likes to hang out most with is a girl named Annalise O'Brien who turns out to be the niece of a member on the Council and who has three older brothers who don't like Nathan at all. \n Eventually his rebellious nature lands him deep in trouble and he is captured and imprisoned by the Council for almost two years. While there he learns pieces of the truth for why the Council has been so interested in him. There was a prophecy that foretold that Marcus - Nathan's father - could be defeated with help from a dagger named Fairborn and Nathan himself. Nathan doesn't want to help the Council, but they are the only people who can give him the three Gifts on his seventeenth birthday that will help him come into his own powers. What can he do?"}

I know that reading Lackey for the plot is like reading Playboy for the articles, and yet. Ouch."}
{"text": "When I first cracked open Breaking Dawn, I was a starry-eyed reader with preset visions of how this story should go. Needless to say, once we hit the pregnancy from hell, then the Imprinting of WTF?, followed by the \"oh, come on, what a cop-out it is to have Bella totally in control!\" I was so done, I chucked it across the room and quit the entire franchise. \n I'm older, wiser, and more cynical now, along with having two films based off this stinker of a book under my belt, which means my read-through had two objectives: it calmed my raging fury in some places, and increased my general sense of \"no freakin' way\" in others. \n The Good: \n The wedding and early chapters are brilliant. Kate is wonderful, as is Garrett (although my fondness for him has more to do with Lee Pace on screen than his character on the page). I even got to where I liked \"Nessie\" after awhile (... once she stopped cracking her mother's bones from the inside out, that is). And, we get another visitation with Aro (shame it's so... dull) and his pet psychopath, Jane. Being inside Jacob's head was also amusing I don't mind the whole \"vampire pregnancy\" thing anymore (initially, I hated it) but... I'm annoyed how the author went about it. \n The Bad: \n Doesn't the author understand the creepy overtones of some of this stuff? Jacob imprinting on a baby, in spite of all the written assurances that it's \"not like that,\" and \"they're just friends\" is freaking NUTS, and not just because it reminds me of \"child-grooming.\" Don't even get me started on the minute this book turned from a romantic YA to a horror film, complete with Edward ripping his child out of Bella's abdomen with his teeth. My first time through I was screaming \"Kill that thing!\" (and I'm pro-life... that's how bad it was) and this time, I just set my jaw and read on. She uses way too many words, particularly at the end, where the most \"exciting\" thing about the Volturi confrontation is Bella internalizing her thoughts about how awesome her shield is, as she protects everyone around her from... talking. That's it. You get to the freaking climax of the book, and everyone stands in a circle and talks... for like 40 pages. \n Thank you, whomever brought this scene to the big screen and CHANGED IT. This book would have been ten thousand times more awesome if Meyer had WRITTEN INTO IT what happens on screen - character deaths, full on action, then yanked the rug out from under our feet. You single-handedly turned the biggest snore-fest in the franchise into the most awesome on-screen confrontation. You deserve applause. \n Also, since I got bored (again) toward the end, I did a lot of skim-reading. I don't have the burning hatred for this book that I used to, but it's still something of a disappointment given how fun the first three are to read."}

{"text": "See full review for Up from the Grave at: http://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.w... \n It's actually been quiet over the last few months for Cat and Bones. But all of that is about to change when Cat's uncle Don shows up and tells them that he's worried about Cat's old team. They haven't been to their homes in three weeks. Concerned, Cat goes back to the place she thought she'd never go again, to her old team's compound to talk to Madigan. He tells them cheerfully that every member from her old team is dead and that if he sees either of them again, he'll have them killed on the spot. \n Not convinced of her friend's deaths, Cat and Bones talk to Don, but he is STILL hiding how Madigan and him know each other and every time they summon him to ask, he leaves. With help from the Ghoul Queen of Louisiana Marie, they get him to stay and spill his secrets. Before Don got to know Cat, they only hired her because of her weird geneology. They were taking her blood and other fluids and not only testing it but implementing it into test subjects as well. The results were miraculous, and Madigan wanted to breed Cat, but Don wouldn't allow it and had him fired. But that didn't stop Madigan from continuing on with his experiments. So Cat does the unexpected and tries to draw Madigan out by proposing a meeting between the two of them. It doesn't go how she plans."}
{"text": "The Grisha series laid a very good foundation which would've been amazing to explore, but it never dared to, it just skimmed the surface to pass on to something else. One concept which I found extremely good was the lack of God: only Saints are worshipped in Ravka. That's a lot. That's humanist. If there is no God to answer to, no God to test you, every human can be a Saint. It would be great to explore, the concept that without a God you can aim even higher. But sadly, none of this is ever explained. The whole tsarpunk aesthetic is just an aesthetic 95% of the time. I wish Leigh Bardugo had been braver, I wish she'd gone into the light/darkness duality, the humanizing/dehumanizing effect of eternity, the real meaning of a name, the meaning of power. The hunger for power, oh my God, I wish we'd gone down that road. \n Instead what we got with this third act is the frankly terrible moral that if you are strong, if you feel good in your strength as woman, if you are powerful, well... you really should turn all of that down for some boy's love, because he's scared of you when you're powerful. The moral is: make yourself little and take up no space, because a boy wants to be more powerful than you. Alina didn't have space to embrace herself because what she wanted was to please Mal, and that is disgusting."}
{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n I received this book via Read it and Reap from the Shut Up and Read group. \n This book did start out with a lot of promise, I loved the first page and the scene setting of the sin collectors. The story centres around a sin collector called Liliana who is trying to lead a normal life even though she clearly isn't normal. She meets a guy from her past and all of a sudden strange things start to happen. \n It would have been cool to have some more information about the sin collectors but seeing as this is book one in a series it might be saved for later. \n There were a few issues which I note have come up with other reviews, I must admit I was a little relieved that other people picked up on it as I thought it was just me. I thought it was a little bit creepy that Liliana and Olexander ended up together at the end. I'd pictured him as someone who had been her Guardian while she was a child and to have them together at the end just felt a bit wrong. Had he been her Guardian when she was a teenager then it might have been a bit different, but he saw her growing up! Perhaps if there had been a bit of backstory about the collectors and how they lived this might have worked out differently, but seeing as no adult collectors could have lived together before without the ritual then it still seems odd. \n Another issue was that I thought Liliana would be a little bit more worldly wise being alive for over a hundred years. At times she seemed wise but at other times she seemed dreadfully naive. Her relationship with William/Billy seemed a perfect example of this. Was she naive? Had she had relationships before? How had they gone? I was disappointed with how the relationship developed and given that ***massive spoiler alert*** Billy dies then it seems sad that he couldn't have reprieved himself at the end by sacrificing himself to save Liliana or Julia, or hell, even Valentine or Olexander. \n Overall I really liked the concept. In some places the writing was excellent and in other places I wished the backstory could have been emphasised a bit more. I feel really bad giving it two stars but I really didn't like the ending as I've explained above."}

{"text": "Review originally posted on journeyintotheshelves.tumblr.com \n **I received an eARC of this book courtesy of NetGalley and Disney-Hyperion. This has had no bearing on this review. \n A Thousand Nights is a retelling of the Arabian folktale classic One Thousand and One Nights. It follows the story of a girl who sacrifices herself to a murderous king, Lo-Melkhiin, in order to save her sister. She ventures away from home to his palace, marries him, and expects to be dead by dawn just like the 300 wives before her. The sun rises the next morning, and she's alive and she's determined to stay that way. A story of faith, perseverance, and just a touch of magic, E.K. Johnston weaves a magical story about survival and the bond between sisters. \n This was one of my top anticipated books of 2015 - I mean, the cover alone is gorgeous, but the synopsis sold me - and I was so thrilled when I was emailed saying that I got an eARC. Though, because I had such high expectations for this book, I was slightly let down (most likely because I built it up so much in my mind that it couldn't live up to the expectations). \n The main problem I had with this book was with the plot. It took me a while to find it, actually, and it didn't really begin to show itself until about a third of the way of the novel. There wasn't any real action build in the beginning. The plot did being to build, however, toward the later half of the book, and began to really develop toward the end of the novel. The same goes with the action of A Thousand Nights. I just wanted it a bit longer since it began to develop so late, or for the action to begin just a bit sooner. \n Though, this doesn't mean I disliked the plot entirely. There were certain moments in the novel that were fascinating to read. For example, there is magic in this story (of course; it's a fantasy novel), but I didn't realize how much of it was real until about halfway through (which I think was the point; adds a bit of mystery). The magic that both characters wield and what is done with this magic, and how it is created and used was imaginative and different from what I've read in other books previously. \n However, E.K. Johnston's writing style is what made this book. I really enjoyed the way she told this story. It was simply beautiful. The way she wrote this story felt more like she was sitting around a campfire or telling the story to children before bed, rather than something that was written down on paper. It had a spoken elegance to it that really ensnares the reader and drives them to read farther. It was masterfully scripted story, so, if anything, the book is worth reading just for her storytelling capabilities alone. \n The characters in this book were fairly basic. The reader never discovers anyone's name - even the narrator's, with the exception of the king, Lo-Melkhiin. This was slightly frustrating in the beginning to read it that way because it became repetitive and a nuisance to continually refer to people as \"my father's father's father\" over and over again. However, I can see why Johnston decided to write the novel in this manner. This method coincides with the \"campfire storytelling\" writing style Johnston has and it really brings the reader into the novel. Because there isn't a definitive name for the main character or her family members, the reader can insert themselves into the book and become the main character (which sort of counteracts the lackluster qualities of the plot to make the reader want to continue). It is told in the first person point of view (except for certain parts which were, actually, very fun and interesting to read because it gave you a peek into the mind of Lo-Melkhiin), and this furthers the self-insertion idea. \n Overall, A Thousand Nights by E.K. Johnston is a beautifully written standalone retelling of One Thousand and One Nights about a girl who gives up everything to save her sister."}
{"text": "Mmhh I was a bit disappointed about this sequel. The first book was soo good but this one, not so much. It was a long read because nothing really happened until the end. The suspense and tension was missing and the spark between Lexia and Linc was not as good as in book 1. \n I was hoping for lots of ass kicking, action filled scenes but no such luck. They were present but fell kind of short. It was a constantly back and forth between Lexia and Linc declaring their love and what the mating really means; her inner conflict about being a Hunter but being different than the rest - I got bored to be honest. \n The grammar errors in the book through my reading off big times and it annoyed me, especially because I bought the copy and it wasn't an arc. It needed s second or even 3rd read through. Plus, some scenes made no sense, ie: Linc was in his panther form adn could talk?? Seriously, no. not when you write the sentence before he was still in his animal form and didn't transform back to human. \n I had high expectations for this one but it seemed as if the author was dragging it out so she can write a 3rd book. Lexia's personality changed towards the end it made no sense and even though I was able to read the 1st Ch of book 3, I decided I won't read the 3rd book because I'm somewhat done with this series. \n I feel bad for Linc, my fave panther, and I don't understand why Lexia didn't snap her mother's neck...but oh well, maybe you'll think differently when reading certain scenes. \n Pls don't think just because I didn't love it that you won't, I just had bigger hopes and expectations for the sequel of 'Lexia, the Deadwood Hunter'."}
{"text": "Quando la sinossi fa promesse da politico! \n Ecco il punto: il libro scorre abbastanza velocemente, lo stile e povero di descrizioni, e i protagonisti sembrano tutti sotto l'effetto di uno slow- motion. Anche se la trama non e malaccio, a mio avviso, poteva essere sviluppata meglio. \n Lo stile di Theo Lawrence e un po' troppo \"fanciullesco o Young\" chiamiamolo come vogliamo, ma e proprio questo il mio problema! \n Avrei voluto una maggiore dinamicita per raccontare i fatti salienti, piu dettagli per descrivere luoghi, e l'introspezione psicologica dei personaggi curata in maniera migliore. \n Invece fatti e situazioni vengono narrati a singhiozzo, alternando ricordi sbiaditi alla vita reale; con una sequenza che spesso crea confusione durante la lettura. \n Protagonisti e antagonisti uniti sotto un comune denominatore: le bugie. Tutti nascondono qualcosa o qualcuno. Questo potrebbe sembrare affascinante, non lo nascondo, ma il modo di svelare il tutto lascia alquanto a desiderare. \n Un libro di per se carino e leggero ma ha diverse pecche.

{"text": "**I received an eARC of this book courtesy of NetGalley and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. This has had no bearing on this review. \n A loose retelling of Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities, Sarah Rees Brennan's Tell the Wind and Fire follows Lucie Manette a girl born in the Dark half of this fantastical version of New York City, and manages to escape to the Light. With her escape, she becomes a celebrity in both the Light and the Dark, for two different reasons, but Lucie just wants to live a normal life. But her boyfriend has a dark secret of his own that pulls her back into the center of a deep power struggle between the Dark and the Light where she may not be able to save everyone. \n Unfortunately, Tell the Wind and Fire was mildly underwhelming for me. It wasn't a bad read, however it wasn't as enjoyable as I expected it to be based on past works of Brennan's that I've read. I always love stories about divided cities, but this one just didn't capture me. The plot, like the city, was divided. There were aspects that were rich and well developed - Lucie's past, for example - while others, some even pivotal to the progression of the story, were not. This just made the entire novel seem disjointed, rushed, and jumpy all the way to the end. \n The characters themselves also suffered from this underdevelopment. While Lucie's former life is a key aspect of both her character and the plot, it seemed as if it was the only thing worth mentioning. This caused her character arc to feel rushed. Brennan's other characters, namely Ethan and Carwyn, also suffered from this underdevelopment. So much so that, when their character arcs \"complete,\" it just simply felt out of character for both. I wanted more development, especially when it came to Carwyn's character who added a bit of personality and comedy to the story. \n The writing throughout the novel seemed just as disjointed as the plot. At times, it felt like she was trying too hard to imitate Dickens' style, which made the story and flow feel awkward. The worst of it, in my opinion, was chapter three which was an entire chapter dedicated to world building. In essence, a chapter solely dedicated as an info dump. It shattered any kind of pace Brennan was building and, actually, confused me more than it helped. \n The saving grace of this novel were the last couple of chapters. They were interesting, coherent, and fast paced. If Brennan made the entire book like those few chapters, it would have been a hit. Unfortunately, that just isn't the case and Tell the Wind and Fire is a miss for me."}

{"text": "My original review was written for Joyfully Jay reviews and can be accessed here. \n Edward Grey is a Canadian medical student who is also a necromancer. He has known his ability to reanimate the dead for most of his life, since he raised his cat Boo. Over the years, he has learned a lot about caring for zombies and is mentored by a vudou woman, Mariel, who also can raise the dead. \n Walking through the park one evening, Edward encounters a recently killed young man. It seems the man was a victim of violence, based on his injuries. Instead of summoning the police, Edward elects to bring the young man to his home, where he reanimates him. Wanting to avoid triggering any past memories and possibly enrage his newest zombie, Edward hides the man's identification and calls him \"Kit.\" \n Kit is understandably upset about his new situation, and-at first-suspects Edward as his killer. Kit, for his part, is a sentient zombie, with emotions and desires. He wants to continue his schooling and go shopping and have a life, even if it is undead. Over time, they develop a tentative friendship, but Edward is increasingly attracted to Kit. Kit is far more stylish and engaging than shy-mouse Edward. Edward often questions whom is the zombie in this partnership. \n I liked this story, but it was a little long on Edward mooning. The pace was slower than I generally prefer, occasionally dragging and with a lot of angst on Edward's part. He's afraid of Kit, afraid Kit will turn on him, afraid Kit will leave him, and afraid Kit will lose control and go \"Zombie eat brains!!!\" But, most of all, Edward is afraid to confess his attraction and have suave, stylish, zombie Kit reject him. \n The last third of the book introduces the vengeance aspect of the story, and that got pretty interesting. I found the romance to be subtle and a low simmer. When Edward and Kit do get together, it is tentative at first. Then, of course Edward has to agonize about how Kit won't age while Edward will. Or, if Kit only likes him because they live together. Edward is the kind of guy who borrows trouble. \n The book is rather sedate until Kit meets a \"stranger\" and remembers bits of his old life, in particular the last night of it. We get Kit's insight then, funneled through his memories that break through into Edward's mind. Edward tracks Kit's path of gore, which takes them both to the edge of destruction. The end is peaceful and hopeful with all secrets being revealed. There is no cliffhanger and the HEA is sweet."}
{"text": "After reading and loving Shadow and Bone by Leigh Bardugo, the first book in the very hyped Grisha-trilogy, I felt like starting another hyped Young Adult series. Mostly because I had to wait two weeks for Siege And Storm and Ruin And Rising (the second and third book in the Grisha series) to come in, but also because I was so blown away by myself that I hadn't started this awesome series sooner. The same could be happening with other series! The Lunar Chronicles series by Marissa Meyer sounds quite awesome, the books have beautiful covers and the first book, Cinder, has an average rating of 4.13 stars. Like what the heck, I needed to get on this! \n \"Even in the Future the Story Begins with Once Upon a Time.\" \n All the books in the Lunar Chronicles series are based on fairy tales. Cinder is based on Cinderella and stars a cyborg who works as a mechanic in New Beijing. She lives with her stepmother and two stepsisters, of which two treat her very poorly. Unfortunately there is no way to leave them. New Beijing is haunted by an awful and deadly disease, with no available cure. But then Cinder meets prince Kai and everything changes. \n \"Vanity is a factor, but it is more a question of control. It is easier to trick others into perceiving you as beautiful if you can convince yourself you are beautiful. But mirrors have an uncanny way of telling the truth.\" \n If you followed my updates while reading this book, it's quite obvious what I thought of it. Although I just realized that my star-rating might give something away as well. I disliked it a lot. The story wasn't gripping, the world wasn't really built (even though the fact that it's in New Beijing has so much potential), stepmother Adri and stepsister Pearl were extremely annoying and Cinder was quite annoying as well sometimes. Especially these last two things were awful to me. I understand that Adri and Pearl were supposed to be annoying, but the scenes with them were so long and detailed, it just got to me. In addition, Cinder was so sensitive. She lived with these witches for ages, so you would think she would have toughened up a bit. Yet she let everything they said get to her. Grow some balls, jeez! And all the emotional and exaggerated thoughts Cinder had about being a cyborg. Pffew. \n Nope, this book was not for me. It might be the fact that it was \"too young\" for me, even though I normally don't have a problem with that while reading Young Adult. I might continue the series in the future; I already have Scarlet and Cress on my iPad and I'm curious how the characters will intertwine throughout the books. But I'm not sure. Right now, I don't really feel like it."}

{"text": "Legion \n written by Brandon Sanderson \n read by Oliver Wyman \n Legion is a short, interesting, 2-disc novella by Brandon Sanderson about a man with a unique mental disorder that allows him to do extraordinary things. Sanderson develops some fun characters, interesting abilities (of course this is typical for him), and drops them in a mysterious adventure. My only real complaint about this novella is that I wish there was more. \n Those familiar with Sanderson's style know to expect a unique magic/ability system that leads to an interesting plot. In this case, Stephen Leeds has many hallucinations that all serve as experts in some way that is useful to him such as weapons, knowledge, psychology, etc. People come to Stephen with problems and he can serve as a team of experts to solve whatever case/mystery needed. The trick is that only he can see these hallucinations (think A Beautiful Mind) which can lead to some interesting conversations. \n Oliver Wyman does a great job narrating this novella. He did a great job with all the voices and accents from the novella. He does a great vocal equivalent of a skeptical look when characters are dealing with someone talking to hallucinations. I would listen to books narrated by Oliver Wyman again."}
{"text": "This book was AMAZING! I mean, where do I even start with this?! The writing was fantastic from start to finish, keeping me intrigued from the very beginning. VE Schwab is a fantasy-writing GENIUS; this is hands-down one of the best fantasy novels I have ever read. How is that she was able to perfectly weave stories together that seemed minor at first, but come to have such importance later on? The characters were SO well-developed, I enjoyed reading about each and every one of them! Even the evil sibling royals Astrid and Athos of White London! I am absolutely in love with Kell and how strong he is and how deep his love for his brother Rhy is. Lila is also now one of my favourite females characters. She is sassy, strong and takes no prisoners. She is a force to be reckoned with and I LOVE HER! \n I loved travelling through the different Londons with Kell and being kept on the edge of my seat as one thing after another kept happening. I felt as though for the first half of the book, I was holding my breath because I could almost feel the air of danger just around the corner. One minute everything is semi-fine and then BOOM something crazy happens and I'm literally shouting \"WHAT IS GOING ON\" as I'm reading! \n I love it when books take me on an emotional rollercoaster! I feel like it's been a long time since I've had a book completely take over my life and consume my thoughts and I'm so happy this book did. I haven't read a fantasy novel in a while (seeing as I've been stuck in a contemporary YA phase the last few months) and this book has definitely gotten me back into the genre. How will I ever be able to read other fantasy series when Schwab's books are JUST SO GOOD?!

Absolutely not. But is it a fast-moving thinking reader's adventure? It sure as shit is. \n I wouldn't normally give a book like this a five-star rating--a book with a couple of big problem areas (frequently corny dialogue in the form of Watney's first person log entries; some point-of-view liberties taken by Weir)--but it's just SO MUCH FUN. \n The corny dialogue is much easier to deal with in the audiobook medium. The narrator, R.C. Bray, embodies this stranded astronaut using the log entries as his only conversation with the outside world. Bray also does a good job with an international cast of characters, although I could have done without the Mexican-American accent for Martinez and the vaguely Chinese accent for Ng--these felt totally unnecessary and walk a fine line between character-specific and racist. \n But as a whole package, Weir's got an exciting story, great sense of pace, and a terrific grasp of the science. And it's SO MUCH FUN."}
{"text": "I enjoyed the first two books in this series - unfortunately it was difficult with the hard copies, and no web access at the time, to figure out which was book 1 so I read The Smoke Thief first :-(.

The magic is interesting while easy to understand with the dragons being able to shapeshift and having various unique Gifts. I was confused about the dream aspect of the plot and what it meant, which was likely intended by the author but not essential to the plot...or may have been a result of reading the first two books out of order. \n I really liked the community of characters I met in both books and the world this author created so I want to pursue the rest of this series, in proper order this time, and see how things work out for everyone."}

{"text": "Silent Echo: A Siren's Tale is quite an interesting read. You meet a likeable character named Portia. She appears to be an ordinary teenager in that she's dealing with being shy, insecure, wanting badly to fit in and is angry at her parents. Portia though is dealing with more than most teens as she has no voice. Thankfully she has made friends but that's where it gets complicated for her, when she has a crush on a new guy, a friend decides that maybe he has feelings for her as well. So things seem like normal teenage stuff but as you read this story there is this underlying, intriguing thread of something dark lurking there. \n Right at the beginning you're introduced to some birds acting rather oddly, so it makes you wonder what's going on. Slowly things start to unfold and you get this crossover of ancient legend with current day life. Strange things start to happen and Portia's world changes drastically. Some bad things occur that Portia wants to stop only it seems that she might be the problem. She learns a truth about herself that shocks her but explains a lot about what is going on. Now she has to figure out how to take control of it or ancient forces will use her gift and her for their quest for revenge. \n I liked Portia, I wanted her to get her voice, to get the cute new boy, to keep her current friends but there are a lot of things working against her. She's a really caring, likeable person that even when she's doing some not so nice stuff, you really want her to figure a way out of it. \n It's a good read that has an interesting mix of reality, fantasy and of the past and present. I like how the author brought Greek Mythology into this and used ancient mythology to blend with today for the rebirth of new life. It's definitely worth reading. I was given a copy as part of a book tour."}

{"text": "I had this book ready to read right after reading the first, and that is exactly what I did. I was fairly excited to get to reading about the characters again, too. \n I don't have as much to say about this one compared to the first, except for a few things - one, I didn't like being 'clued in' on what was happening almost 100 pages into the book (all of those \"this is why this is happening\" paragraphs in case the reader forgot from book one). That's probably because I had just read book one, but it started to get very monotonous and I had to skip over many parts. Two, the title of the book didn't make much sense to me except that it described their weather situation - there wasn't much to do with snow or ice or anything, unless I missed some reference. Who knows, I read it pretty quickly. \n A solid second book, it hooked me right into reading the third (which I'm doing now). I'm very glad that the characters are doing seemingly sane things with their relationships and that it's not one of those stories that breaks people apart/does other drastic things to try to keep you reading (reminds me of Grey's Anatomy and Meredith/Derek for the first few seasons)! \n Oh, and I still don't really like the book cover, and I don't know who those people are supposed to be. \n Book Cover: 0/10 \n Book Title: 5/10 \n Plot: 9/10 \n Characters: 9/10 \n Ending: 9/10 \n Overall: 8/10"}

{"text": "Actual Rating: 4.5 \n Wow. This book was really good. Not my usual read, but damnit. Ness is a damned good story teller. I kept wanting to know more and more what would happen even in the back of my mind I already knew (much like Connor). It made my heart ache, but unfortunately I didn't cry (even though I wanted to). This story is told so beautifully and I got through it with decent time as well. It's both slow-burning and fast-paced. Contradictory. Much like human nature (as said by the Monster). Very powerful story about grief, loss, and acceptance."}
{"text": "This is like a Muppet Babies version of Game of Thrones. I dug it a lot. As the title suggests, four of the five main characters are bastard offspring of royalty who are on the run from murderous mercenaries and from a war their traitorous relatives are trying to start. The characters are tropes straight out of central casting but I liked their rapport and their back stories enough not to mind they weren't original. You have Jax the stable boy, Miles the stuffy book worm, Zell the taciturn warrior whose hard outer shell masks his nobility and kindness, Lyriana the crunchy, touchy feely, do gooder type, and Tilla your narrator who is struggling with insecurities borne of her lowly station. They are different enough from each other that there are opportunities for friction, but they also have the common experience of being outcasts and their shared trials to bond them together. \n This book is quite dark. There is a lot of gore and violence, and there's plenty of pain in the character's past and present. This dark material is written powerfully and sensitively, and intercut with some understated humor that works without seeming out of place. \n Also, I can't believe I'm typing this, but the obligatory sort of love triangle, which typically drives me bonkers in stories like this, is actually compelling. It doesn't dominate the story thankfully but what's there is good. Tilla is hot for Zell because he's brooding and tortured and hot. He reciprocates those feelings but he has very understandable intimacy issues. Miles has pined for Tilla his whole life but she's just not into him. Each character behaves in an interesting, plausible way, it ties nicely into the resolution of the plot, and Shvartz really nails the dark side of male entitlement. \n This book isn't seeking to reinvent the wheel but Shvartz writes well enough that he can make even shop worn conventions of the genre feel interesting. I read this in one sitting and enjoyed it a lot."}
{"text": "I truly regret to say this, but I didn't enjoy this book. It didnt pick up for me till the middle of chapter 8, and then it fell short towards the end. So much happens, but it all connects in such a lazy and half-finished way, leaving me angry that anything had happened at all. \n I think the problem is that I fell in love with American Gods, and I thought this book would be similar. It wasn't. The other problem is that I absolutely love Shadow, but Fat Charlie is such a flat and boring character in comparison. In fact, the only character I actually liked was Mrs. Noah."}

{"text": "Cool teenage magic romance with time travel, please don't be asking for miracles and don't touch anything else by Ms Curley! \n \"Old Magic\" was for me the fanfic before the fanfic, it has two teens forced to timetravel to the past and be fake married to discover how the curse placed upon one of them came to their family. It pretty much had me at pretend to be married, so totally self-indulgent pleasure for 15 year old me, to the point I made sure to re-acquire the book when I lost the first copy."}

These books showed me that there was more to life than, well, books. I really identified with Hermione, though for some reason I never thought she was British.

{"text": "This clever fantasy was an engaging Kindergarten read aloud. The medieval setting, mysterious adventure, placid young hero and compelling search for delicious made for a wonderful read to which we were eager to return. \n Like all good fiction, there is a lot going on here. Opportunities abound for a discussion of words, fantasy, truth and fiction, greed, loyalty, persistence and mystery. Magic does make appearances, but it's not a new age find-it-in-yourself type of thing - it's a separate world of woldwellers, dwarfs, and mermaids who don't desire to get involved in the things of men, and the tale of how men seek to induce them to use their gifts to their advantage. \n An excellent read. Highly recommended."}

It's not something I'm upset or embarrassed about anymore.) \n I really do wish that some of the side characters were a little more developed. I do understand that most of the story revolved around the couple, but the side characters were so great and I just wanted more of them! \n Regardless, I loved this and The Rose and the Dagger is officially one of my most anticipated books of 2016! \n PS: I might edit/add to this later.

{"text": "3.5 stars \n Read for URR Halloween challenge- werewolf category. \n I keep telling myself that these books are awful. That I really need to stop reading them. I keep telling myself that this one is the last I'm going to read. Well, guess what? \n These books really aren't that great, but they're fucking adorable and so much fun to read. I have made peace with the fact that I love these books and plan to read all of them, quality be-damned. They make me happy. \n Moving on. \n This is Colton's book. He's a wolf shifter and he's been dreaming of his mate, Rheia. She happens to have an adopted four-year-old daughter, Penny, but Colton doesn't know that yet. Rheia has also been dreaming of her mate but she doesn't really know it because she's human. When Rheia and her daughter are attacked, her paranormal friends (who she sees as her brothers) tell her to make her way to the Alpha estate in Lycaonia and when she arrives, she meets Colton for the first time. Colton is relieved to finally have found his mate but is surprised to find out he's now a dad. Everyone at the Alpha estate immediately falls in love with Penny, his new daughter. From there the book is mostly about Colton trying to get Rheia to accept him as a mate and learning to be a father to a very traumatized four-year-old girl who hasn't spoken since she witnessed her parents attack and murder. Of course, everyone is still trying to find out what the Ferals want and why the hell they feel the need to murder people, especially pregnant paranormal women. \n Rheia and Colton were a bit boring as a couple. I liked that Rheia spent most of the book refusing to accept Colton as her mate because it was a little more realistic, especially for a human. Shifters/vampires/witches etc..are used to the idea of mates. Humans, not so much. There was nothing wrong with Colton and Rheia as a couple, there just wasn't anything spectacular about them either. He was gorgeous, kind, and funny. She was smart, strong, and beautiful. You know, the normal stuff. They were certainly compatible in bed, though. Very compatible. Dayum. \n Honestly, the best part of these books is the ever-growing list of secondary characters. I look forward to their part of the plot and checking in on them. In fact, now that I think about it, the main characters are usually my least favorite part of the books. Somehow it still manages to work. \n The plot is often ridiculous, they are filled with absurd instaloves, and there were a few grammatical errors but for some reason, I just didn't care. This series is hilarious and I always laugh out loud. Several times. These books don't take themselves too seriously and they are a great escape. Award-winning literature? I think not. But I'm not going to let that bother me. \n And yes, of course, I'm going to keep reading the series."}

Having been introduced to the intelligence of ravens, I was intrigued to hear of a book told from the raven's perspective. \n The plot was well paced: I was always interested in what would happen next. Information was delayed long enough to maintain suspense without losing interest. Most of the characters were likable (one had no redeeming qualities, however). There was some apparent anthropomorphism in the thoughts and actions, especially in the young adolescent lover ravens. (I have yet to read The Mind of the Raven; maybe when I do I will change my mind.) There was room for a lot of nonintrusive instruction about the ways of nature as Colin, the crow who had lost his memory, was reintroduced to raven ways, observed other animals,and met and conversed with yet others. \n There was a delightful mythic quality woven here and there as well, including a creation story from the raven's perspective."}
{"text": "See full review for Deadlocked at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n All right, this is the penultimate book in the Sookie Stackhouse series, where major plot lines should start coming together, ultimatums are thrown out, and some major villain comes to the fold. Right? Wrong. Sure, some plot lines start to come to a happy conclusion, but I have way more questions than answers. But I'm jumping ahead of myself. Sookie has survived a lot over the years, ever since Bill Compton walked into Merlotte's one evening. But this might be her hardest test yet. Felipe - the King of Louisiana - is back in town researching the mysterious disappearance of his regent Victor. Eric is called into his presence to atone for what may or may not have happened to the vamp. Sookie - being Eric's wife - is indebted to make an appearance. \n But while at this party, things go wrong, and they go wrong fast. It starts with getting a call from Eric's day guy that she doesn't need to be at the party that early she can come an hour later, then Bill, who's put in charge of security, warning her as she pulls up that she should just go home. It gets worse when she comes inside and is escorted by Pam to see Eric, and they come upon him feeding on another woman. Sookie is pissed. Eric is confused because unlike with other women, he couldn't resist her. And Felipe chooses this moment to summon Eric and Sookie to speak with him. While they're talking to the King, the police show up. The girl who Eric had been feeding on is dead on his front lawn. \n Okay. I really don't know what to make of this book. Sure, as a standalone novel, it was entertaining, but as the second to last book in a series, it sort of fell flat."}

Credited to Charles Perrault are versions of some the most famous fairy tales known today, such as Cinderella and Little Red Riding Hood, and I love how magical and shocking they are here. \n This collection is split in to two parts, the first part is a selection of tales told in verse where the second part is prose. Personally I preferred the latter half, since those stories were more familiar to me and it was interesting to see how the original tales influenced later versions. However, Perrault's poetry is equally clever and just as dark. \n In the Oxford World Classics edition there's also some illustrations scattered throughout which is a nice little touch."}

{"text": "There's not enough truly humorous fantasy in this world. There's so much grim dark, but I love absurdism--and does this story ever deliver. I'm going to review each of the four books in the main series arc separately, even though I read them in a box set. \n Critical Failures isn't an original plot--D&D...wait, C&C...nerds get transported into their game world by a dick of a dungeon master, Mordred. They literally become their characters. Tim is a halfling thief, Dave a dwarf cleric, Julian an elven wizard/sorcerer, and Cooper a half-orc barbarian. Later in the book, Tim's sister, Katherine, and her date-but-not-boyfriend, Chase, are transported to the C&C world as well. Katherin is a half-elf druid, and Chase is...a bard. Because someone has to be. \n I've never read a sword and sorcery fantasy with so many dick jokes and fart jokes. It's amazing. The adult humor makes some of the subtle character moments--I promise that they're there--work well instead of making them feel cheesy. This plot flies on wings of audacity, which makes the cliche avalanche feel fresh and new. For example, healing magic is painful at first--and then you orgasm. Or shit yourself, if you're Cooper. \n Magic healing--painful yet relaxing. \n The main antagonist is Mordred, who manipulates the C&C world to dick with Tim & Co. Tim is kidnapped by Captain Righteous, whose name is hilarious, but he ends up being a weirdly interesting character. Same with Shorty the gnome prison guard. That's the genius of this book, really. It gives a sweet, sweet nerd fix while playing with elements of character and making everything that can feel...well, cheesy...about D&D feel fresh and real. It's kind of hilarious to me that so much *bad* fantasy has been inspired by D&D, and yet, this D&D fanfic/love letter feels new and fresh. \n Maybe it's the swearing. Maybe it's because that this story captures the heart of playing D&D with your stoned friends. Not that yours truly has ever done that. *ahem* \n This is clearly going to be a long series, so the ending isn't resolved. It's satisfying, but I went into the end knowing this series continued. The main 'kick-off' arc with Mordred has a satisfying twist that allows the gang to tango out of immediate danger, but for a steep price. The characters remain in the C&C world--good for us, bad for them. \n The number of dick jokes won't disappoint. \n Rating: 5 stars I dare you not to laugh. \n Blog link: https://hdlynn.wordpress.com/2016/08/..."}

{"text": "3.5 stars, the first half of the book set up the story and it kind of dragged but the second part of the book is where the story shines, especially when other characters besides Victor and Eli are introduced. Seriously, the supporting cast was what saved this book. I love Sydney, Mitch, and Serena. I don't really think \"superhero\" is a good word to use when describing this book in any way but I see how it plays into Eli's character. I do like how neither Victor nor Eli can be categorically placed into \"good\" vs \"bad\" or \"hero\" vs \"villan\" (which is definitely one of the themes the author was trying to get across with this book) yet the reader still somehow comes to pick a side and root for that character as if he were the hero (which I guess, in terms of this story, he is). The concept of ExtraOrdinary people and their powers is really interesting, I especially like the idea that whatever the person focuses on the most right before they die correlates to the \"power\" that they develop when they're brought back. . I like the ending although I really want to see what happens next."}
{"text": "I received this book for free in return for an honest review. \n After reading the first book I was definitely hooked. So I signed up for the mailing list to get updates on when the next book will come out. Well ... I am definitely not disappointed I did!! \n WHAT an ending??!?!?!! I seriously can't wait for the next book to come out!! This second installment is even better than the first one! It's full of action, death, snarky comments, humor, and that sexual tension between Rosalin and Caine! This book definitely pulls you in and it's so hard to put down! \n I love how Tammi is a very consistent character across the book. She's kind of like the light in Rosalin's dark tunnel. Cain, what is his deal. He seems like he's trying to distance himself from everyone and everything, but sometimes a softer side of him comes out. Is he really the monster he's thought of by everyone? Malphus has more to him than just Caine's brother. He liked Rosalin when they were younger even though she was a brat. What's that all about? Definitely peeks my interest. I don't mind a little love triangle or what ever love shape there may be. Those are always fun and comical to read about. Drew, I'm glad he's not made to be this annoying villain everyone would love to hate. We already have the head of the Brotherhood for that. There's so much more to come from this guy for sure. And Ambrose, is he a good guy or is he a bad guy? Jury is still up for him. \n I want to know what will happen between Roslin and Cain!! I'm also curious about the outcome between Rosalin and Drew, Rosalin and Malphus, and Rosalin and Ambrose. Also, I'm also interested in finding out more about the second souls within Caine, Miranda, and Rosalin. \n So much is going on in this book, but somehow it doesn't feel overwhelming. It just flows from one to the next. Definitely anticipating the release for the third book."}
{"text": "It's amazing exactly what books will attract your attention and pull you in from the start. For one reason or another Icefall really grabbed my attention and had me staying up to the wee hours of the morning trying to finish this book. \n Expectations going into Icefall weren't really high. I had read Matthew J. Kirby's debut novel The Clockwork Three and was utterly disappointed. It wasn't so much the writing style or even the plot, but there is a continuing habit to market Kirby's books as fantasy when in reality they are more about the characters, character interactions and emotions of the surrounding society. This was my biggest disappointment about The Clockwork Three, so I didn't know what to expect when I picked up Icefall. \n Icefall is very similar to The Clockwork Three in that the plot element surrounds character development and focuses on the emotions of the characters. While there isn't any magic, the sheer fact that Kirby created this Viking society is enough to classify it as a \"fantasy\". Readers going into the novel who know not to expect a rip-roaring adventure or tons of magic won't be disappointed. \n Kirby is an excellent master at creating a main character that is three dimensional and a supporting cast that is fleshed out and detailed. From the first couple of pages there was just something about Solveig that attracted me to her. Solveig is the second daughter to the king. She isn't extremely beautiful, and since she won't inherit the throne her father tends to overlook her. Throughout Icefall, Solveig learns who she really is and changes from a self-conscious, quiet daughter to a confident, young woman full of self-esteem. \n Fans of Norse folklore will really enjoy the various mythology and cultural elements that Kirby weaved into the story. While the country and characters are made up they very well could have been any person or culture from the Viking era. \n One of the most amazing things for myself was how Kirby took an essentially small area and made it really come to life. The whole novel takes place in this secluded area that is cut off for the winter. One would think that this could lead to a boring novel as there isn't really a change in environment or world, but Kirby really brings it to life and knows just when to unveil a new plot element so the small setting doesn't go stale. \n There is only one element of Icefall that I would change. I really wish that the ending had been more developed. I am assuming this is a stand-alone novel and the ending was wide open and left a lot to the reader's imagination. I would have loved to see what really happened to the characters in the novel as I had formed such close bonds with all of them. \n Icefall is truly a whirlwind novel about survival that is filled with heartwarming characters, mystery and intrigue. Readers both young and old will find themselves attracted to Solveig and working alongside her to uncover who the traitor is and work to get her and her family back home safely."}

{"text": "*3.5 stars* \n I was extremely excited to get my hands on Glass Sword, I really enjoyed Red Queen so much and it really left us hanging at the end of the book. The first half of the book was slow but eventually really picked up the second half(kind of how Red Queen was.) There was a lot of action and fighting going on and events that really threw me at times, but then later explained.....thank goodness! \n I only really have one complaint and the reason I only gave it 3.5 stars, there wasn't much romance going on. Ugh....I just really wanted the good romance that was going on during Red Queen. Mare and Cal were just awkward and weird with each other, obviously they love each other but neither one of them could actually express this to each other. I found that completely annoying and really unrealistic, I mean, if you're constantly fighting and running from the king and his soldiers and you never know when the last time you will see each other, wouldn't you want the person that you love to know that? I guess that is just me. \n Obviously, Mare hated Maven and he was just an evil, awful king who wanted her in his possession and would do anything to hurt her or Cal. I really wouldn't mind having him killed in the third book (there better be a third book, this one leaves you hanging too.) \n Shade and Mare had an awesome brother sister relationship and I loved seeing that relationship grow. My heart was truly broken when things didn't go as planned during an attack. I feel like this book had a lot of sadness and just plain evil going on. I really hope the next book will have some better times for Mare and Cal.\""}
{"text": "This was quite a complex story involving Travis, a wolf shifter who lives in the enchanted town of Arcada, and Dylan who is Fae. Dylan has sworn an oath which keeps him slave to the evil Ulric and must enter Arcada to complete his last mission or forever remain enslaved. \n I found the first 30% or so of the book a little confusing as I struggled to understand the different types of folk living in Arcada and understand the complex dream world that Dylan was able to enter. This was probably just a personal thing for me as I enjoy the occasional PNR but am not a huge fan of fantasy worlds so probably don't have the patience to immerse myself in the world created. \n The plot is not a simple one, also focusing on internal pack politics and an attack by a rogue wolf pack, their evil Alpha trying to gain control of the town. \n With so much going on, I found myself just wishing for a simple focus on the romance between the two men. I enjoyed the elements of dominance/submission which occurred early in Dylan and Travis' relationship and the theme of not trying to define people in categories of black and white. \n I think lovers of PNR will really enjoy this story because the main characters are very likable and the world well crafted."}

{"text": "This is an adorable middle-grade retelling. While I found Cinderella's POV to be tedious, Char is an amazing character. Char is the prince of the Northern rats, and he lives in the manor of Cinderella's family. Char admires Cinderella's thrifty, rat-like qualities, and this is reciprocated later when Cinderella falls for Char's very human braveness, courage, and grace. Char's relationships with everyone from Swiss to his mom to Cinderella are filled with his own grandiose personality, and everyone clearly loves him for it. There's a nice twist to the 'classic' tale that made the scene of the ball really heartwrenching, but because this is MG, you're going to get the happy ending. This is a quality book to read if you want a clean, sweet romance with an interesting character and a heart-melting ending."}

Expanding and giving depth to the classic Cinderella story, Levine creates a believable fantasy world where the Cinderella story is better understood. A quick read (or listen if you decide to go with the audiobook version), you still come away feeling like your time reading/listening was well spent. I fell in love with Prince Char and loathed the stepmother and ugly stepsisters. The story is simple, but it's well written and well told. The twist with Ella's curse adds certain depth/meaning to the story that makes this re-told fairy tale appealing to young adults. I just love this book."}

{"text": "2.5 stelline! \n Questo e uno dei rari casi, in cui la sinossi e molto piu interessante dell'intero libro. \n \"Non lasciarmi mai\"era nella mia WL da diversi mesi, perche aveva potenzialmente tutti i requisisti giusti per diventare uno dei miei libri preferiti. \n Trama misteriosa, storia d'amore impossibile, ed infine un pov maschile che mi incuriosiva parecchio. Invece l'intero libro e di una lentezza assurda, interi capitoli che ruotano attorno al nulla, il tutto unito ad uno stile scialbo e ridondante. \n L'aspetto che mi ha particolarmente infastidito e senza dubbio la \"confusione generale\". Tutta la vicenda ruota intorno ad un incidente, dove nel primo caso perde la vita la ragazza del protagonista VIv (che etichettare come egoista ed antipatica e alquanto riduttivo...). Ma a creare maggiore confusione e l'altro presente alternativo: una sorta di pseudo universo parallelo, in cui a perdere la vita e il nostro protagonista Camden. \n Una luce che permette a tutti i protagonisti, a turno, di entrare ed uscire da questa o quella realta, a loro piacimento... Intanto Cam soffre per la mancanza di VIv, rimugina per interi capitoli, e vive insieme alla madre in un porcile di appartamento, e mangia appena. \n Nina, che per inciso capisco poco, ma perlomeno mi sta simpatica e la migliore amica di Cam. Colei che involontariamente gli fa conoscere questa realta parallela, dando a Cam la speranza di riabbracciare la sua VIv! (Ma anche no, dico io). \n Man mano che il libro procede, sempre a passo di lumaca drogata e stra fatta di sonniferi, la storia porta il protagonista a capire, che la sua defunta e da poco ritrovata VIv, non e altro che una folle senza un briciolo di ragione! \n Che meraviglia, facciamolo a pezzi sto povero ragazzo vah! \n In pratica, per come la vedo io, l'autrice scredita l'amore reciproco dei protagonisti, in maniera tale da fare superare a Cam il suo dolore... Intanto piazza in mezzo la dolce ed innocente Nina, che si rivelera pure stracotta del nostro bel Cam!!! \n Wowwwwww \"Non lasciarmi mai\" diventa \"Per favore potresti toglierti dalle scatole pazza?\" \n Il finale e boh? Quello che l'autrice racconta in mezzo paragrafo e un finale? \n Ancora non so dirvi se si o no... Ma di certo questa lettura si e rivelata tutto, fuorche quello che mi sarei aspettata! \n Un vero peccato dato che le premesse per un buon libro c'erano tutte!"}
{"text": "One of my all time favourite short stories. While I'm reading it I can see Mr Truepenny and be in his Book Emporium, the idea of real daydreams and continuous dreaming has great appeal."}
{"text": "Ok so first of all I had somewhat high expectations because I've seen this book everywhere and I've heard a lot of good/bad reviews. The description of the book seemed kind of unique and intriguing so I had high hopes but I'm sad to say that this book was disappointing. I can't deny that the book made me feel sad for the character and that the oddly creative descriptions were intriguing at first but the style of writing really got tiring around 40% into the book. I understand the state of mind that the main character is in and it explains why she describes things the way she does but after a while it got to be a bit too much. I can't deny that some of the descriptions were so ridiculous that there were eye rolling/eyebrow raising/laughing moments. I just feel that the author tried way too hard to be poetic/creative when writing this book. It got tiring really quick and I honestly really wanted to like this book but I felt like I was reading fan fiction. The writing seemed choppy and the story was centered around main points and didn't really have any calm/in between moments (if that makes sense?). The story was too centered around romance which highly disappointed me. I thought the overall idea of the storyline was good but didn't live up to itself. The storyline reminded me of Divergent and Delirium quite a bit. I honestly don't know if I'll read the next book because of how annoying the book was but maybe I'll just read the next book to find out the ending. *shrugs* I wouldn't really recommend this book to someone but either people love this book or hate it so I guess if you really want to read it I can't say I didn't warn you."}

{"text": "This is such a hard story to review. It's a story that has a very emotional feel but those emotions aren't necessarily pleasant. There are so many sad elements to this story - illness, neglect, rejection, suicide and self harm - that I found myself feeling quite down. And with all this sadness, it was almost uncomfortable to see the sexual elements play out. \n I think the author did a wonderful job in creating a story that conveys sorrow and pain. However, although the ending touches on Lucas being in a better place, about to start his 'true life', I still felt quite unsettled at the ending - there's a sense that happiness will come but it didn't translate to the story ending on a positive note in terms of my own emotions. But sometimes that can be a good thing and it certainly had me pondering a number of issues. \n So my advise for readers...it's only a short story but be prepared for some serious issues to be raised. This is not your traditional romance so don't expect hearts and flowers. \n I now publish all my m/m reviews on my blog so if you want to see all my m/m reviews in one place come visit at Because Two Men Are Better Than One!"}

{"text": "Like everyone else, I picked this up because Gillian Anderson co-authored it. The woman is a damn good actress, so I was hoping that her book would suck because one person shouldn't be imbued with so much talent and be gorgeous to boot. It's hard to judge whether Anderson is any good as a writter though, because she teamed up with an oldhand in the form of sci-fi writer Jeff Rovin. \n The book centres around Caitlin O'Hara, an adolescent psychiatrist, who is drawn into the mystery illness of the daughter of a diplomat. The result is a thriller that mixes international tensions with psychic experiences. The story is a page turner in the sense that it's easy to read and keep reading. It's conventionally written and hewn from the same template as your usual disaster/sci fi flick. The opening chapters for instance are scenes we've all seen at the movies. \n I tried my best not to see Caitlin and Ben, her translator buddy, as Scully and Mulder but it was hard when the authors present an essentially paranormal situation and then had the lead character experience it and then argue against it all the way. There's also an uncanny similarity to one X Files scene (involving mass ascension). Try not to picture Dana Scully there. I mean c'mon even the name O'Hara makes her sound like a redhead! \n I'm don't read sci fi or fantasy generally and the book loses me when the mention of demons come up and fumbles its way towards a sort of all-encompassing general theory of new ageyness. \n The best part of the book is the relationship between Caitlin and her son Jacob. The guilt of being a working mother and the constant worry for her child is rare in the fiction I've read, and the connection between Caitlin and Jacob is heartfelt and unique. \n The book ends with a beautiful cliffhanger that sets the stage for upcoming installments of the series. Will I be reading the rest of the Earthend Saga? I don't know. We'll probably be too busy looking out for the movie!"}
{"text": "Really great book which is a slighly bit slow to develop but really good in the end. I loved the relationship of Conn and the wizard. Very quick moving book. Everything was simple but not overly simple. \n The only problem I had with this book was how the wizard didn't believe Conn whenever he said anything. It seemed a little out of character for him. The wizard was so trusting but yet let this boy that he hardly know live in his house, and then he was so quick to judge him and undermine him when Conn would bring anything up. That was the ONLY problem I found."}
{"text": "You'd think this book was the best book since baked potatoes? Well, you're wrong. \n I think James Patterson is an incredible author. Incredible. And many of his books easily fit in a 'library-of-fame,' so to speak. But this book? Holy moly cannoli! This is easily one of the worst books since coconut-filled chocolates. Ghastly! Horrendous! \n To tell you the truth, I didn't even finish the book. But I must say, I was more than two thirds into it. There was no spark to give me the least of an emotional experience. The characters, I think, are as shallow as you can ever get in the Dead Sea, and the plot is really, really not good. \n So if you're thinking of buying this book, and you're already holding it at the bookstore, accept my advice: turn back. It's not worth the journey. More so, your money. \n James Patterson is an incredible writer - a shepherd to the greatest reads of the era. But I've got to say - this is a black sheep in his flock of writings. A really, really pitch-black sheep. \n Sorry."}

{"text": "Benvenuti al consueto spazio delle recensioni della \"pecora nera Alex\". \n Anche questa volta il mio parere e diametralmente opposto al pensiero comune, dato che questo libro mi e sembrato insignificante e scontato. \n Die for me di Amy Plum e un libro che miracolosamente ha mantenuto la sua stupenda cover originale, strano ma vero.... E su cui avevo sentito meraviglie. \n Andiamo con ordine: \n 1) La fama dell'autrice. \n 2) La cover originale. \n 3) La trama interessante. \n 4) Uno YA a tinte romance che mai dispiace. \n Allora spiegatemi perche la Plum mi racconta una storiella ridicola con bambinetti che sembrano aver superato, appena, la fase dello svezzamento?! \n Ecco a parte la mia brutalita nell'esternare il mio pensiero, vorrei sinceramente capire perche la Plum, pur avendo sotto le mani tutto questo materiale, abbia ritenuto opportuno fare sembrare i suoi personaggi balbettanti mocciosi, tutti baci, smancerie e insulsaggini varie... \n La nostra protagonista, tale Kate (il nome mi richiama alla mente un'altra deficente...) e orfana di entrambi i genitori morti in un incidente... Quindi con la sorella da Brooklyn si trasferisce a Parigi dai nonni. La povera ragazza l'e depressa, giustamente, per la sua grave perdita... Ma a risvegliare il suo interesse, facendo breccia nella cortina di solitudine e tristezza, ta ta tammmm ecco che arriva il \"solito/scontato/prevedibile\" tocco de gnocco, che con il suo fasciiiiino irresistibile e il suo essere mooooto secccccsii.... Mi fa sbarellare la porella della Kate! \n Oh perbacco che colpo di scena, applausi fuori campo. \n Lui, il Vincent, se vi dico che gia e innamorato pazzamente, follemente, incondizionatamente e irrimediabilmente di Kate mi credereste?!?!? \n Of corse!!! \n Lei flirta e cerca di tenerlo lontano perche crede sia pericoloso, ma ha accumulato gia ettolitri di bava... \n Lui la snobba ma gia immagina di spalmarla sul primo muro che trova... \n Ma colpo di scena number 2: lui e un revenant, non ditemi di spiegarvi tutto il discorso che io mi ci raccapezzo appena eh! \n Accontentatevi di sapere per sommi capi, che lui e una specie di angelo custode o roba simile, morto per altruismo e percio \"ritornato\" da immortale per continuare a salvare vite. \n Gia a questo punto avevo un cerchio alla testa si?! \n Insomma per farla breve, na banda de zombie buoni che ha una faida con la banda degli zombie cattivi... Tutti questi qui non dormano mai, eh ma non brillano al sole ok?! \n Comunque dormono per tre giorni con l'anima che fluttua tipo camper, ma piu tendente allo stalker-guardone... \n Kate e Vincent fanno tira e molla: amore ti lascio ma mi struggo per te, ti limono ma non possiamo stare insieme... \n Perdinci fateci un favore: strombacchiate!!!! \n Santa pazienza sti due hanno una frustrazione sessuale che fa paura xd! \n Il finale con rocamboleschi colpi \"scontati\" di scena mi ha fatto emozionare come una pila di roba da stirare, tanto era al cardiopalma! \n Cioe sono stata un po' bastarda, ma il libro e stato una totale delusione, sia dal punto di vista della trama che dell'evoluzione dei personaggi. Lo stile della Plum pur essendo scorrevole e fin troppo young anche nei contenuti, e i personaggi sono privi del benche minimo spessore. Oltre a risultare troppo infantili e per nulla interessanti. \n Pathos : 0 \n Sensualita : non pervenuta. \n Azione : vi faremo sapere. \n Romanticissimo : na botta de carie! \n A parte la cover non mi e piaciuto nulla"}
{"text": "I just want to start out by saying man, that cover. So beautiful. \n Now onto the review. \n There was a lot to like here, but for me, it just wasn't enough. \n The plot itself was great. Thea Robinson is the independent, feisty heroine that has the ability to manipulate people's emotions. She suddenly starts seeing things, nasty creatures that turn out to be a variety of demons. She finds out that she is Nephilim, a half human, half angel. Cam is a Power angel, a high ranking angel that fights demons. Cam's commander assigns him to properly train Thea so that she can begin fighting demons, as that is the job of the Nephilim. They don't get along at first, of course, and Cam finds himself attracted to her and loves that Thea has no problem with putting him in his place. It's a pretty standard PNR plot, but I really enjoyed the world building. Mostly. \n I say mostly because there were there some problems. Why does someone with a paranormal gift find it so difficult to believe that there are angels? She's already seeing demons. There were inconsistencies that were so confusing. For example, in chapter eight, Cam tells Thea that his job is to help her learn to kill demons, because that is what Nephilim do. In the next chapter, Thea asks what would happen if she kills a demon, he tells her that Nephilim don't usually have the power to kill demons. \n Cam, impressed with Thea's bravery and talent for fighting, thinks to himself that he had heard from other angels that Nephilim were know to be reluctant to fight at first, afraid of pain and death. That made me wonder why exactly it was their job to hunt demons. Especially considering other angels (such as Cam himself) kill demons as well. They seem more suited to the job. After training Thea for months, when she and Cam are finally fighting an actual demon, he has to tell her in the middle of it to avoid the demon's blood. Why didn't she know this? With a world as unique as this, a lot of explanation is needed. Perhaps it would have worked better as a full length novel. I wanted to know more. I thought this book did a wonderful job of putting a really original spin on an increasingly common sub-genre of PNR. What was there was interesting and exciting. It just wasn't enough. \n I enjoyed the romance, but once again, I think it could have benefited from just more. The best part about \"mate\" romances is that it really gives permission for instalove. There is a legitimate reason for that all-powerful passionate attraction felt between two seemingly mismatched people. But there needs to be more. There needs to be the after, when they both realize that there is more to it than \"because destiny\". I don't think the book really went into that enough. What reasons were given didn't feel like enough to justify the relationship, at least to me. \n This book had a lot going for it, but in my opinion, it never really reached its full potential. \n *ARC generously provided by the author in exchange for a fair and honest review. \n Just a side note here, but doesn't amazon own goodreads? Could they not synchronize their rating system a bit better? It feels weird to leave two different star ratings for the same book. SO CONFUSING. Okay, now I'm done."}
{"text": "Lover Avenged was surprisingly good and likable. Since Rehvenge wasn't one of the Brotherhood, I wasn't much inclined to read it.

But once I actually started reading it, well, J.R.Ward has won me over again. \n One of my favourite quirks about the Black Dagger Brotherhood series is that J.R.Ward never finds time to be repetitious about her main characters. It's not just about vampires who fall in love with humans and vice-versa. It has everything from sympaths and vampires to the Chosen and humans. \n Rehvenge was beautiful. He had a strong personality and he would do anything for the people he cared about, even kill for them. What I loved about him was the way he was portrayed. In all the other Brotherhood novels, all the guys are described visually different but their personalities (except for Zsadist) are extremely similar. Rehvenge was unique. \n I will definitely reading the next book in the series."}

{"text": "This is an original take on the Alpha/Omega trope. A very HOT one at that, since Omegas are males that instead of creating a pack by reproduction, instead have an emphatic ability that allows them to link its members (well, that and the group sex) and keep larger groups of Alpha wolves from fighting each other. \n Did I mention hot? I'm normally not a fan of love at first sight or even lust at first sight that's strong enough to overcome reason; but it worked here. Sam and Rusty look at each other and fireworks go off all around, innocent bystanders having to cover their eyes to avoid melting from the crazy chemistry these two have. \n Besides the plot, the writing is just captivating, I opened it to have a casual look and found myself blinking after my eyes started to hurt, I had read about half the novel! Sam and Rusty are both likeable and interesting guys, and I'm looking forward to the pack of secondary characters the series seem to be promising. \n Book II is on my to read list as soon as it's out."}
{"text": "Celaena Sardothien is an assassin, a fact which both men infatuated with her would much rather forget. Prince Dorian is all too aware of this particular affliction of hers, as his father insists upon having him in the room for every gruesome detail. Chaol of course is also painfully aware that not only does her profession provide an impediment; their ranks are unequal. This does not stop either of them from falling maddeningly in love with her. \n Crown of Midnight was such a satisfying read, although I had already figured out some of the major plot-twists well before their reveal. Archer can go die in a hole as far as I am concerned, snivelling sack of crazy that he is. Sarah J Maas, just so you know, I am not likely to forgive you for a certain something happening to a certain someone in this book (fairly certain you know which someone, and what something)."}

Los personajes tampoco son el fuerte de \"Medio rey\" de hecho nos importan mas bien poco ya que no se profundiza para nada en ellos; y tampoco hay ni rastro de romance ni \"bromance\" asi que a Abercrombie en esta ocasion le ha quedado un poco soso el guiso. \n Pero bueno en lineas generales, por el final (con su correspondiente sorpresa) que me ha gustado y por el world building creado sobre todo con el lenguaje (\"cruzar la puerta final\" el padre luna , la madre Guerra\"...) se gana una estrella.

I was so excited to read this book for the plot and while the book in actuality wasn't bad, I had a lot of expectations going into it and there's quite a few things I wish would have happened differently. While this book is definitely a slow building story and you have to have a good amount of patientence before you get to the pay off, I did enjoy reading it and will continue with the sequel. \n This was definitely a unique book. The story takes place in a matriarchal society where every generation, a set of triplett queens is born, each posessing a different type of magic--the ability to poison, the ability to control elements, or the ability to control animals and nature. Each queen is then sent to live with others of their gift until they turn sixteen years old, when they then fight to the death to determine who will be the one true queen. I was really happy that we got to see from each of the queens perspectives in this book, but I also thought that we got too many different perspectives from side characters. It was overwhelming and confusing at times and I would have prefered it to just have been the three queens. I also went into this thinking that we were actually going to get to see the fight, but majority of the book takes place before they turn sixteen. I thought it made the book a little boring and slower but knowing where the book leaves off and having all of the character and world development discussed in this book, I think the second book has been set up to be pretty amazing."}

{"text": "Ho aspettato con ansia e trepidazione il corriere e ringrazio la Mondadori per avermi inviato una copia di Devilish. \n Appena terminato la lettura vi lascio la mia personale impressione a riguardo! \n Angel aveva sicuramente fatto breccia nel mio cuore e su Devilish avevo riposto grandi aspettative che devo dire sono state a grandi linee mantenute. \n Desidero che questo momento duri per sempre. \n Che nulla cambi mai. \n Per sempre ora. \n Per sempre adesso. \n E per sempre noi! \n Vichi e Guglielmo hanno trascorso segretamente insieme la loro prima estate a Viterbo attenti anche solo a sfiorarsi in pubblico ma liberi di amarsi come solo un demone e un angelo a meta possono fare.Lorenzo e sempre piu in sintonia con Paride che da acerrimo nemico di Vittoria ora e in effetti un'altra persona disponibile e affidabile. \n Ginevra continua a studiare a Londra cercando di nascondere persino a Vittoria il suo disagio e la sua solitudine anche nella caotica City... \n Un nuovo anno scolastico e alle porte e tutto sempre essere sereno e immutato... tutto in sospeso e la minaccia di Eva sempre in agguato riportare con se nell'Averno Guglielmo per sempre! \n Per questo motivo i quattro ragazzi cercano di mettere a punto un piano per non farsi cogliere di sorpresa ed essere pronti a fronteggiare sullo stesso piano Eva. \n Ma conoscono ben poco del mondo degli angeli e ancora meno di quello dei demoni, con le poche informazioni in possesso di Guglielmo scoprono l'esistenza di un volume segreto che parla di angeli e demoni e delle creature che risiedono di mezzo... ma ogni copia di questo libro e stata accuratamente manomessa, privata delle informazioni che necessitano loro per conoscere la verita, solo un indizio su ogni libro, la \"stamperia inesistente\". \n Intanto Vittoria inizia ad avvertire un malessere sempre piu diffuso sia nel corpo che nella mente.. dolori lancinanti quanto improvvisi, visioni inquietanti, incubi premonitori, allucinazioni, ombre oscure e fantasmi rendono Vichi irrequieta e distante persino da Guglielmo. \n Dopo svariate ricerche scoprono una data, il 1deg di novembre, ovvero Samhain, l'unico giorno nel quale le ombre oscure, i demoni, possono uscire dal confine dell'Averno, il Bulicame. Bloccare questo passaggio e fondamentale per salvare Viterbo e il futuro dei suoi abitanti. \n Una vera e propria lotta contro il tempo e mille avversita che si presenteranno ad ogni angolo.... il tempo scorre veloce e inesorabile ad ogni battito, e gli indizi sembrano portare sempre ad un vicolo ceco... Fontane che esplodono acido nero e il cielo che si tinge di color piombo in piena mattina, tutti segnali che lasciano presagire il temuto conto alla rovescia... ma una rivelazione portera con se la soluzione di tutto! \n Il malessere di Vittoria peggiora velocemente proprio il suo cambiamento dara la svolta a tutto il libro, dandole una nuova consapevolezza di se stessa e delle sue potenzialita. Non piu un angelo a meta ma qualcosa di infinitamente sorprendente! \n Promettimi una cosa.. \n Che cosa? \n Mi devi promettere che non cambiera niente,che non importa quello che potrei diventare...... \n Mi devi promettere di restare al mio fianco! \n La fragile,insicura e vulnerabile Vittoria pur di salvare il suo amore e le persone che ama scendera nell'Averno, affrontando l'oscurita in persona, sola in un'impresa ardua quanto impossibile... \n Una Viterbo oscura e misteriosa teatro di una cruenta battaglia finale tra angeli e demoni... \n L'amore come unica arma potente contro un tocco che brucia e uccide... \n Un fragile angelo che nasconde una forza e un coraggio senza eguali... \n In Devilish azione e dinamicita sicuramente sono le parole chiave, in questo ultimo capitolo la De Spirito convoglia scene adrenaliniche, suspance e sentimenti in una trama scorrevole e interessante. Abbandonati i toni poetici e misteriosi di Angel, in Devilish la protagonista impara a prendere coscienza di se stessa e del suo potenziale, ogni personaggio assume una nuova valenza all'interno del racconto.Il passato ritorna per fare luce sugli eventi oscuri che si scatenano man mano nella storia. \n Da inguaribile romantica forse avrei voluto dei risvolti emotivi piu intensi, ma la storia di certo non manca di spiragli amorosi e poetici. \n Lo stile della De Spirito in questo ultimo capitolo ha assunto sfumature piu dark, l'intera trama e enigmatica e conduce il lettore insieme ai protagonisti alla ricerca della soluzione delle incognite. \n Ogni personaggio risulta interessante ma fra tutti sicuramente Vittoria e il fulcro dell'intera storia. Da angelo a meta diventa una vera e propria eroina che abbraccia la sua causa e si spinge ben oltre le sue paure per riscattare il suo amore. Combattiva, fragile e determinata ma tremendamente in difficolta quando deve esternare i suoi sentimenti a Guglielmo. \n Il misterioso e affascinante demone Guglielmo in Devilish mi e apparso un po in ombra, indubbiamente avrei preferito maggiore intensita e dinamicita nel suo personaggio. \n Una bella scoperta e stato Paride che avevo detestato ma che adesso ho trovato un vero e sincero amico, pari a Lore. \n Le new-entry, il professore ed il figlio, sono stati personaggi interessanti e importanti ai fini degli sviluppi della storia. Eva che era stata una figura perfida e pericolosa adesso sembra fin troppo docile e prevedibile. Lo stesso \"Signore delle ombre\", che rappresenta l'oscurita, sarebbe dovuto essere un tantino meno accondiscendente con i protagonisti... un demone troppo bonaccione direi ;) E finalmente la zia Nora esce dall'anonimato svelando il suo passato doloroso che diventa un importante tassello dell'enigma stesso. \n Alcuni libri creano delle nicchie nella nostra mente e pochissimi nel nostro cuore...Questo e stato per me Angel una dolcissima poesia misteriosa sull'amore impossibile e Devilish ha sviluppato le dinamiche impossibili di questo amore,rincorrendo la redenzione di un'anima dannata! \n L'amore non e solo un demone. \n L'amore e un demone quando fa urlare e soffrire. \n E' un angelo quando ti aiuta e ti prende per mano. \n E' una piccola luce che ti salva dal buio. \n Che non sconfigge il buio,non annulla la paura o le tenebre. \n Ma ti permette di entrarci e uscirne viva. \n L'amore e una persona! \n Ho apprezzato il cambio di toni e la trama ricca di azione in Devilish, la maturita dei personaggi, Viterbo bella e allo stesso tempo inquietante, ma non sono stata ammaliata da questo libro come dal precedente pur consigliandovene la lettura ;) \n Voto: 3 stelle Goodreads"}

{"text": "This book picks up where the last one left us: (SPOILERS about the first two books ahead!!!) \n Titus and Iola are in the desert rebel's camp and are being under attack by Atlantis. They know now that Iola isn't supposed to defeat the Bane according to Titu's mother's visions, but they are willing to try anyway. With little time left and no real plan, they must enter Atlantis domain and kill the Bane without falling in his hands, because if they do, Iola will be sacrificed and the Bane's life will be prolonged. \n What a great way to end a trilogy. I have to admit, I read this too quickly, but I enjoyed it immensely. It was fast paced most of the time, it starts with a big battle and it ends with one. \n I loved every character. Iola and Titus were great, I loved their relationship. Iola is strong, determined, smart and powerful. She cares about her family and friends but she makes her own choices, and she lets them make their own too. Titus is the same: even if he wants to protect her, he lets her decide her own fate except when he drugged her, but he was out of his mind at that moment; and he knew it wouldn't really matter, but he had to at least try . I wanted them to have a happy ending together, even if fate seemed against them. I mean, I didn't want to believe either or both of them were going to die. Thank god I was right. \n I loved every secondary character: Kashkari was amazing though I wanted a happier ending for him. I knew he wouldn't end up with Amaram, but maybe he could learn to love her as a sister . Amaram was even more amazing; determined, strong and a fighter. I wish there were more female characters like her. Her sacrifice was so sad, but noble . I also loved the relationship between Master Heywood and Iola. It was so sweet... I knew he as going to sacrifice himself for her. But it made me happy that he could know that Iola was his friend's daughter and that he got to say goodbye. I was also sad about Mrs. Hancock. There were a lot of surprises at the end. The vision about Iola being about Amara, Iola not being Lady Calista's daughter, Commander Rainstone being an ally and in love with Titus mom! And Titus father being caught by the Bane I definitively didn't see any of that coming. \n Overall, I'm sad because its the end of a trilogy of boks that I loved, but it was a great ending."}
{"text": "This is a beautifully written collection. Hawes retells six familiar stories and a nursery rhyme. Rather than the idyllic heroes and princesses, these are stories of human desire, frailty, cruelty, and loyalty. Reacquaint yourself with Jack the Giant-killer, Hansel and Gretel, the Pied Piper of Hamlin and Lady Godiva. Meet Rapunzel's mother, as well as the seventh of the seven dwarves, and the emasculated prince who married Cinderella. \n Kirkus Reviews writes that these seven tales are \n magical and sometimes erotic happily-never-after retellings. . . In this sinister, highly sexual faerie world, heroes are often evil and villains are sometimes innocents who simply don't get to tell their side of the story. \n I considered this point of view for a long time, because I didn't find this book to be erotic or highly sexual. Certainly the Grimm Brothers' tales can be as dark as anything Hawes has offered here. Perhaps Kirkus Reviews are comparing the tales to the G-rated Disney versions. In that case, then...yes. Hawe's faerie world is \"sinister and highly sexual.\" \n Instead of \"sexual,\" however, I would use the word \"appetite.\" Hawe's collection of tales shows human appetites in all their variations: for money, for fame, for ease, and, yes, for sexual connection, as well as sexual gratification. Further, Hawes writes in tones as darkly lush and precious as any jewel, pearls or no. \n I recommend this book on its own literary merits, but if I still haven't convinced you to read it, consider this: I have one good reason for you to read this book. The illustration of the Pied Piper of Hamlin makes any imagining of Edward Cullen seem like a toad-faced bottom-dweller. Rebecca Guay's illustrations make these black pearls truly luminous."}
{"text": "4.5 - 5 Stars!! \n \"It's always the ones who are the quietest who often have the greatest things to say. And yes, I think we'll be friends.\" \n Simple, beautiful and unforgettable, 'Wolfsong' was one of the most gripping books I've read all year. Never in a million years did I think I would love a book about werewolves with a little fantasy sprinkled in but this book and this writing is just gorgeous. If you want to take a chance an read something that is a little outside your comfort zone, read this book!! I will never forget the great Ox and the entire Bennett family. \n A story about love, devotion, loyalty, friendship and family, 'Wolfsong' was also one of the most stunning love stories I've ever read. Ox, a kind, lovely soul, lives in a small town and lives a very quiet life with his mother. Until he meets Joe, and then his whole world is turned upside down. \n \"Words. Words were my enemy. How to say that here was where I felt the safest. Here was where I felt most at home. Here was where I wouldn't be judged. I wasn't a fucking retard here. I wasn't a waste of space or time. I wanted to say so much, too much, and found I couldn't really say anything at all.\" \n I highlighted so much of this epic story that my entire review could be made of quotes from this extraordinary book! Every character, every scene felt necessary and breathtaking. The bonds between Ox, Joe and the Bennett family seemed unbreakable and I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see where this amazing author would take, me. This book is quite a journey and I loved every single minute. \n \"It was not a gradual thing. Wait. That was a lie. I didn't know it was a gradual thing. But it must have been. It had to have been. Because it's the only thing that explained the cosmic explosion that was the feeling of want and need and mine mine mine. The force of it was ridiculous. It had to have been there. For a long time.\" \n Fantasy books are usually not my thing but this book completely grabbed me from the first page. I felt as if I knew each of these characters. I wanted to wrap my arms around Ox and give him a big hug. These characters literally came to life before my eyes! I became entranced by the Oregon setting and the Bennett clan. I only wanted Ox and Joe to have their happy ending because they both deserved it so, so much. \n \"I would do anything to make you happy because no one had ever smelled like you did. It was candy canes and pinecones. It was epic and awesome. And it was home. You smelled like my home, Ox.\" \n I don't want to go into detail about the plot because it was surprising and thrilling. Take a chance on 'Wolfsong' and read this book! It was simply glorious. Definitely one of those books that would make a fantastic movie. \n \"It's easy to get lost, Ox, because the world is a wide and scary place. And every now and then, you just have to be reminded of the way home.\""}

{"text": "3.5 stars \n Sedona Snow is used to trouble. Her parents were married to other people when they met, so when they fell in love and ran away to start a new life, their families cut them off and considered Sedona's existence to be the equivalent of adding insult to injury. After her parents died, those same relatives though it best to hide her away in boarding school until she came of age, whereupon they told her she was now on her own. \n Later years haven't provided her with much of a reversal of fortune, as her paranormal skills have brought her to the attention of a mad scientist who has kidnapped her in order to subject her to torturous experiments. After escaping, she soon finds that her disappearance has caused her fiance to move on without hesitation. Feeling that she needs a clean break, Sedona moves to Rainshadow Island, where misfits actually fit in perfectly. \n Unfortunately, a change of place doesn't really alter Sedona's luck. Soon she is dealing with renewed attention from her slimy ex-fiancee, the reappearance of the scientist who previously held her hostage, and the unexplained contact of various member of the family who disowned her so long ago, as well as more paranormal danger than one woman can handle. \n It's a good thing she doesn't have to deal with any of it alone then- new Guild Boss Cyrus Jones has taken a personal interest in Sedona's plight, and given the sparks that occur whenever they're near each other, Sedona is inclined to accept his offer of a working relationship- and any other union that might develop. \n Typical Castle/Krentz, which is typically fun. Definitely a must read for fans, though newbies are strongly encouraged to start at the beginning of the series."}

{"text": "Initially I liked this book but I also found it a little cliched/predictable. Aside from the sprinkling of pseudo-Russian cultural allusions this seemed like a very standard \"sad overlooked orphan turned chosen one\" story that involves significant time at a magic school, another shop worn fantasy setting. \n However, as this book went on it impressed me more and more. The book becomes more complex and more tragic, the writing and dialogue more poignant. The characters become more nuanced and their relationships more emotionally affecting. \n This book has a satisfying arc of its own while also doing a good job setting up the next volume, which I will be reading immediately. I recommend it highly."}

{"text": "I try not to read sequels as they come out. With the exception of every Harry Potter book (yes, I attended three of the midnight release parties) and \n Breaking Dawn \n (which I bought two weeks after it was released), I wait until an entire trilogy, quartet or series are released in paperback before starting the first one. Like the Faerie Wars or the Derkholm books. I mean, I'm a Tamora Pierce junkie, but I'm still waiting to start the Terrier series. \n (Note on paperback v. hardback - it's a preference thing. Yeah, hardbacks are more expensive, at first, but mostly they're too cumbersome and unwieldy. I love the way a paperback nestles in my hands, bending slightly to my touch.) \n Anyway. \n A series of events ensued which resulted in my storming out of the house and to Target, just to get away from the insanity that surrounds my toddlers. I For escapist fiction, my choices were Eldest by Christopher Paolini or The Subtle Knife by Philip Pullman. I've read Eragon, but not The Golden Compass. \n Yeah, I bought Eldest. \n It went against my nature to do so, despite the fact that I bought it in paperback. But I figured that since the final book, Brisingr, was due within a few weeks (it was released today, September 20), I'd go ahead and read Eldest, even if it meant I bought Brisingr as a hardback. \n And then DAMMIT if I didn't find out too late that Brisingr is NOT the last book in the series - that there's a fourth and final installment. \n I'd read Eragon because I was keenly jealous of child-prodigy self-publisher Christopher Paolini. He began writing the book when he was 15, finished it when he was 19, and then self-published and marketed it before Knopf snatched it up. I was....ambivalent about Eragon. It was...okay. \n When they say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, I don't think it was a blanket acceptance of plagiarism. By the time I read Eldest, I expected the familiar plots, the Middle Earth sounding names, the slightly stilted language, the Star-Wars-type rebellion. I even started making a list. \n Arya=Arwen \n Eragon=Aragorn \n Eragon=dragon (duh) \n Urgals=Orks \n And those are just the words that sound the same. (Ra'zac=Nazgul, anyone?) \n Paolini has grown leaps and bounds as a writer, however. His dialogue, which has always been decent, really shines in Eldest. Further, he's successfully tackled the challenge of interweaving different story lines. His characterization has gotten much tighter, showing in the actions more than in too much description. The relationship between Eragon and Saphira continues to be endearing, showing Paolini's mature grasp of intimate friendship in a really delightful way. \n Eldest continues the tale of Eragon, country-boy-turned-Dragon-Rider, who has joined forces with the rebel band to overthrow the evil Darth Vader....er, I mean, King Galbatorix. In addition to Eragon's story, Paolini develops the story of Roran, Eragon's cousin. Roran, another country boy, defends the village when the Ra'zac come looking for Eragon, and helps evacuate when it's clear that's the only choice left for the villagers. Their exodus story juxtaposes nicely with Eragon's journey to Ellesme'ra to develop his magic under the tutelage of Obi-Wan Kenobi, er, Oromis. \n I hate to admit it, but I really, really enjoyed Eldest. While I'm not going to any midnight release parties for Brisingr, I certainly will be buying it (in paperback. After the fourth book is released in paperback.) I love the Inheritance Cycle so far. It's enchanting; while familiar, it's escapism at its best. \n It's like the CW's new show, Privileged. I want to hate it, but I just can't. I mean, come on, Paolini was homeschooled. Every time I think of it a new geek joke springs to mind. (And I have the right to tell geek jokes, as I am one. And blonde jokes, as I am one - well, artificially, anyway) \n But, as someone pointed out to me, Paolini has a legitimate \"runnin'-with-the-big-boys\"** contract. Complete with paycheck. And a pretty decent book in the process. Here's hoping Brisingr continues the trend. \n **and girls - my addition."}

It never slows down when introducing characters. We meet the other four main characters--Pheadra, Hunter, Bandu, and Criton--in the next several chapters. It becomes apparent something bad is going to happen, and all of the islanders except the five teens are dead by like chapter seven. This story really waste time and keeps the plot moving. There's enough in this book for an entire trilogy's worth of action, but it doesn't feel rushed. \n The entire Five Man Band--my favorite trope--is done exceedingly well here. The leader is, oddly enough, Narky, the murderer. The lancer is definitely Bandu, the feral child. Criton is the smart guy, Hunter is the big guy, and Phaedra is the chick. I loved Bandu and Hunter, and Bandu is a *motherly* version of the lancer, which is a fun twist on that character archetype. Hunter is surprisingly reserved and sensitive for the big guy, and I connected with both of these characters. As the smart guy, Criton drives a lot of the plot because it's heavily based in questing for new mythology. Out of all of the characters, Pheadra is the least developed. I feel her arc never came to completion (sequel?). I can't get out of talking about characters without mentioning Psander, the wizard who owns Silent Hall. Psander never came into focus as a character for me, and she mostly serves as a plot device. The main five are strong enough that it doesn't matter that much. \n The plot moves fast, and you're constantly deciphering the new mythology that comes along. The mythology focuses on the gods and the barriers between the worlds. I was as frustrated as the characters were not to learn more or know more. The obscurification felt almost too purposeful in some parts of the story, and some explanation on how magic works was sorely needed. The most exciting part of the novel focuses around the elves, who are not the friendly, fairy creatures of folklore. They're strong warriors and gather their powers from an evil tree. We do find out--fairly quickly, too--how the elves powers work and why they work. I think that made that part of the story more concrete and helped propel the action. \n The weakest part of Silent Hall is how Psander and her missions feel underdeveloped. They're basically fetch quests, and while the five characters have emotional reasons for wanting them to happen, it's never explained why Psander's magic works. This does hurt part of the ending of the book. \n Notes: \n I couldn't stop thinking of 'narking' every time I read Narky. I have no idea if this was intentional on the author's part. \n The romance plots surprised me. They felt realistic, if not fully developed, and I felt 'sequel' in those unresolved stories. \n I read a lot of fantasy series where people natter about religion this summer. Can't say I particularly enjoyed that aspect of this book. \n Rating: 5 stars. This book wasn't fun, but it was action packed, and I liked all of the characters."}

{"text": "See full review for Thief's Cunning at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n So I wasn't going to read this book when I initially found out about it. I don't like 'companion' books. Especially when it's been a few months since I've read the predecessor. And in Thief's Cunning's case, I didn't really enjoy the first one all that much. But I'm a sucker for finishing things I start (most of the time) and I added it anyway. And let me tell you, I'm kind of glad that I did. \n Don't get me wrong Thief's Cunning still had its issues. While in Assassin's Heart Lea's biggest problem was all her guilt, Thief's Cunning had Allegra and she had two problems. The first is that she wants to be free. Apparently in the life that she currently lives she feels trapped. And I really don't blame her for that notion. Lea and her extended family keep her pretty much housebound except for the odd job. Of course, it took me a while to figure out why - it's been over a year since I read Assassin's Heart - and when I did I had a head slapping moment. Duh."}

{"text": "Wow. I just finished reading this, I started a few hours ago on a whim and was literally unable to put it down since. The need to keep going even pushed me through the notes at the end and half of the free chapter of Laura's wolf that's included before my need to review overwhelmed me. \n This has intricate world building, not just werewolves but not white werewolves who have werewolf customs but also keep the culture they emigrated from. Not just super senses but an overdeveloped need for social touching that makes shifters uncomfortable around non shifters, which are, to my great delight given an outsider name (being that if being a werewolf is perfectly normal for you and yours, you wouldn't go around calling regular humans just \"normal\" or non werewolves.). One bodied is a great description, too, from the perspective of someone for whom shifting is a natural and everyday ability. The concept that becoming a werewolf if you weren't one would fuck you up massively is also one that I found resonated with many of my own theories and the author gives just enough information to make you want to know a little more (I'm looking forward to reading Laura's wolf and seeing how Roy handles the situation). \n Both protagonists were interesting in their own right, although DJ is a bit more tridimensional on account of not having grown up in a lab. \n *BIT OF A SPOILER* \n I enjoyed the tension between them a lot, too, although perhaps I would have argued for an unhappier ending to be more in line with Echo's personality and obvious desensitization, I can buy that everybody will eventually snap."}
{"text": "When last we saw Aniri, she was due to marry Ash, Prince of Jungali, in a week. Her mother and eldest sister have arrived in Bhatki, Jungali's capital city, for the wedding and Aniri had iceberg feet. She's barely 18, and unsure that she could make a good Queen--let alone a good wife. Plus, she fears that her affection for Ash was the product of their adventure together. She knows he's a good man--Aniri feels a bit...unworthy. \n Then, on the eve of their wedding, Aniri's pregnant sister, Seledri survives an assassination attempt and Aniri takes Ash's skyship to Samir (with Ash's permission yet against his reservations) to \"visit\" Seledri; even Aniri's maid Priya and her personal guard Janak know Aniri's planning to remove Seledri. Why not? There are serious rumors that Samir is planning to invade Aniri's homeland Dharia--which would put Seledri at greater risk. \n Arriving in Samir, Aniri finds the situation more dire than she expected--her sister's husband is in a battle for the throne with his younger brother and Seledri is a pawn in the struggle. Aniri gets unexpected help from her former \"lover\" Devesh and and a person she hasn't seen in eight long years, both of whom have questionable loyalty. \n Still, they are able to rescue Seledri--not without casualties--and the return to Jungali should be triumphant. It is not. Aniri made some key mistakes in the mission, and Ash is ready to send her back to Dharia unwed. Her intelligence gained--that Samir likely has an armada of skyships--hastens Ash's defensive plans, and his efforts to get Aniri far from danger. And out of his country. Of course, Aniri's fickle heart had finally decided that Ash was The One....had been ready to pledge herself wholeheartedly, until he didn't want her. \n But, the best things in life are worth fighting for, and Aniri's a spirited girl. She makes amends the best she can, proclaiming Ash's worth to his people and rousing the Jungalis for the looming battle. Will it be enough to win him back? \n Maybe. I'll tell you now, the book ends with a heavy cliffhanger, but not regarding Aniri and Ash--their feelings are made plain before the book ends. Unfortunately, their romance is still on hold as Bhakti faces the first wave of Samirian aggression and Aniri has an even bigger battle on her hands... \n Oh! I just CANNOT wait for the conclusion of this series! The tension has been great. Aniri's mix of undecidedness over marriage and resolution to save her loved ones is a great back-and-forth. She is young and headstrong and courageous and foolish. Her imperfections remind us of those parts we see in ourselves, undoubtedly. She has only known Ash two weeks--that's kinda short for a commitment like marriage, and her natural reluctance is refreshing. She isn't a gal prone to instalove, but wants a lasting connection to her partner. All respectable ideals. \n And Ash is very compelling. Far more so than Devesh, though that guy has come out better in this tale than the first one. Either way, Aniri's got a lot to do next book to reunite with her love, and save Dharia and Jungali from war."}
{"text": "\"Il regno dei gufi\" e il primo volume di una saga, una trilogia per essere precisi, che purtroppo non e piu in commercio. Dico \"purtroppo\" perche quello che mi sono ritrovata tra le mani e un vero e proprio gioiello, un libro nel quale mi sono imbattuta per pura fortuna e che credo mi rimarra sempre nel cuore. \n Questo romanzo narra una storia complessa e articolata in due parti, che potrebbero ricondursi rispettivamente ai periodi della giovinezza e della maturita del protagonista, il giovane Gufo dei Granai, Hunter. Egli riceve una precisa ed accorata istruzione dai suoi genitori, i quali gli insegnano a vivere nel mondo della campagna, trasmettendogli i valori derivanti dalla religione e dalla societa dei Gufi dei Granai. L'autore rende i Gufi molto simili a noi esseri umani: essi hanno una struttura sociale ben definita, hanno un Credo ben preciso e delle regole da rispettare per poter far parte della comunita, ma non solo: i piccoli Gufi dei Granai ricevono un'istruzione di base - che li portera ad apprendere lezioni importanti quali il volo, la caccia, la paura e l'importanza della famiglia - e un'istruzione superiore. Durante quest'ultima fase, i giovani Gufi vengono presi sotto l'ala di un insegnante esperto, che li istruira sulla materia per la quale si sentono piu portati, come per esempio la Storia, la Geografia, l'Ecologia, la Gufologia, la Religione, la Poesia, la Guerra, le Lingue, le Scienze Umane... \n Il lettore viene da subito catapultato nel mondo dei rapaci notturni, e imparera insieme ad Hunter i valori e le regole della comunita dei Gufi dei Granai. Egli cresce nel granaio dei suoi genitori, e fin dai primi mesi di vita dimostra un vivo interesse per la conoscenza. Quando arriva il suo momento di imparare la lezione piu dura, e cioe l'indipendenza e l'allontanamento dal nido familiare, Hunter si ritrova da solo a vagare per i cieli notturni illuminati dalla pallida luna, alla ricerca della sua nuova dimora e del Gufo che potra impartirgli un'istruzione superiore. Le cose purtroppo non vanno esattamente come egli aveva previsto, e si ritrova cosi a dover sopravvivere da solo senza ricevere alcun insegnamento da nessuno, se non dagli animali che popolano il territorio in cui si e stanziato. Inizialmente diffidente e schivo, Hunter impara ben presto il valore della tolleranza e dell'uguaglianza fra le specie. La sua curiosita, sensibilita e sete di conoscenza, lo spingeranno cosi a voler creare un'unione tra le tre razze di Gufi esistenti, e cioe quelli dei Granai, quelli delle Foreste e gli immigranti. Riuscira nel suo intento quando un Gufo Reale minaccera la sopravvivenza dei Gufi, ma scomparsa la sua minaccia ne arrivera un'altra, piu pericolosa e incombente di prima: l'uomo, e insieme ad esso l'inquinamento proveniente dalle citta, nonche la comparsa di un nuovo Gufo dei Granai che intende sovvertire l'intero ordine sociale della comunita che Hunter conosceva fin da pulcino. \n Un libro intriso di significati, ricco di avvenimenti e pervaso da un incessante senso di malinconia e nostalgia, che avviluppera il lettore come una nebbiolina leggera, accompagnandolo durante tutta la lettura. \n Il linguaggio usato da Martin Hocke e spesso ricercato, con termini tratti dalla filosofia e dalla religione, e a tratti si fa piu poetico e solenne. Lo stile dell'autore e particolare, nostalgico e malinconico. La narrazione procede piuttosto velocemente, complice il fatto che la trama sia fitta di avvenimenti anche molto ravvicinati tra loro. Sebbene il romanzo ci metta un po' ad ingranare, riesce a spiccare il volo e a tenere il lettore col fiato sospeso. \n \"Il regno dei gufi\" appartiena al genere fantasy, ma si tratta di un fantasy atipico, poiche qui non sono presenti elementi soprannaturali ne creature magiche. Il libro e ambientato ai giorni nostri, in un luogo imprecisato del mondo reale. \n Per quanto riguarda le descrizioni, sono dettagliate quelle delle battaglie e dei sentimenti che animano i Gufi, un po' meno curate quelle riguardanti l'aspetto dei personaggi e dei luoghi. \n Nonostante i personaggi della storia non siano pochi, l'autore riesce a dare ad ognuno di loro un carattere diverso, seppure il loro background ci risulti quasi del tutto sconosciuto. Ogni personaggio ha un ruolo ben preciso all'interno della storia, nessuno e superfluo o fine a se stesso. Ho amato molto Hunter, il protagonista di questo libro, sincero e coraggioso, mosso da ideali puri, impulsivo, testardo e curioso. Attraverso i suoi occhi il lettore imparera a vedere le cose da un punto di vista diverso da quello a cui e abituato, vivra le sue paure, condividera i suoi dolori e i suoi successi con grande coinvolgimento emotivo. Mi e piaciuta anche l'evoluzione che ha subito il protagonista durante lo svolgersi della storia, evoluzione che permette al libro di essere considerato a tutti gli effetti un romanzo di formazione. \n Sebbene \"Il regno dei gufi\" rientri nella categoria dei fantasy per ragazzi, per via dei temi in esso trattati potrebbe benissimo essere annoverato tra i migliori romanzi per adulti. Questo libro infatti offre spunti di riflessione non indifferenti; lo scrittore ha disseminato tra le sue pagine temi quali l'uguglianza e il razzismo, l'ambientalismo e l'ecologia, l'odio e l'amore, la scienza e la spiritualita, la conoscenza, il rispetto, il fanatismo, l'amicizia, la sessualita, la responsabilita, il sacrificio, la lealta, la memoria, la speranza... tutte tematiche importanti, che vengono analizzate profondamente dall'autore, con evidente intento didascalico. \n La trama si presenta ben intessuta e ben studiata da Hocke. Gli avvenimenti che in essa si svolgono sono volti a lanciare un messaggio al lettore; la storia di Hunter vuole insegnarci a riconoscere le cose che davvero hanno importanza nella nostra vita di esseri umani, facendoci notare la caducita dei beni terreni e l'essenza effimera delle cose che noi spesso riteniamo importanti. \"Il regno dei gufi\" altro non e una metafora della vita e della storia dell'uomo e facilmente il lettore ne ravvisera le innumerevoli similitudini. \n Nell'ultima edizione, al romanzo e stato scelto di cambiare il titolo, che originariamente era \"L'antico Regno del Silenzio\". Anche la traduzione del testo e cambiata, e in questa versione i Barbagianni, chiamati anche Gufi Bianchi nelle prime edizioni, sono divenuti i Gufi dei Granai. Gli Allocchi, chiamati anche Gufi Bruni, sono diventati semplicemente Gufi delle Foreste, e infine le Civette sono divenute Gufi Piccoli o Immigranti. Inutile dire che preferisco di gran lunga la traduzione precedente, a mio parere piu immediata e genuina. \n Mi sento di consigliare questo libro a tutti, nessuno escluso. Certo e che \"Il regno dei gufi\" si rivolge ad un pubblico maturo, sia per i termini utilizzati che per le tematiche affrontate, profonde ed importanti. Consiglio in particolar modo questo libro a chi ama la Natura, alle persone sensibili e a chi desidera una lettura che lascera il segno. In questo romanzo si trovano tutti gli ingredienti di una bella storia: avventura, amore, eroismo... quindi, perche non leggerlo? ;)"}
{"text": "Some things about this book were amazing. I started reading and couldn't put it down. The pacing was perfect, the plot well structured. It was a seat of your pants, high stakes read, all of which I absolutely loved. \n Other things left me wanting more, like the relationship between Calla and Ren. Cremer does a good job of showing their physical chemistry, the way Ren feels about Calla, and the pressures both these characters have as alphas. What I wished there had been more of, any of, actually--were one or two good flashbacks where I could glimpse the kind of \"relationship\" these two had growing up as \"friends.\" \n I mean, with Shay it's understandable that we don't know much about his past. The boy is new to Calla's life and because the story is told from her POV, they have no history she can think about besides saving him from the Grisly. But if Ren and Calla grew up together, you'd think there's be lots of history to draw from, stuff that Cremer could have used to help us better understand Calla's feelings toward Ren. \n Carrie Ryan does this in her book, \"Forest of Hands and Teeth,\" in the midst of bloodshed, fear, and zombies destroying the world. I found myself moved to tears by the scene where Mary and the boy she's supposed to marry, but doesn't love, are tied together in preparation for their union, because he is so kind to her. In Nightshade, though, there was a lot of time spent on physical chemistry and not as much on the emotional chemistry between Calla and Ren. \n In fairness, Cremer did give us a few tender moments with Ren, like the one where he healed Calla. Then again, that one seemed to serve a double purpose, as it showed the kind of relationship the Guardians had with the Keepers. \n This is a great read if you want to explore the implications of blind loyalty. It's thought provoking and Cremer does a good job of showing us how the pack relates to each other, how they're like a family, how tradition is used to control. There's so much good about this book, I'd recommend it to just about anyone."}
{"text": "I had tried reading this years ago and had a hard time with it - this time I read it in three days :) This sequel to Dune takes place not long after that seminal work, with Paul and Alia at the head of the new Imperium. I was surprised when reading this how tight Herbert's writing was. It was a quick read because Herbert didn't waste time on details that weren't germaine to the moment, which might put off some readers. If Kyle MacLachlan pops in your head when you think Paul Atreides, approach with caution. This Maud'Dib is a ruler, stuck with all of the problems and dilemmas a super powered emperor with a wife, mistress, and a back from the dead friend would expect to face."}
{"text": "This is the second book in a series, and really should be read in order. \n Thad and Sara are getting used to being a couple, planning a quiet, somewhat cheerful Christmas at Thad's home in the bayou. Though a nominal Hindu, Sara's parents celebrated a secular \"American\" Christmas, and he's a little homesick missing his family. Thing is, weird lights are appearing in the mist, and leading people out into the murk. It even grabs hold of Thad, who (as a vampire) is totally light-sensitive, but it doesn't affect Sara for unknown reasons. As such, Sara is a super important part of the investigation, which irks Thad--he wants Sara to stay home, be safe. \n So this novella packs a lot of emotional punch. We see how Thad's emotionally dependent on Sara, and that's really endearing. They're also working on their intimacy, which Sara loves and Thad's trying not to treat as if it's sinful. Hard for him what with being raised that way. \n ...I half carried him upstairs to our bed. \n Our bed. \n The bed I would share with him as long as he'd have me. Though at times my inner conflict still raged, Sara was a sin I couldn't help but commit. \n #Swoon, really. Because what's more romantic than completely setting aside your biased, yet ingrained, religious beliefs to embrace love. \n This mystery unfolds slowly, but has a big wallop of conflict. The \"natives\" aren't happy about outsiders in the bayou, and are quick to blame the witch lights--visions of light that naturally appear and are dismissed as \"swamp gas\" but are instead serving as a beacon--on Thad, as he's such a recluse that many feel he could be a malevolent force. Some of the townsfolk try to intimidate him into leaving. Then, a young girl goes missing and it's pretty much torches and pitchforks time. \n All of this is happening alongside the Christmas season, and the festive spirit that Sara's trying to cultivate is dimmed by the mounting mystery. The climax is intense, with Thad and Sara combing the bayou for the missing girl, and the source of magic behind the light-beacons. I really enjoyed this, and loved that Thad embraced his human roots more. The affection growing between Thad and Sara is delightful, and I just can't wait to read more of their adventures."}
{"text": "This is a revised work originally published as Notturno. \n Adin Tredeger is a scholar of rare erotic manuscripts and has just won the priceless 500 y/o Notturno manuscript at auction. Notturno is the first recorded book detailing an erotic homosexual relationship, and Adin is captivated by the deeply passionate story of the two lovers. Adin doesn't actually believe love exists, but the heartbreaking story of Niccolo and Auselmo's forbidden love is changing Adin's mind. \n Especially so when Adin meets Donte (nee Niccolo) in the, um, flesh. Turns out the wages of Niccolo's sin was not death, but un-death. He was turned into a vampire (now called Donte), and forced to exist for centuries without his precious Auselmo. Notturno was his personal diary and he guarded it carefully, but it was confiscated with all his other art in the Nazi invasion of France and kept hidden for decades. When it was up for auction Donte's bidding was tampered, resulting Adin claiming the book. But Donte will not rest until his diary is returned, and he's willing to seduce, or sacrifice, Adin in order to get Notturno back. \n This was an interesting read, for sure. The vampire element was cool, especially when we had two factions of vampires searching for the book. Adin hadn't considered the possibility of vamps existing, and suddenly he's caught between Donte and Donte's nemesis, another vamp who wants Notturno destroyed. I really enjoyed how Adin bonded with Donte. Donte claims over and over that he cannot love, that his ability to love was killed with Auselmo, but Adin is a patient man. Through his translations of Notturno, Adin sees the deep capacity for love that Niccolo/Donte had as a man, and he's willing to prove to Donte that love like that never dies. Over the course of several months, and several near-death experiences, Adin recognizes that life really is hollow without love--and having a true love, even with a vampire, is worth dying for. \n Spoiler alert, no men were killed in the course of reading this book. (Though some vamps do get staked.) I wished for a little more heat in the smexytimes, but that's a small quibble. I didn't read the first edition of this book, but NetGalley provided this copy for my honest review."}

There were moments where I just wanted to slap Darcy for being so......Darcy. Something about her just bugs the crap out of me. I don't know what it is but I didn't like her. I enjoyed Lizzie's story much more than Darcy's. \n I feel as though that this story could have been more developed character wise but it was an interesting premise. \n I'm not saying this is a bad book, I guess it just wasn't for me."}
{"text": "Save time and watch it on stage, where they leave out the more twisted, weird parts and you leave feeling good. I regretted the time spent reading this."}
{"text": "So this book was a big surprise for me. I was pretty sure I was going to like it. Isn't that why we read what we read? But I didn't just like this book, I really liked it. It was far from perfect, but it was kinda awesome. \n The book is written from Mina Murray's point of view. She is still grieving over the loss of her father at the hands of what she doesn't quite want to admit to herself was a vampire(s) during her time in Transylvania. She's decided to leave that life behind. She has a job teaching on the sketchier side of London, and it's a job she enjoys. She is engaged to Johnathan Harker (I'll get to him later) and wants to live a normal life. Enter Abe, aka Abraham Van Helsing, who she was at one point madly in love with and engaged. He tells her that vampires are a very real threat and that he and his friend at Scotland Yard need her help. Mina wants nothing to do with it, or him and her obviously unresolved feelings for him. She just wants to marry Johnathan and quite frankly, be left alone. That's all well and good until vampires attack a ball and kidnap Johnathan. She can no longer ignore that vampires are real and she is determined to get Johnathan back. So, Mina joins Abe, his friend Arthur, Arthur's recently turned vampire wife (they mostly keep her sedated), and Seward from Scotland Yard on a trip to Transylvania to save Johnathan and hopefully defeat whoever took him. I'm going to stop there on the plot synopsis to keep it as spoiler-free as possible. \n The plot was imaginative and the writing was fairly well done. It felt a little stilted in the beginning. At times it seemed like the sentences were needlessly complicated but eventually, it didn't bother me. Maybe I just got used to the style of writing. I did have a little trouble following how much of book was taking a page out of Dracula lore and how much wasn't. Eventually, I got over that too and decided not to compare so much. Just let it go and enjoy. \n I also want to add that two things I was not expecting happened in this book. \n 1)I actually got a little scared a few times. Like heart-pounding-white-knuckle-holding my kindle kinda scared. I was really surprised. \n 2)I might have teared up at one point. One part might have been incredibly tragic and sad. Maybe. There, I said it. Moving on. \n Mina was a little frustrating. She seemed to constantly overestimate herself. It wasn't that she was TSTL, it was that she was forever putting herself in harm's way when she had no reason to really assume that she could protect herself. Carrying a knife does not in any way make someone strong enough to win a fight with a supernatural being. Especially when she knows exactly zilch about them. How fast, how strong, etc. She pretty much walked around announcing that she would be fine, she was carrying a knife. And somehow, it always seemed to work out for her. I mean, I'm glad it did, but still. At least she was smart and had a good head on her shoulders. \n Abe was just delicious. He was the Rhett Butler to her annoyingly perfect and milquetoasty Johnathan. This is the only part of the book that really bothered me. The entire plot revolved around Johnathan's kidnapping, and honestly, I didn't care if he was ever rescued. He is just this lovely, patient, kind, loving man and yet he just bothered the hell out of me. Go away, Ashley. No one wants you here. I mean, I should have liked him, I suppose. But I didn't. \n I get that he is necessary, no need for a rescue, no plot. I just didn't understand her feelings for him. I wish we would have had some time in her head for an explanation other than \"because he's nice and I love him\". Because I mean, girl. Come on. Abe. There really wasn't even that much really said about Abe. We learn a great deal about the kind of man he is, but it wasn't like a romance novel where there are passages dedicated to the poetry of his face and body. There was just this thing abut him. Forbidden. Adventurous. Masculine. Protective. Every time he was around, I was like, \n Overall, I thought this book was such fun. I just love historical-fantasy of any kind. This book just scratched allll the right spots. Fantasy. A little horror. Some romance. Throw in some mystery and you have a pretty awesome book. And I couldn't be happier that this is a series. I will read them all, happily. \n *ARC generously provided by the author in exchange for a fair and honest review."}
{"text": "I jumped on this book based on the recommendations, but I wasn't in love with the execution. \n It's an epic fantasy about superbeings who live amongst us human on Earth, but the verbose descriptions between the human realm and the Ahe'ey were exhausting, to me. The complete collection here was about 200,000 words, and I think we could have done without a third of them. Plus, honestly, I was put off by the mundanity of it all. When I'm reading Fantasy, I want to be transported. I don't want the dialogue to sound like a contemporary YA/MG story. \n The battles between the castes seemed forced, and the \"drama\" of this life-and-death arrangement also didn't make sense to me. I'm not a big women's studies genre reader, because I'm all about the romance, and this didn't draw me to the cause, I must say. It felt very formulaic, and I didn't connect with any of the myriad characters as a result. The pace bogged, like I mentioned, with large chunks of dense description which damped my interest right quick. The lackluster dialogue sealed Ahe-ey's fate, for me. \n I think, for people who really love Fantasy and descriptive literature, you might find this intriguing."}

{"text": "Teen fiction is SO much better than it used to be (way back in the day when I was walking to school barefoot and uphill both ways). And this series, written by a mother and daughter team, is exceptional. It's a new twist on vampirism, with a high school/finishing school for teenagers going through \"the change\". Typical teenagers in many ways, they are portrayed as smart, active, interested in school and in the future, which is a lovely counterpoint to much of what is said about teenagers today. The story moves and grows at such a fast pace it is very difficult to put the book down--and not to jump immediately in to the next book in the series. Stephanie Meyer fans will LOVE this series as well."}

It started to seem very juvenile but then I got caught up in the story and I was the juvenile and I couldn't wait to turn the pages."}
{"text": "This is a fun YA spin on contemporary mythology. The gods of Greece still rule from afar and their sired children, demigods, walk amongst the mortals. They are not many in number, and are often collected into conservatories in order to keep them safe from Skia, the spawn of Hades who hunt them and bring them to the Underworld. All of society understands that gods exist, or did, and kids learn Mythology as a regular subject in school. Much like the demigods of yore, monsters of myth live, too. \n Hope is trapped in a curse that spans thousands of years. Her grandmother was the famed Sphinx at Thebes, and each female offspring is immortal, a monster and untouchable by any other than Apollo or his sons. Hope's mother fell for a mortal and sealed the curse of Apollo-and was punished for it. Orphaned and alone at age 16, Hope must find a way to survive her curse, and also society. She moves to a small town in eastern Washington and endeavors to get past her grief. \n It's not easy. She has plenty of money, thanks to her grandmother's golden treasure, but she's never been on her own. She knows she should keep moving, running from the Skia that she sees with more and more regularity, but she has managed to make friends for the first time in her life. Plus, being a vagabond brings another element of vulnerability that Hope cannot truly contend with. \n Athan, a new student in school seems to charm everyone-except Hope. She's upset with the world, though, and his sympathy eventually allows him access to her isolated realm. Expect the usual high school cattiness. I liked how Hope stood up for herself, and attempted to right wrongs. Her grief was deep, and her world so sheltered. She's not sure what to do with the growing feelings she has for Athan, but she's not willing to tell him her true secret. When she learns he's a demigod her brief respite must end. She's got to get on the road. Now. Or, so she thinks. \n I really liked all the supernatural elements of this one. The prose is a mostly effortless read with plenty of tension scattered throughout. Athan's a swaggering boy, but he drops that act once he gets to know Hope. He could never have guessed her true nature, but he handles the big secret very, very well. It's not ideal for him to love Hope, mostly because his father, Hermes, has some big plans to use Hope as a frustration to Apollo. That said, Athan acts honorably. This is a bit of YA romance, but it's completely clean and age-appropriate. Well, if you don't count the violence. For some reason violence is far more acceptable behavior for teens than sexytimes, but I digress. \n All-in-all, the plot is interesting, Hope's big secret is different from one I've read before, and the book ends with new trouble on the horizon. So expect a MILD cliffhanger because the next book seems to be a completely new adventure for Hope. Not a problem for me, as this is a series I'd gladly dive into."}

{"text": "What can I say? I thought this book was wonderful, and I was very sorry when it eventually came to an end. I know some reviewers here are disappointed that we never actually learn that much about the fairy realm that is often alluded to, but to me that's the the point-- such things are unknowable and can only be understood at all by putting aside the rational mind and accepting them as given. I've seen other people use the word \"ineffable\" to describe this book, and I think it's very apt. \n The one part of the book that took some time to wrap my head around was the big time jump that takes place around the middle of the book. The story is always zigging and zagging between flashbacks that take place in different periods of the past, but the \"present-day\" of the story suddenly jumps ahead twenty years at one point, and it's up to the reader to piece together what has happened, both to our main family and to the world in general, in the meantime. What's more amazing to me is that, if we accept the beginning of the story to take place in Crowley's present-day as he was writing in the late 1970's (and I think there is textual evidence to support this), and accounting for the time that has passed in the story before the time jump, then the future that it jumps ahead to is roughly our now. Fortunately, our world is not quite as bleak as the future that Crowley imagined, but I'm amazed at the small throwaway details that he got right, such as the existence of urban farms and the cancellation of many soap operas. (I would never have predicted either of those things, but Crowley somehow did.) \n This is the kind of book where you go on a journey with the characters and the story is more about the getting there than the place they eventually arrive. If you are willing to go along with the Drinkwater family as they meander through the late 20th century, you will not be disappointed."}

The writing is bad, it moves along at a nice pace, which is why the novel got the stars it got. My problem with it is I spent the first quarter of the novel thinking I'd heard this story, or something similar to it, before - and I had, in Stephen King's short \"The Night Flyer.\" The rest of the novel read like a loose modernization of the classic Brahm Stoker, which for a vampire novel isn't unexpected, but still, I'd been hoping for something a little more. You can definitely see Del Toro's influence in the vignettes that are interspersed through the novel, which are very movie-like in their quick glimpses.

{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n \"Eon\", the first book of this series, did a fantastic job of givingthe reader glimpses of something deeper to the story, then taunting usby keeping it a foot out of reach. Does the sequel live up to the first volume? \n For the most part, yes. \"Eona\" is the counter to it's predecessor, aconstant torrent of action and motion that rapidly drives the readerto the conclusion, which is really a shame. So many authors these days seem to perpetuate a series long past the point it should have ended, dragging their readership along because, as readers, they've already invested so much into it. If anything, though, Alison Goodman doesn't draw the story out long enough. \n This sequel begins hot on the tail of the first book. Eona has just realized the truth of her dragon, but she is still untrained. Sethon has named himself emperor, and Eona's only hope at mastering herselfand her power lies in Ido, the Dragoneye responsible for all of the destruction. \"Eona\" dashes off from there, as Kygo struggles to secure the empire from his uncle, while Eona learns the secret of both her ancestor and the String of Pearls. Along the way, Eona learns what sheneeds to. \n Goodman does too good a job though - even as we narrow in on the final pages, you can't help but wish there was another volume or three to the story. I don't believe we ever got a satisfactory answer about the compass, and Goodman's world is certainly rich enough that you want to spend more time in it. If you enjoyed Eon, you'll enjoy this conclusion."}

It's a tense, page turner which starts slow and then builds momentum ending with a race against the clock, action orientated finale. And what about her nemesis Juneau Malloy - can she really trust him? In this episode, she has no choice than to try. \n ^^ The characters are well fleshed out, and there's relationships a plenty. I previously mentioned possible GBLT themes in previous books, which there are; a nice touch in a young adult, Sci-Fi book. \n ^^ I also really like the world and settings, Taylor Brooke has created. She has a brilliant imagination. \n ^^ Apart from the fact that you'll miss two great stories, I definitely recommend reading both the previous books in this series, so you have a good idea of all the characters and can really get to grips with what's been going on so far. Plus it's fun to see how each character changes, after what Taylor Brooke has put them through. \n Overall: This whole series is definitely worth a read.

{"text": "It's hard to talk about The Golden Compass and not simply gush effusively. \n So, let's get that out of the way. \n The Golden Compass is one of the most fantastic and compelling starts to any fantasy series ever and OH MY GOD why are you not reading this book RIGHT NOW? \n In all seriousness, the dialogue between Pullman and Lewis is incredible, and it's hard not to take Pullman's side entirely. Lyra is a remarkable protagonist with who is a perfect blend of flaws and strengths, and her relationship with her daemon, Pan, is so realistic and comforting that every time I stopped reading I kept looking for my own daemon. \n Pullman blends fantastical elements with mundane ones expertly, and even when we're being taken to lands with talking polar bears, everything is presented so authoritatively that it feels true rather than real. The characters are complicated, the morality is full of greyscale, and none of the decisions are easy, for the characters or for the readers. \n And that's why it's important. \n In fantasy, we often rely on good and evil being very black and white concepts, but to actively play with these constructs and show that that's all they are, constructs, is brilliant. In Pullman's world, self-knowledge is king, and the only true evil is to deny your own nature. \n So, great fantasy series? Or greatEST fantasy series?"}
{"text": "This ARC was obtained at BEA14, in exchange for an honest review. \n 9th&up \n In the town where teenage siblings Hazel and Ben live, the Fae have always been an accepted part of life; harmless to the locals who know the rules and dangers associated with the \"good neighbors\", and only occasionally treacherous to the tourists who foolishly seek a brush with otherworldly creatures. Recently, however, the unspoken pact between the people of Fairfold and the Fae community has frayed and Hazel finds herself taking a central role in the battle of might and wits that ensues. \n Holly Black is a storyteller after my own heart and she is definitely one of my go-to YA authors. I adore the way she combines everyday life with the seductive yet sinister world of the Fae, and how she weaves fairy lore (changelings, redcaps and more) with dark versions of the tales I remember from children's books (such as Sylvester and the Magic Pebble and Tops and Bottoms). \n The twists and turns of the story, the flawed but likable characters, and the rich world Black creates all work together perfectly, and the result is a novel that is sure to appeal to any teen that likes a little spice with their fantasy novels."}

The Whispers scratches the surface of supernatural, thriller and suspense; so if you like such genre I do recommend it, especially since at the end of this novelette you can read an exclusive preview of Lisa Unger's next thriller: CRAZY LOVE YOU (which sounds amazing!!).

{"text": "Facebook.com/TheBooknatics \n My Book Blog: http://thebooknatic.wordpress.com/ \n --There are so many negative remarks about this novel not having a plot, that I feel I should add this to my review incase people are overlooking this book because of such reviews... But, please remember, this is only an opinion.... \n I can see how some may say they don't see the plot here, but I beg to differ. I feel this book contained more than just a magical world, something much deeper than your average plot of a book; it shined to life a magical depth of the meaning of love, in all forms. The tone was very enchanting, poetic, and colorful even despite the black and white theme. It takes a very devoted reader who is passionate of literature to understand the depth of layers of this story and has a capable mind to dissect between the lines. In my humble opinion, I believe Morgenstern broke out of the cliche style of writing, and gave us something so brilliant and excellent enough to be an instant classic read. It makes me so sad to see how many negative things are being said about this novel! But in the end, I know we all have our own opinions, and I haven't seen too many positive remarks on this, so I felt the need to express my two cents. This book will remain a favorite on my top shelf at home for ages to come. \n ------------- \n This novel is set in the late 1800's to early 1900's in a classical yet dark and enigmatic tone. Erin Morgenstern feeds your imagination with vivid pictures with words that cast you into an unknown and exciting world. \n The gist of this story is that two young illusionists were trained by rivaled senior Illusionists -to \"compete\" in a \"game\"- since childhood. The two children were never told who their competitor was, nor did they know when the \"game\" would start, or which venue, but were only told, \"You will know when the time comes, and you will compete till there is only one left...\" Never did they imagine would they fall in love in the midst of a mysterious circus... \n Though the reading did give me some Tim Burton vibes and reminds me slightly of The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, it's a completely original story and unlike anything I have ever read. \n I feel this book contained more than just a magical world, something much deeper than your average plot of a book; it shined to life a magical depth of the meaning of love, in all forms. The tone was very enchanting, poetic, and colorful even despite the black and white theme. I believe Morgenstern broke out of the cliche style of writing, and gave us something so brilliant and excellent enough to be an instant classic read. I am in love with this book, and dare I say I'd love to see this as a series."}

{"text": "Audiobook narrated by Amanda C. Miller \n The Wizard of OZ: A Steampunk Adventure is a good, well rounded story that was interesting the whole way through. I wasn't sure what to expect from a steampunk take on The Wizard of Oz but Stuart manages to make clever nods toward different aspects of the classic when turning OZ into a massive steampunk prison. The steampunk aspects of the story are incorporated well and not over the top. \n Stuart does a great job of making this a steampunk adventure that isn't crazy over the top. A lot of steampunk seems to go so over the top that it's hard to follow what's going on but that isn't the case here. This is clearly a steampunk adventure that is not trying to be some kind of big budget movie. There are guns, swords, airships, combat, automatons, and borderline magical science all at work here. There is also a healthy amount of dueling, betraying, and double crossing in here too. One minor thing that I didn't like as much (and is fairly common to steampunk) is the amount of betraying - it was a little difficult to follow some characters' motivations and betrayals at times because of all the double crossing going on. \n Turning OZ into a prison worked out great. Since I know the story of OZ already, I kept linking pieces from this story to the classic and found that it actually works out well, even the lessons learned by the characters in the end. The story was interesting without dragging too much. The only parts that dragged for me were when some of the characters kept getting locked up in prison (it's like a prison of prisons at times) and they sit around and talk or figure stuff out. \n Amanda C. Miller does a great job as narrator for this novel. She does all the different voices and adds some good snark and attitude to Dorothy when she needs it. I never had trouble understanding her and could usually tell which character was speaking based on the voices she gave them."}

{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars. Derivative is an understatement. In spite of it's occasional originality, this reads more like well-written and highly involved fan fiction. The first half of the book features elaborate yet somehow still underdeveloped world building with the purpose of putting our characters in a position to enter Narnia, err Fillory. That's not to say I didn't enjoy every page, but the plotting felt rushed and contrived: we're 100 pages in and Quentin's already in his third year at magic school? It was almost like reading some episodic series like manga or a graphic novel, but without the graphics, rather than an actual novel. \n I've heard many say they disliked the characters, but I found their snark, occasional nastiness, and relatable ennui to be quite charming. I also loved the rough and raw presentation of the magic, and the fact that it's source and appropriate use are questioned by the characters. \n A great classic this is not, but I'm glad I picked it up and am looking forward to the rest of the series. \n *** \n POST-READING OF SERIES OBSERVATION: Joke's on me. Being derivative is THE POINT. I'm slow on the uptake :). And while I'm still bothered by the speed at which the novel unfolded, the series as a whole is great. I liked each book better than the last, and recommend reading them all together rapid-fire!"}
{"text": "Let me start by saying that Harry Potter is truly a work of (pun intended) magic. I love every book in the series and its one of the few book series that get better with each book...but I have to admit The Goblet of Fire is my least favorite. I like the movie way more then the book. I know fans always say the movie sucked but I dont agree. The fourth book just had too many side stories for my liking. She would build you up and then stall you for eight chapters before picking up again. Yes it all does come around but I feel like the movie just kept it simple cut to the chase and kept the focus on what was important. Yeah as a huge fan of the world Rowling created we want to know everything but I just felt it went too far. But I did love the suspense and how this book was the start of the dark more adult side of the world. The conflicts and scary themes were amazing. All in all Harry Potter is just in one word amazing."}
{"text": "Krymzyn is a story of a boy and a girl, two worlds - literally, a love and above all balance. \n The novel written by B.C. Powell begins with a third person present tense description of what appears to be an initiation of a young girl; one set to embark on a destiny never before seen in the land of Krymzyn. \n The novel shifts to the perspective of Chase, a young boy of twelve, who sees the girl during a seizure, which he learns is caused by a tumour. He is told such 'visions' of places and people are nothing but 'hallucinations' because of his tumour, yet Chase cannot help but believe that place called Krymzyn is real. Once the tumour is out, he stops going there. \n Years later, he gets another tumour and following another seizure and he goes back to Krymzyn. He later connects that only through his seizures - and tumours - can he go to this wondrous world and see the beautiful Sash who stole his heart. \n The people of Krymzyn live their lives in and for balance. Emotions like love, jealousy and hate are alien to them and are considered extremes. When a person dies there, the land calls for another to be 'made' to restore the balance. Each person has a purpose in Krymzyn; no one is idle. \n The novel contains many beautiful imagery and ideas that would do well to be present amongst us on earth - in real life. Moreover, Krymzyn is about colours; Powell uses many colours for vividness and to prepare the reader for the truth that will later be revealed to Chase. \n Most of the novel is written from Chase's perspective; although it varies between past tense narration, as you would write in a diary, and present tense narration when he goes to Krymzyn to give the feeling of immediateness, the now. Chase attempts to convince his family that Krymzyn is a real place with real people; hence the tense used to describe it gives that sense to the reader. \n Character development is evident many characters in the novel, but particularly in the two protagonists Chase and Sash as well as in one of Krymzyn's Disciples, Eval. For Sash, the first time she sees Chase in her vision, she is overwhelmed by all the earthly emotions she experiences. She has no names for such emotions but knows that she is the only one in Krymzyn to have them and experience them. At one point, Sash requests Chase the most difficult explanation of all: \"Explain love to me again.\" \n Chase has to explain the trickiest emotion to a girl who does not even know what smell and taste are. His answer, however, is beautiful: \"It's probably the hardest emotion in my world to describe. Imagine how you felt when your purpose was revealed to you. The excitement you feel when fulfilling your purpose, when you're getting the sap. Then combine that with how you feel when you honour the Sustaining Tree, when you press your face against the trunk. How you feel when you stand on the Tall Hill and see the beauty of Krymzyn. Then add how you felt just a moment ago while watching the children. When you put all of those feelings together for one person and you can't stand to be without that person - it hurts you inside when you're apart - I guess that's how love feels.\" \n As seen with the word 'love' (underlined and italicised), certain words do not translate in Krymzyn, like the earthly emotions as well as curse words, sarcasm and words like 'family', 'parents', and many others. It is an interesting technique that makes the reader wonder how Chase is going to explain certain things. It also shows the tremendous effort taken by the author to create such an intricate and different world. \n I'm not sure if it was intended, but for me, the name 'Chase' is significant as it shows how he chases his dreams in Krymzyn, despite everyone telling him that they are mere hallucinations and figments of his imagination. He also seeks to make these dreams a reality. \n Powell has created a new world that stands in strong contrast to earth. Although there is balance, there are no emotions. The people of Krymzyn are often - if not always - expressionless. Their lives are bound by duty and honour to their land. Powell is lauded for his creation, especially as the reader and Chase become dumbfounded by the many apparently impossible equations of maths and physics, which nonetheless hold and act as a strong base. \n Overall, Krymzyn is a beautiful place and book. It is rich in comparisons and makes one thing. Powell is lauded for this quick-paced creation. \n (Worth noting, the novel contains several sensual and adult scenes. While it may be considered Young Adult, I feel it should be read by those aged 18 or over). \n I received a free copy of this book for an honest review through Xpresso Book Tours."}
{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n Gotta say I was more than a little disappointed by this book. Nothing ever seemed to happen. It was much more boring than the other two books because there was like no action or suspense. And the end! Are you kidding me! I had the same complaint about Harry Potter and this may spoil some of the story line for you but I dislike when they make all these problems for the hero but don't have the hero try to fix or work around the problem. Harry Potter lost dumbledore, lost sirius, everyone expected tons from him and yet we are supposed to believe he's this great wizard without even trying. Eragon has soldiers that can't feel pain and what do they do about it? Nothing they just hope that the next group of soldiers they fight can feel pain. RIDICULOUS"}
{"text": "I received a copy of this through a Read2Review so I would like to thank the author as well as my GR group for this opportunity. \n I really enjoyed this story, although it was a bit transparent and I figured out how it would play out, I still found myself liking the story. Personally, I gravitate toward books that have more twists, more surprises. This book really didn't have any, but I didn't struggle to finish it. The overall premise was attractive. Pacing flowed well and editing was done throughly. I felt that the characters were some-what developed and the dynamics between the characters were thought out. The writing was well crafted and descriptive enough to engage myself as the reader into the characters' storylines. \n My biggest gripe is that this story is kinda forgettable. I don't really have anything bad to say about it, but I don't really have anything that I love about it either. All the characters have very specific, sterotypical roles, not a necessarily bad thing, but none of them \"wow-ed\" me. They just really didn't get me 100% invested. I could tell that thought went into the story arc, thought meant to make the storyline appealing to readers, but it also was very, for lack of a better term, boring. I've read versions of that storyline many times. \n I just don't have anything really to say, the whole package just has a certain \"meh\" quality to it. I would have like to see some better developed conflict, character strife?! In my opinion this one just lacked something to make it unique. The romance was sweet, but predictable. The villian was kind of tame. The ending could be seen from a mile away. Even with all its faults, I still enjoyed it. I still think this one will appeal to a lot of readers out there who are fans of paranormal romance."}
{"text": "Ahhh I am so charmed by Liesl and Po! \n I was first delighted by the fairy tale storytelling of Plain Kate by Erin Bow, which I found excellent; Liesl and Po is a book worthy of the same praises. \n Liesl, Po, and Bundle are a quirky trio who are on an adventure together. Pair that with alternating chapters where we meet Will, and you'll be reading long into the night with a huge smile on your face. \n This is a perfect read-aloud for a classroom or family, particularly because of its middle grade classification. The teachers, parents, siblings, and grandparents reading this aloud will be begging to read just one more chapter right along with the children listening. \n A fantastic book by Lauren Oliver. I'm so amazed at how her writing has changed throughout her three novels - what a mark of an excellent author."}

It has a well executed plot, terrific suspense, and an overarching sense of dread and terror I have never experienced in a book previously. It's a book that captures your imagination just to turn it upside down and show you how terrifying it can be. \n Be warned, this book can get very very weird, and I totally rolled with it. But I found there to be a few too many loose ends for my tastes. A few too many teases that never reach fruition. Granted, this is the first part of a trilogy, and there is still a lot of ground to cover. \n Regardless, this is a fiercely original and absolutely compelling read that I wish more people knew about."}
{"text": "Ireland Crane has just taken a job in Tarrytown. She's a high school counselor escaping her former lover--a rich, egotistical, cheating jack wagon named Brantley. So, she's not really keen on a new romance with her delicious landlord/neighbor Noah Van Tassel. They opt for \"friendship\" which is good, because life is about to get very complicated for Ireland. \n Ichabod Crane is looking for a fresh start. Joined by his fellow Revolutionary War veterans, Rip Van Winkle and Washington Irving, Ichabod is set to become schoolmaster in Tarrytown. He's totally attracted to Katrina Van Tassel, but knows he could never woo such a wealthy beautiful girl. Plus, she's spoken for. \n These two stories intersect. When Ichabod and Ireland arrive in Tarrytown so does The Headless Horseman and his fearsome sword and axe. \n Weeks following Ireland's arrival a Van Tassel is killed, the name \"Crane\" carved into his chest. Instant suspect, anyone? And, when Ireland finds a squatter in her home, she's more than freaked. Yes, waking a real-live Rip Van Winkle after a 200+ year sleep would give any modern gal quite a turn. \n Ichabod experiences a different horror--the woman he admires greatly seems to be the target of the Horseman's hunt. Katrina loses her father, her stepmother and a servant, before we learn who is pulling the Horseman's reins--but it is Ichabod's heroism that ends the cycle of violence in his time. \n For Ireland, she's losing time. Periods of it, usually at night, seem to disappear in a haze of night terrors--until Rip finds the cause. Meanwhile, one of Ireland's students is killed, and D-bag Brantley is attacked, too. It soon becomes clear that someone is using Ireland's blood to call the Horseman forth and, before long, Noah's life is on the block. Rip's steadfast desire to save Ireland is only matched by his humor and his narcolepsy--the dude passes out cold whenever he gets spooked leading to some laugh-worthy moments. With Ichabod's history repeating in Ireland's present, can she gain control of the monster within, or will she replace Ichabod in a tragic horrific turn? \n The story is fast-paced and chock full of quick humor--at times I felt like I was reading a Mel Brooks screenplay--all the deadpan digs just cut me up. There are lots of breadcrumbs left behind to be woven into the sequel, RAVEN, but this story ends with a satisfactory resolution. RAVEN will be a new journey, for Ireland, Rip and a love interest. All romantic interludes are conducted behind closed doors, so it's YA-safe..."}

It's too drawn out, and annoying, and I'm tired of Sookie always rehashing her guilt, and then not feeling guilty, and then feeling guilty all over again. SO OVER IT. \n Also, what's up with Alcide showing up naked in Sookie's bed? That was totally random and didn't fit in at all. It seemed like he was only in the story because Charlaine felt the need to write him in -- maybe to please her True Blood fans? She needs to keep the TV plot separate and not interfere with the true storyline. \n It was also disappointing that Sookie & Eric didn't have the same chemistry as before. Their relationship is basically over. Too bad, I was always on Team Eric. Hope she doesn't get back with Bill. \n Anyhow, I'm still a fan of the Sookie series, and hope the next book is better!"}

{"text": "Ever since the popularity of books like the Hunger Games, dystopia YA books have become all the rage. Every writer and publisher seems to be jumping on the bandwagon in hopes of making the next big dystopia novel. \n Unfortunately, I don't see Elemental having the major appeal that Hunger Games had, but I do see it having a slight following mainly due to its rather unique-ish plot element that involves pirates and elemental magic and tons of adventure. \n Elemental's major strength is the constant non-stop action and adventure. There was constant non-stop action literally from about the second or third chapter until the end of the book. The characters were taken on a lengthy boat ride across the bay, there were storms, pirates invading, people dying, and all sorts of things going on. \n One of the benefits of having this non-stop action is that the book constantly moves. There is no real lull in the plot, no part of the book where the plot seems to drag. Instead, readers are quickly moved from one problem to the next without really dwelling on things. I honestly feel that this fast pace for the book works as a major advantage as it's hard to get bored with a book that moves this fast. \n I believe the non-stop action would definitely appeal to anyone who is looking for a fast paced book or anyone looking for lots of action. However, the non-stop action comes at a price - character development. \n I really didn't feel anything for any of the characters. Readers follow the main character, Thomas, throughout the whole book. However, despite Thomas being a constant the whole book I felt nothing for him. This inability to connect with the characters also sort of ruined the romance part of the book. There was romance developing and due to the fact that I didn't seem to know or care about the characters, I didn't care what happened romance wise. \n Another major strength of Elemental that I really feel kept me hooked on the book is the use of pirates. No, these aren't your Jack Sparrow pirates. These are true pirates; Ones that go around scaring people, using intimidation to get their way, and just plain bullies of the sea. I don't know why pirates aren't used more in books, but I think it was a refreshing element that really set Elemental apart from the rest of the books. \n A warning should be given as this entire book is a setup for book 2. In fact, it sort of ends in a cliff-hanger that will leave you waiting for the next book. I \n Overall, Elemental was a delight to read. It was fast paced, filled with action, and had a unique 'elemental magic' twist that really kept me reading until the end. I am hoping the lack of character development is resolved in future books, as I really see potential with the series."}

{"text": "I was surprised about how quickly I read this book. I don't normally go for things that are titled \"UF\" but this was true UF not paranormal romance and I really really liked it. \n Granted I could have done without the long descriptions of clothing and music playing but besides that I thought it was pretty good. Characters were fun especially the convos between Eddi and some of the great characters. There were some really good convos going on in this book. \n This was a bit dated and I don't think this type of story would work in 2010 but I think it's one of those \"trip to the old days\" type book."}
{"text": "I couldn't believe how many people refused to read this book because it was written by Stephenie Meyer, you know.. author of Twilight? Like damn people, harsh much? This was actually a total surprise, it was very well-written and the plot was developed and interesting. I first heard this story when I stumbled upon the movie adaptation on Netflix. After watching it about 3 times from loving it so much, I decided to try the book. Yes, the love story can be sappy like Twilight but this book should no way be compared to Meyer's other works. \n Melanie is one hell of a tough cookie, she does not give up easily and can, at some times, be pretty mean. The one thing I didn't quite understand was that Wanda (Wanderer) was this old experienced soul that had wondered, hence the name, to different lands and planets, yet was so new and confused at some parts of life and functions in the world. Little plot hole there but other than that it was pretty smooth sailing. There of course was a love triangle or square (?). Melanie, Wanda, Jared and Ian. But this wasn't any type of love triangle/square, it was unique and complex considering Melanie and Jared were together prior to having her body taken over. Then, Wanda came along and fell in love with Ian. This complicates things considering Wanda and Melanie are in the same body... What to do with THAT complicated situation lol. Jared was a bit of a jerk towards Wanda, ok fine, a huge jerk. Kind of understandable considering they've never dealt with a nice soul before. Ian actually saw through all of the misconceived perceptions about the souls and saw Wanda as a good being looking to help the humans. For all the little sappy things wrong with the book, the ending does make up for it. It's like Meyer knew she needed some leverage to keep us hanging and wanting a sequel. \n The ending for the book and the movie, again, definitely makes us want a sequel. WHICH has been said to happen, but no current news on it considering Meyer is known to just not go through with novels announced, *cough* *cough* Edward's P.O.V book *cough* *cough* Just saying... She wrapped this up pretty nicely and made us wanting more. \n IF You wanted more, check out more on my blog where I review YA and other genre books. \n http://keepcalmandloveboooks.blogspot.ca"}
{"text": "The Guardians of Ga'Hoole series really takes off with book 3. There's action, adventure and character development all rolled into one. And can I just say, it's got Snowy Owls! I heart snowy owls. \n Now onto my major problem and why this warrents a three star rating and not a four or five. Repetition. Lasky tends to over describe things to the point that I thought I was going crazy because I swear I just read a description that was worded exactly the same way four pages ago. \n While I understand that yes this book is intened for younger audiences there is no need to describe in detail the same exact thing time and time again. \n So you want examples? Here goes. The chaws, a reader is told at least eight time throughout the book the exact definition of a chaw, who is in what chaw, and what they did. Readers need only one reminding. I mean after all this is a 200 page book! \n Another example, the flecks and Soren's past. These are all constantly repeated to the point of boredom. \n Yes there needs to be a little trip down memory lane especially in children's books but if you start repeating information IN THE SAME BOOK you gotta stop and ask yourself if there's a problem. \n Besides this little end rant, I liked the book just found this little part annoying."}

In seventeen years, everything has been okay. She's a senior in school and hangs out with her friend Seth who she may or may not have a crush on. But things are about to change. For centuries, Keenan - the Summer Prince - has been looking for a special girl. One who would break the curse that his mother - Beira the Winter Queen - put on him when he was a baby. This curse makes it so unless he finds his true Queen, he will never have access to his complete powers and there will always be an eternal winter. \n *gnashes teeth* Okay, so I'm all one for faery tales, especially those that show the darker side of the fey like in Holly Black's fey books, but this one was just...A little bit too out there for me. I liked the premise of it. Human girl who can see the fey may just turn out to be the savior for the Summer King but wants nothing to do with that world.

{"text": "Fall picks up about a month after Fade ends, and Arionna is recovering in the hospital from Skroll and Hati's attack. Arionna is now plagued by nightmares of Fenrir and the twin demon wolves; she's also starting to understand the darker side of Dace's nature. Dace is willing to sacrifice anything and everyone to keep her from being attacked again, and Arionna fears this is going to turn him into a literal monster, so she leaves Bebee to go in search of answers to stop the apocalypse. \n The story starts out stronger than Fade does, and there's an urgency to Arionna's problems in this book that there wasn't in the first one. Her relationship to Dace is sorely tested, too, and there are good moments where Dace gives off the vibe that he could potentially become abusive. Arionna is smart enough to realize that, if she doesn't figure this thing out for herself, Dace's need to protect her is going to lead him to further manipulate her, controlling every aspect of her life. This is a challenge most heroines with alpha male boyfriends face, and Arionna is wise enough to know what the starter kit for an abusive relationship looks like; in a nice twist, she leaves Dace instead of him fleeing to protect her from himself. \n Rating: I can't state enough how I wanted to like this book more, but the ending killed it for me. Something else needed to happen; it was too much set-up and too little pay off. This isn't the first series I've read that's done this, and it ticks me off every time. Sequels are hard, I know, but book two is where the ugly, miserable parts of your characters and weird, complex world-building can really shine. I am going to finish this series, but 3 stars for dropping the ball on the climax. \n Read the rest of the review at Throw This Book at Me"}

She loves her stepsister Peony, but is constantly tormented by her stepmother Adri and her stepsister Pearl. She is constantly afraid that Adri is going to turn her as a test subject for the plague's cure team, but knows she can't since she's her family's only income. One day prince Kai appears at her tent and asks her to fix one of his droids. She hides the fact that she is a cyborg, and tries to get away for the prince, but they keep meeting. However, after the emperor dies from the plague, the Lunar queen and dictator Levana comes to earth to offer her condolences and to try to convince Kai to marry her, so she can conquer the Commonwealth. \n I would love to give this book 4 or 5 stars because I fell this saga deserves it. I loved the main characters, Cinder and Kai (even if he was a bit uni-dimensional and there was some insta love-ish) but I felt like they were funny and coherent. Their decisions made sense, most of the time, and Cinder has probed to be strong and smart. Of course, I hated Adri and Pearl, but I didn't care much for Peony or Iko. I loved the world, and I liked the way the book retells Cinderella's story. The thing is, NOTHING HAPPENS. The whole book is a big introduction and it just gets things in motion, but nothing actually really happens. Its mostly Cinder discovering who she is, dealing with her life and getting to know Kai. And while I liked the characters, it felt really slow paced. I wasn't expecting one of the big reveals, but the second one is kind of obvious once you know the first one Cinder being Lunar took me a bit by surprise. I knew there was something about her not having any family or memories, but I didn't connect the dots at first. However, after knowing that, it's easy to guess that she is princess Selene . I also enjoyed that Cinderella and Snowwhite are kind of the same story. I really dont get the whole cyborg hating thing. I would thing if there was the technology for it, it would eventually evolve into a Unwind kinda thing, where people use and abuse it. But here they hate it because there are wires in their head? Because they get another chance? Anyone that is cured of anything is having another chance at life, so I don't really get the hate to cyborgs, it confused me. It seems to me that society usually gets trapped in the technology craziness, not fear it. \n It took me a long time to finish this one because of how slow and predictable it was (I mean, there is a ball) but when I forced myself to finish it, I enjoyed it and wanted to read the next one right away."}
{"text": "L'amore che Adam prova per Juliette e inconsistente: un fuoco di paglia che e bruciato tanto velocemente cosi come si e dissolto. Adam e innamorato \"solo\" dell'idea di amarla, di proteggerla e averla per se. Ed e tanto ottuso da non vedere quello che sta nascendo sotto i suoi occhi: il sentimento puro, totale e unico che Aaron prova per Juliette, ed il fatto che lei stia imparando a scoprirlo ed amarlo. \n I pensieri di Adam sono focalizzati quasi interamente su James, il suo fratellino. Niente da ridire eh... Ma la cosa assurda e che Kenji deve ricordargli che la sua ragazza potrebbe essere in serio pericolo. Che potrebbero dividersi e fare entrambe le cose: salvare James e trovare Juliette.Logico no?! \n Naaaa per nulla, Adam il cavaliere dall'armatura scintillante, molla l'amata nelle grinfie del pazzo che odia (Warner) perche tanto lui non le farebbe mai del male!!!!! \n *facepalm* \n Sei un soldato pappamolla si?! \n Logica. Sangue freddo. Tattica.

E il massimo xd!!! \n (Adam penso solo che lei lo ha mollato...) \n Addie il tardone si riprende per dire: Juliette e una mia responsabilita ed e colpa mia see stata uccisa!!!!!! \n Applausi per Kent!!!!! \n MA VA A MORI AMMAZZATO VAIIIII Y=___Y= \n Mafi ti adoro perche, pur odiando Adam, hai reso piu chiaro il quadro generale. \n Kenji sei veramente un personaggio strepitoso. \n WARNER AMORE MIO SEI SEMPRE IL MIGLIORE!"}
{"text": "4 wolfy stars :) \n well, in spite the story has ended with some rush, I enjoyed it very much. \n not quite convinced how the things had been resolved (the fight between bad vamps and shifters), but it is a romance after all. \n the story has a good pace, fueled by some hot scenes ( when direwolf alfa gets his mate, the world tremble). \n for those who enjoy paranormal or fantasy with a little bit of erotic, this series is a good option."}

{"text": "The hype around this book was so large that by the time I picked it up there was no way it could have lived up to my hopes. It was well written and the twist at the end was clever and well done. I just felt immensely disappointed with a few things: \n 1. The female protagonist. I found her obsessive to the point that I wanted to throw the book across the room at times. Yes, I know that's typical for romance. But aside from her interest in this one boy, I couldn't figure out what other interests she had. There's one spot in the book where she talks about how smart she is, but I don't see an ounce of passion in her about anything except the boy she's attracted to. She doesn't paint, write, play an instrument, love to learn, or excel at anything at the school where she's been placed . . . oh, except stalking, she does pretty good at that. I almost found myself rooting for the female villian who tried to kill her because I agreed that this girl was just pitiful with her love sickness. \n 2. Unanswered question. By the end of the book there were still too many. It was as though the author gave us the answer to one big question, tied up one loose end, and then left about a dozen flowing free. I know it's a book in a series, so having it be a cliff hanger is inevitable. But there were simply too many questions unanswered for me. I felt massively jipped by the time I reached the last page. My exact words may even have been: \"Is that it?\" \n All that said, the story was engaging. The concept was creative and the male protagonist was interesting enough that it almost made up for the blandness of the girl whose point of view it was told from. More than anything, I'd hoped to see some growth in her character, but there just wasn't much if any. \n Lauren Kate does have a way with words, though. I read the whole thing in the course of two days. I'm sure, as a writer, I could learn a lot from her."}

{"text": "This book is the one that the HBO series \"True Blood\" is based on. SO, if you wouldn't watch the series on HBO, I would not suggest you read the book.

{"text": "Careful: there are spoilers form the previous book! \n After Enzo's death, Adelina travels with her sister Violeta to find other elites that can join her in her fight against Teren and the queen. \n Meanwhile, the daggers join Meave, the queen of another country and lover of Lucent, in a quest to resuscitate Enzo and defeat the queen with the rightful heir. \n I loved this book so much. And I know I'm on the minority here, but I sided with Adelina in the first book and I sided with here most of the second book also. \n I think the daggers are hypocrites. There, I said it. Yes, Adelina didn't fully trust them in the previous book, but they didn't either. They feared her, distrusted her, and also betrayed her. I really don't understand why they judge others when they do the exact same things. Why do lives don't count when they kill? \n Adelina says that Enzo is willing to forgive the Daggers so quickly, and she is right. Their plan was just as horrible as her was. They, Enzo included, were willing to do whatever it takes and use whoever it takes to get what they wanted. I understand that somewhere along the way Adelina lost herself and turned into a villain, but she has powers that make her mad. They say that the difference between a hero and a villain is that both look for their happy ending, but the villain is willing to do whatever it takes to get it. I think this book is full of villains then. \n I just loved Magiano. I hope we get to see him more in the next book, and his relationship with Adelina evolves. I also liked Sergio, and while Violeta exasperates me, I liked her in the final chapter. \n I still don't like Rafaelle. I still think he makes horrible choices, and I cant see him as a hero. He knows that all the things he did were wrong, and gets used by Meave the whole book even if he doesn't agree with what he is doing. \n Anyway, I always contemplated the Batman idea that the only difference between a her and a villain is a bad day. And sometimes it is, but something that's not enough. Some people can make the right choices even if they get betrayed and are abused. Others are not that strong. What I liked about this book is that it makes you revaluate what you think about good and bad. It makes you question yourself, and I think that in the end, I maybe a villain in disguise! \n I'm scared for Adelina in the next book. I think that she's going to eventually come back from the darkness and sacrifice herself, either for someone she loves or to send Enzo's darkness back to where he belongs. I would love to be wrong, because it would be a bit predictable. I'll have to wait and see!"}
{"text": "This review was written for Joyfully Jay Reviews and can be accessed here: http://joyfullyjay.com/2016/07/review... \n Aden is an emotionally-damaged, out gay man who goes to a concert and finds himself waiting for his final judgment. He has no idea how he died, but his angelic companion in line assures him that he's in the Hereafter. Aden expects to assigned to Hell. He's not a good guy, and yet, not all of that is his fault. \n When he arrives in front of Dante and Raphael, it's clear that they cannot decide where he belongs either, so they make him a bargain: thirty days on Earth and if he does right and learns about love, he can go to Heaven. Continue living as he had, selfish and narcissistic with no one to even mourn him? Hell for sure. \n Aden arrives in Caterham, a rural community south of London, with only the clothes on his back. He must find a way to survive without stealing or scamming if he wants to go to Heaven. He's also granted seven extra lives, in the event things don't go right. And, they don't. He meets the hood of Brody's car before he meets the driver. Yep, struck by a vehicle while walking down the unlit country lane. \n Brody is a veterinary surgeon with a bad past. He's back in Caterham living on his family's horse farm with his brother Des' family. Brody's hiding from his abusive ex, Matt--a man who really ought to be in prison. Brody hasn't gotten over Matt, but he's also tired of his abuse. I'm not going to explain their complicated history, but it's nasty and I was so glad Brody escaped. Still, Brody's whole life has been shaped by Matt's abuse, and it leads him to dark places, and more trouble. Hitting Aden wasn't part of the plan, but he's grateful when he and Des discover Aden hiding in Des' horse barn. At least he can try to help the man he thought he killed. \n Aden proves to be indispensible, saving Des' son from a bad fall, fixing farm equipment, and gentling Brody's own horse. All the while, the tension builds between Aden and Brody. Aden gains some insight into his final hours while he learns to be a good friend, and a good partner for Brody. He doesn't want Brody to fall for him, but he also doesn't want to abandon Brody when he learns about Matt and recognizes who he is: a dangerous, obsessed man who Aden fears will try to \"possess\" Brody in whatever way he can. \n This is a redemption tale, and it's well-told. Trigger warnings: I hadn't expected the level of abuse that was present for both Brody and Aden in their respective lives. That was startling, and sad. Expect a rape. Also, some recollections of vile child molestation. The circumstances of Aden's death were also shocking and poignant considering the recent spate of mass shootings in the world. While Aden struggles to do right, he's beset by Dante, who wants his soul in Hell, and aided by Raphael, who sees the innate goodness that a young, neglected and abused Aden learned to hide away. There's a lot of torment right here on Earth, and part of that is Aden finding love just when it's too late to grasp. \n Because there are spiritual elements present, readers should expect miracles to occur. And they are the best miracles, really. I had a bit of terror with some alternate endings that were rolling in my thoughts, which caused me to read all the faster. I knew that Matt was big trouble, and had been trouble for a very long time, so I feared he'd do serious harm. Spoiler alert: he does, just not in the heinous way I had been acutely fearing. I really felt a part of this story, and ached for Aden's soul to find peace, and Brody's life to be safe. The end is the best example of hopes realized that I've read in a while. It *might* seem a bit far-fetched, but this is a story about angels and demons and redeeming a lost soul; so, yeah. Miracles happen. Life goes on. Sexytimes for the right reasons. HEA on the horizon. If I didn't actually cry in reading this book, it was because I had no tears left."}

{"text": "The Just City is a brilliant book. College courses could and should be taught about it. The premise is a spectacular \"what if\". What if the Greek gods are real? What if one of those gods (Athene) wishes to create a Just City based on Plato's Republic? What if she decides to conduct her experiment in an isolated location (oh yes, it is Atlantis) where it cannot affect history? What if she is able to travel through time gathering up slave children ten years of age from different eras to become part of her experiment? What if she is only able to bring in Masters (guardians, instructors, chaperones) who have prayed directly to her requesting this life? What if her brother Apollo decides to be born as a mortal and live in this Just City as a human being in order to experience humanity? What if Athene decides to bring Socrates to the city five years into the experiment? The results are described by three different narrators: one from each of the three major groups. There is Simmea, a young Egyptian girl born sometime between 500 and 1000 A.D. who is kidnapped by slavers and sold to the masters. We also have Maia, a very educated Victorian lady who yearns for equality in a place that values learning above all else. And, Apollo is there to tell his story of a god trying to understand being human. Their stories intersect over about seven years of this experiment. It is a fascinating idea and not a book that I would normally gravitate to. I usually prefer lighter entertainment and Jo Walton really made me think. At times I was caught up in the story. Other times I got somewhat bogged down in the intellectual debates. I am glad that I persevered to the end but I doubt that I will read any sequels."}
{"text": "Feyre is at the Spring Court once again. But this time, she's not at home: she's a spy. Her mission is to break the Spring Court from inside and get all the information she can. The king of Hybern sends his niece and nephew to the court, and Freyre uses the opportunity to make her move. But when Iante attacks Lucien, Feyre has to change her plans. \n I love this book so much. I can't believe some think this book is not fast paced enough, or that it has too much sex, or is too long. I actually felt the ending a bit rushed and I wanted to read more, so much more. So many amazing characters, so many possibilities. \n I still love Feyre and Rhys. They are one of my favorite couples ever. They are so strong, smart, devoted and selfless, but at the same time protective of their loved ones. Freyre is not like most female characters, that get themselves in trouble by making stupid decisions all the time. Yes, sometimes she makes split of the moment decisions but they make sense. And the court of dreams... I can't even express how much I love them. Cassian and Azriel, Mor and Amren... they are so complex but great characters. I wish their stories were developed a bit more, but I guess we'll hear from then in the next books. \n I had a hard time liking Nesta. Eventually she starts behaving better and I was a bit more sympathetic to her, but still, I think she needs to grow up and stop being so selfish and self-centered. And I can't stand Elain. I want to like her, but the whole delicate flower thing was annoying most of the time. I feel like Feyre deserves an apology from both of them and that they start to take better care of Feyre. Most of the time its like they don't consider her family. \n I wasn't a fan about Mor being a lesbian. She may like man sexually, but she prefers women, at while it was explained and it kinda made sense, it was rushed and unnecessary. I get that the book was lacking some LGBT characters, but while I wasn't unbelievable and the explanation had some logic, I didn't buy it. \n I also loved Jurian. He was a great character and he surprised me when he revealed himself as an ally. He was kinda charming and I hope to read more of him \n And Tamlin... I don't hate him as I used to. At the end, he did the right thing and he let Feyre go. And the fact that he defended her at the camp... he's not a bad person, he's not a real villain either. He was just too consumed by love and hatred and desperation, and he has some serious anger issues to deal with, but in a way, he's still the man we fell in love with in the first book. \n I felt like Amren wasn't present enough. I get that she was key to the ending, but I wanted to see her in action, in battle. Most of the book she was reading and taking care of Elain, so she was basically missing. \n I also want to read more about Tarquin. He had such a great dynamic with Rhys and Freyre and I wanted to see them interact some more. \n There were so many deaths... the bone carver, the suriel, the weaver, feyre's father... there weren't many main characters deaths, but it was still bittersweet to see those characters sacrifice themselves. I did enjoy when Ianthe got what she deserved \n Overall the book was a journey, an amazing one. I laughed, I cried, I was surprised, nervous, heartbroken and couldn't stop reading. The war was brutal and I was shaking while reading (maybe because of the cold, but still) and I couldn't put the book down. \n Can't wait to read more books of these characters!!!"}

{"text": "This book brought me to tears. It wasn't all fun, some of it was bogged down in detail I thought, and there was one particular spot where I got irritated with Gemma for throwing so many fits and storming out of so many room. The preaching at the end was a bit much for me. It is all too easy to condemn past society for not seeing things as we do now, easy for us because we didn't live back then. A bit of a way out of examining ourselves and what needs to be changed about our present society, in my opinion. \n The story itself, though, is absolutely moving and captivating. It is a lovely story worth reading. I couldn't stop crying for quiet a while after reading this book for the beauty of the story. That alone is enough for me to give it five stars. \n Thank You Libba Bray!"}
{"text": "Deke is the youngest of the dragon-shifter Beteferoce family and isn't quite convinced his eldest brother, Jake, is telling the truth about finding his \"mate,\" Shae, but he's willing to check out this arrangement and see for himself. Plus, Deke noticed that Shae's neighbor and good friend, Bryan, is a fit specimen he'd like to get to know better. With Jake and Shae being obnoxiously in love, and thoroughly uncivilized in their sexy behavior, Deke is more-than-happy for Bryan's offer of a spare bedroom in his home. \n And let the sexytimes begin... \n Bryan doesn't usually fall into bed with a guy. He hasn't actually had a partner in years; not since he and Shae didn't work out. But, Deke is turning all his knobs in just the right way, much to Bryan's dismay. How can he be so consumed by a man so quickly? And, won't he be heart-broken when Deke returns to his Coast Guard duties hours away? \n During Deke's week-long visit he learns for certain that he and Bryan are true mates, just like Jake and Shae, but he's due to report for duty so he vows not to begin the bonding process until he can work out an extended leave. This, by the way, is triggered by fluid-exchange so Deke is careful to stay covered up. Well, except for, oh man! Deke!! \n Deke's so sure of his love, he tries to tell Bryan who he really is, and it all goes sideways. He had no idea how Bryan's previous history with the paranormal would skew this experience, but Deke holds faith that he'll be able to win Bryan's heart back, just as soon as he can get more time. The problem? The physical binding has already begun... \n Bryan can't understand what's happening to him once Deke leaves. He's lethargic and ill, and fevered, and unable to manage even the most basic tasks like doing the mechanic work he loves or feeding himself. Good thing Shae and Jake are looking in on him. While Deke manages his details for the Coast Guard, he craves Bryan, and fears what will happen if he shows up on Bryan's doorstep. And, it's even worse when he arrives. \n I liked this book better than the first, for a few reasons. There's a lot more tension, the sexytimes don't take over as much, and Bryan and Deke really have to build trust. I liked how Bryan was a man who'd had a dark past, and his growing love and trust for Bryan helped him to overcome old hurts. I think I was expecting to meet Bryan's long-lost brother at some point, and I will admit a touch of dismay when that didn't happen, but that's only because I'm a greedy reader--it had no impact on this story. For me, I'm hooked on the Beteferoce brothers finding eternal love, and I hope we get some insight on the Fae tattoo artist who seems to be linking them. I enjoyed a reveiw copy via NetGalley."}
{"text": "Let me begin by saying that my mouse hovered between the forth and fifth star for a good minute before I settled on four. In truth, it's more of a four and half. I loved this book, I really did, but it just wasn't quite up to par with the last book. It was by no means terrible, it was just lacking a little something. The first book was so rich in description and it seemed like more patience was taken with the plot. I wanted to read the book any moment I could because I just wanted to step into Elle's world, if just for fifteen minutes. This book felt a little more rushed and the characters started to feel a bit two dimensional. As new characters were introduced I began seeing them purely for their advancement of the plot. More than once I said to myself, \"Aha, I knew you would come in right here...\" Perhaps a few more pages might have helped weave them into the story better. \n That being said, I still enjoyed every moment of it. Elle is a strong (and stubborn) woman and I love reading about her. The ending caught me completely by surprise (which doesn't happen often) and I have to admit, I closed the book not too happy with the fact that I have to wait another year for the next book to come out. I would absolutely recommend this book, this book was a joy to read."}
{"text": "2.5 stars rounded up because of Weston. He gets all the stars he wants. \n This was, unfortunately, a case of a good idea poorly executed. \n Calamity is a simple farm girl who lives with her grandmother. She's never met her mother and has absolutely no idea who her father is. What she does know is that she is never ever allowed to take off her silver (I think that's what they are made of?) cuffs. One night, she awakens to a woman standing over her trying to steal said cuffs. She obviously freaks out and this awakens her grandmother as well. Turns out it's her mother trying to steal her cuffs, hoping to sell them. She manages to get one off, not realizing that they have a purpose. They provide protection from some nasty folks that would harm Calamity. But we don't know exactly why. Just a vague idea. Now that one has been taken off her wrist they can find her. She has to run. So she sets off, bound for somewhere far away, with instruction to find an escort to take her. She finds an escort, an assassin named Weston. He's not one for the warm fuzzies, but for his own reasons, he agrees to be her guide. The rest of the book is travel and chemistry between Cal and Weston. \n Right away, I could see the formula of the book. It's one I enjoy. Unsuspecting special girl meets the sexy anti-hero (in this case, assassin) that has his own agenda but eventually starts to find a soft spot for the special girl. Or hard spot. Mostly hard spot. \n Being the steamy romance loving woman with a pulse that I am, I loved Weston. Trained killer. Alpha. Sexy. Angry. Possessive. Brooding. Intense. He often toed the line of acceptable asshole behavior but I loved it. On top of all that was a little tiny bit of caring buried deep deep deep down. Sort of. Unfortunately, all of those yummy traits were completely wasted on Cal. Wasted, I tell you. She was the epitome of TSTL. I think she wanted to be murdered. Somewhere there was a pin board of her life goals and it was filled with all of the ways she was almost murdered in this book. And in true TSTL fashion, she never rescued herself. I think what I found most frustrating was that she never learned. Ever. It's one thing to get yourself into trouble and need to be rescued, but after the first dozen times, I blame her for it, not the multitude of people out to get her. She learned pretty early on that Weston could hear her thoughts. Yet over and over she would plan things and think to herself I hope Weston doesn't figure out what I'm about to do. I mean come on, Cal. Work with me here. She even acknowledged her own stupidity several times yet...did it anyway. And then wondered where it all went wrong. \n As for the writing? It was in need of good editing. The book was filled with oddly anachronistic words and idioms that just confused me. Considering Cal thought the fact that she disguised herself as a man was scandalous, would have used a horse for farming, and slept in an inn while drinking ale, it made zero sense when she thought to herself that something was a \"bummer\", referenced a rocket, or thought she was \"utterly screwed\". Granted the story takes place in a completely fictional world but it is reasonable to assume that this fantasy world is modeled after a time centuries before ours and so many of the phrases just didn't fit. There were also some grammatical issues and a few phrasings that didn't make sense as well (for example \"...think about with the ears in my head\", but that can all be fixed with a good editor. \n There are good things here though. I really enjoyed the actual plot. Put it this way, with all of those issues, I still enjoyed reading it. That's saying a lot. Usually, the above complaints would get an automatic DNF or one star from me. Yet I thought this book was interesting and fun enough to not only finish it but enjoy reading it. There is great potential here, it just wasn't reached. \n *Review copy kindly provided by author in exchange for a fair and honest review."}
{"text": "Percy Jackson, you have been warned. A new competitor has just entered the teen lit arena and he is sure to win over the hearts of teens and adults alike. Tut is sure to be a hit. \n Tut: The Story of My Immortal Life follows the journey of King Tut. Readers are first introduced to him in Ancient Egypt. Tut's life is in jeopardy. He is running from his uncle, who is responsible for the murder of Tut's family and is now out to get Tut. \n In his run in with his uncle, Tut is stabbed and about to die. In a last ditch attempt to live, he casts a spell that leads him to immortality. Unfortunately, it came with a price. Tut is doomed to spend the rest of his life as a 14 year old who must keep attending eighth grade over and over and over again. \n The novel continues with Tut in present-day Washington D.C. where Tut is attending eighth grade all over again and living with his brother-like guardian Gil and Horus. Tut discovers that his uncle may not be dead (as he has found immortality too) and he is ready to get his revenge. This sparks a search for a knife that will help Tut kill his uncle. \n Tut: The Story of My Immortal Life is everything that makes a great novel. It is fast paced, action packed, and is rather unique in its concept. Sure, Percy Jackson brought the well-known Gods to life, but this brings the often overlooked Egyptian gods to life. \n Hoover does an amazing job of not info dumping, but incorporating the god's backstory into the novel. It might not be the most in-depth look at the Egyptian gods, but it is enough to spark people's interest which I hope will encourage them to read on their own. \n One of the things I really liked was the way Hoover incorporated a parental figure into the story. When I read the blurb for this novel, I couldn't figure out how a 14 year old could just wander through life with no one questioning it. It appears it can be done when an older individual takes that 14 year old under their wing and acts like a parental figure. \n Gil, the parental/brother-like figure, in the story wasn't just placed there as a wall decoration. He was developed, had emotions, and really played a role in the novel. Many times YA/children's novels tend to have adult/parental figures take a back seat, but not in this one. \n Gil isn't the only character that is extremely developed. Hoover does an amazing job of quickly developing characters and making them relatable for the readers. The mortal characters were average, every day children that almost any reader could relate to instantly. Tut was likeable and funny. He was mature at times due to being alive so long, but there were times when he acted just like he was supposed to - a 14 year old boy. \n A favorite part of mine was the shabtis that follow Tut around. They were responsible for helping keep the house clean, but also helped Tut out a lot with homework and other day-to-day chores. I just loved the interactions Tut had with them. It added a nice, humorous touch to the story without ruining to the tone of the book. \n Overall, Hoover did an amazing job. Tut: The Story of My Immortal Life is an amazing start to a promising series. Hoover shows that it is possible to create a detailed, likeable story in approximately 300 pages. It will be interesting to see where this series is taken, what happens with the characters, and what is in store for Tut. I know I'll be waiting."}
{"text": "I nabbed HEART OF STONE off of NetGalley just so I could see if Christine Warren could write Urban Fantasy as hot as Karen Marie Moning. \n Mmm mmm mmm. Good stuff. \n About the Book: \n Ella Harrow is trying to carve out a normal life for herself. Well, as normal as an art geek with psychic abilities can hope for. As museum docent and gift-shop manager, Ella is able to keep her distance from people--and her powers in check--while surrounding herself with the artifacts she loves. But how on earth is she supposed to act normal when a thousand-year-old statue on the museum's terrace suddenly comes to life? \n Not your ordinary gargoyle, Kees has been asleep for eons, waiting for a portent of evil to wake him from his slumber. Kees isn't a vision; he's a bat-winged guardian created to protect the world from the seven demons of the Dark. Somehow, Ella triggered his reawakening. Maybe the demons have been unleashed? Maybe his heart is finally ready to be chiseled open? The fate of the world isn't carved in stone...yet. \n My Review: \n This was a super fun read. Ella is spunky. She's got a terrible amount of power that she strains to contain--particularly after the last time it escaped. Becoming an instant orphan will teach a gal control. One night she's attacked on the terrace of the art museums where she works and the statue beside her erupts into life. It's enough to make a gal swoon. She did. \n Kees isn't just a delicious art-come-to-life--he's a Guardian, and he knows the world is in big trouble when an untried, untamed magical girl can rouse him from his mystical slumber. Together they learn that the Keepers of Light are being systematically hunted down by the minions of Darkness. WIthout the Guardians Earth has no hope to prevent demonic subjugation. Kees fights against his emotional reactions--claiming to be nothing more than the stone he is--but Ella insists there's more to him than he will accept. \n Let's just say this: End of times doesn't normal equal romance, but the heat simmered from their first contact--long before they recognized the danger they were in. And, I am NOT a gal who's going to get miffed about some serious friction. Bam-chicka-bow-wow. \n Kees? D-Lish. Makes me want to hit the Art Institute just to see if I can find me some Guardian... \n In any case, Ella and Kees do get it right and track down the last Keeper they can find. Unfortunately he's torched soon thereafter by the Big Baddies. And they continue the hunt for both Keepers and Guardian statues--the remaining six which seem to be scattered to the four winds. All while dodging the Dark Ones. Ella's standoff in her childhood home leaves her with far better magical skills, and a few less enemies. \n It seems, instead of the usual rituals to awaken these magnificent defenders of humanity, a single woman of power can entreat the creature within to break his stony bonds--much like Ella did for Kees--if she is his true mate. And one of Ella's art friends may have found another Guardian. As this is the beginning of a new Gargoyles series, I expect there to be six similar books where a smart sassy gal brings her personal stony savior to life all to save the world. \n In total I liked the magical elements. I felt that Ella wasn't clueless, but needed training to use the powers she always knew she had. And Kees did train her. Hard. With his teaching, and some books gleaned from essential support characters, Ella built herself from a danger into a weapon for good--and in far less time than Mac Lane. Also, did I mention the sex? Kinda like voting in Chicago it happens early and often... Nice. \n Interested? You can find HEART OF STONE at your local bookstore, Goodreads, Amazon, Barnes & Noble and iBooks. \n If you pick this one up, make sure to come back and tell me your thoughts. \n In the meantime, keep reading my friends! :)"}
{"text": "It's like the Nightside books, except that nearly half of the weird stuff presented actually had a purpose! So, despite the fact that the protagonist spent more time congratulating himself for being clever and bad-ass than he did actually being clever or, y'know, halfway competent, I'll be looking for the sequel. Perhaps in that one the protagonist won't be so ridiculously overpowered that the text of every fight scene could be replaced by \"OMG WE'RE GOING TO DIE -- but wait, I had this handy-dandy Save-The-Day-Device in my back pocket all along, so I never really had any reason to be panicked or even mildly alarmed.\" I know I sound disparaging, but it was so nice to be able to enjoy the plot of a Simon R.

{"text": "5 stars \n Wow. \n I don't even know where to start with this one. There was so much going on which is part of the mainstay of this series... the intertwined multi-subplots. \n I love Rehv and Ehlena. Another couple that were perfectly matched. I enjoyed seeing their relationship build slowly... or as slowly as compared to previous couples. \n There are two sides to Rehv. The symphath and the vampire, both of which he must control and balance at all times. On the exterior, Rehv is seen as a mogul, a hard businessman not to be messed with. Underneath it all though is a heart of gold only reserved for the privileged few in his life. Rehv has a huge protective nature which is one of the reasons to love him. He protected his mother and sister, Bella. And for years now, he has sacrificed himself to protect Xhex and his true nature from being exposed. \n As a civilian vampire, Ehlena is working hard to support herself and her mentally incapacitated father. And as a nurse, one must have beneficence: to do good for others. So when Rehv came into Havers's clinic, she felt the need to do good by him even though he made her nervous. She also has an unbreakable backbone to stand up for the truth and fight for what she believes in. Rehv finds himself drawn to Ehlena, knowing that she would never accept him if she ever find out his true colors. \n As the heat build between Rehv and Ehlena, things also heat up between John and Xhex, although their HEA is far from attainable. It broke my heart by what happened between them. John Matthew is on a downward spiral. I understand the change in him but I hate to see the soft side of him dissolve. \n The lessers continued to be lead by Lash as they build their capital to gain more power to destroy the Brotherhood. The Brothers will definitely have a fight on their hands that's for sure. \n I love seeing more of Wrath and Beth and the difficulty that they have to face not only as a couple but for Wrath himself as king. We get to see Tohr come back little by little too. The humorous interactions between Lassiter and the other Brothers lighten the tension in parts of the book. I'm curious what role he has to play as we the series progress. \n Vishous glanced at the king. \"You told me I could beat him. You promised.\" \n \"As soon as you come home,\" Wrath said as he got to his feet, \"we'll hang him up by his armpits in the gym and you can use him as a punching bag.\" \n \"Thank you, baby Jesus.\" \n Blond-and-Black shook his head. \"I swear, one of these days I'm just going to leave.\" \n As one, the Brothers all pointed at the open door and let silence speak for itself. \n \"You guys suck.\" \n The ending is somewhat cliffhanger-ish. I'm glad I don't have to wait to start into the next book. I have a huge attachment to John and Xhex so I can't wait to see how their story unfold."}

{"text": "I really like Meg Cabot. Her princess diaries books are so fun. And I actually really liked this book (I got the book on tape). But there are two things that I didn't like. \n One, the language. Like I said, I was listening to it on my tape while I'd clean and things, so the first time I heard a swear word I thought I'd misheard it. But I didn't. The swearing is just sporadic (thanks, Clueless) enough that you think it's the last time they'd swear. I counted only four or five times the characters used a vulgar word. But it was a word that really gets under my skin. The Savior's name in vain. So that knocked it down a few stars. \n Two, I didn't love the ending. The story was so good and such a fun idea that I thought it would have a bigger ending than it did. It was kinda a boring ending. \n But it was really the swearing that did it for me. If it hadn't been for the cuss words I would have given it four stars. \n But overall, it really was a fun idea for a book."}

Teresa's writing is such that you feel like you are in the room with all of them - from the homecoming to the ooh la la lovemaking to the fights. Teresa has definitely outdone herself. I love all the books in this series but I have to say that Duncan is by far my favorite. \n Would I recommend this book to everyone? You bet I would. It is definitely a must read.

{"text": "The Perfectly Proper Paranormal Museum by Kirsten Weiss is a fun possibly paranormal cozy mystery, and the first installment in a series under the same name. \n The novel opens with Maddie Kosloski and her friend Adele, who owns the Paranormal Museum and the second half of a building, which the latter is remodeling into a tea shop. The two women are confronted with the dead body of a not-so-likable acquaintance, Christy, in chapter one. \n Christy, it seems, had a knack for making enemies. While reading, you can't feel sympathy for the dead woman. It also appears as though everyone had a motive to kill her. \n \"Mother always told me to stay positive. But I can't help feeling like another show is about to drop.\" \n Maddie has significant faith that the police will handle the case with care and find the killer. However, she soon discovers that the school bully, Laurel Hammer, is one of the detectives in charge of the investigation, and it seems she has a grudge against Maddie. \n The first introduction we get of Laurel, apart from reminder of Maddie's friend Harper, is this: \n \"Laurel Hammer banged open the door to the interview room. \"So which one of you two idiots killer her?\" \n Maddie constantly tries to get people to tell the police what they know, and tries to do the same herself, but the police look at her as a likely suspect, especially when a second body appears; another fairly dislikable acquaintance. Even after they arrest her friend Adele, Maddie tries to be the good citizen and help the detectives. \n The Perfectly Proper Paranormal Museum is narrated from the first person perspective of Maddie, who gets many funny and entertaining thoughts. She is also down to earth and realistic, so it is easy to imagine her and imagine being in her place. Also, we go deeper into her character as she hesitates about managing the Paranormal Museum, while job hunting after being fired from her previous job. \n \"Dion Fortune's scrying mirror.\" [said Herb]... \"Of course, I'm asking ten thousand.\" \n I coughed. \"Dollars?\" \n \"But for you, five.\" \n \"Thousand?\" I wouldn't pay five thousand for Ali Baba's mirror. There was no way anything in the museum cost that much. \n The overall pace is fairly quick. There is constant moving and events, but in terms of solving Christy's murder, things are a bit slow. There was also the GD cat, a recurring theme in paranormal novels, although I couldn't understand that cat or its intentions. \n The Perfectly Proper Paranormal Museum is home to second mystery, one which Maddie stumbles upon, immerses herself in and takes it upon herself to solve. The mystery revolves around the picture of a woman named Cora, who is accused of murdering her husband. \n I truly enjoyed the mystery within a mystery, and how Maddie goes about in order to search for two killers, one dead and one alive. \n Another thing I enjoyed is how Weiss constantly made the reader think and doubt if the Paranormal Museum can live up to its name by being haunted - or not. Up until the end of the novel, the reader has doubts. \n \"The atmosphere thickened, choking. The quiet stretched, the only sound my own harsh breath, breath I could see in the air. It was a nails on a chalkboard silence, a deep silence that tightened my throat, made me tremble.\" \n I particularly liked the development in Maddie's character, a trait not often seen in mystery novels. When we first see Maddie, she has low self-esteem, and who can blame her after nine months of job hunting with no development in getting a job. But as the novel ends, we see a significant change in her character, both in her attempt to catch the killer and in her negotiation skills. \n The Perfectly Proper Paranormal Museum is a quick, well-written and light read, with a mystery within a mystery and possible ghost. \n Note: I received a free copy via Lori Great Escapes Virtual Book Tours in exchange for an honest review as part of a blog tour for the book."}

{"text": "I received a copy of The Wrong Girl as an arc through Netgalley. \n To start with, I have to say this book has one of my new favorite opening lines. \n To say I'd been kept prisoner my entire life in an attic wasn't quite true. It was only fifteen years out of eighteen, and I was allowed to walk in the gardens for a half-hour some days. \n Hannah's story picks up quite quickly--as soon as we have a taste of what her normal life is, and calling it normal is quite a stretch and she's immediately painted as a sympathetic character--she's yanked away. Literally. \n Although she's been kidnapped, her circumstances have actually improved and that creates a lot of tension between who she wants to be loyal to, and what resolution she wants. Someone, and quite possibly a lot of people, are being less than honest with her and the majority of the book is centered around her finding out the truth about who she is, and why her circumstances are what they are, all while trying to keep her very big secret. \n The more I read the more curious I became and I found myself flying through pages, searching for answers. A few times I found myself accidentally skimming not because it was boring, but because I just had to know what was going on. \n The twists were surprising and well-crafted. I didn't see several of them coming. \n Hannah is a very likeable heroine. She's sassy, smart, determined and loyal. There is a light undercurrent of potential romance that I expect might get picked up in other books, but there isn't much of one in this one. \n If you like paranormal, historical and suspenseful reads, you'll probably like this one."}

I liked the concept of chosen family as well as the connections back to Percy's world through Annabeth. I like the idea of changing fate and how life is in the moments and details. It kept Riordan's nerdy and board-line lame humor that you still manage to laugh out loud to. It follows Riordan's formula to a tee, for better and for worse. I also enjoyed the teaser in the epilogue, as well as the possibility of a Percy/Magnus cross over.

After having a small pity party for herself, though, she comes back stronger than ever and determined to only be friends with Ren since that was how they started the last time. He agrees to her plan and things become easier between them as they, Mr. Kadam and Kishan go on the lookout for the third sacrifice to Durga. \n But this one is different than the others.

Along the way, wills will be tested, love will flourish and hearts will break (multiple times), and their lives will be put on the line. \n There's good news and there is bad news with this book.

{"text": "This review was originally written for Joyfully Jay Reviews and can be accessed here: http://joyfullyjay.com/2016/01/review... \n 4.75 stars! \n Okay. Wow. So, I KNOW I'm a total sap, but this book exploited my weepy sentimentality more than once. This was a Christmas read that was almost as overlooked as poor Willie's meager present on Scrudge's desk, and I'm so thankful that the author allowed me to get my romance-loving hands all over this modern M/M \"Christmas Carol.\" \n E.B. Scrudge is a mean one. He's the CEO of Scrudge and Barley, the heartless insurance company he inherited from his lover, Cornelius Barley. Ol' Corny was a heck of a miser, and delighted in laying off employees on Christmas Eve. E.B., or Ebbie to his intimates, continued this barbarism. He also has indulged in his personal assistant in the same manner as Corny did. \n See, Ebbie was Corny's assistant before he seduced Corny and became his stalwart companion and business partner fourteen years ago. With Corny in his grave, Ebbie's got the reins, and he's topping his dead partner in callousness. Willie, Ebbie's devoted assistant, is blindly in love with the boss. He's eager and anxious to take any of the affectionate scraps that Ebbie is willing to toss his way. Expect some seriously sexy not-at-all-HR-approved shenanigans. Whoo! \n Thing is, Ebbie has had it pretty rough, too, as we observe in his travels with the Ghosts of Christmas: Past, Present and Future on Christmas Eve. Ebbie's tortured beyond all bearing. I'm not going to belabor the plot as it follows the general scheme of the Dickens' classic with a wholly modern and sexy view. Expect homophobia, shunning, and heartbreak. \n In truth, I was expecting a bit of a cartoon. The ghosts are lampoons of some of the seediest gay tropes, from a bull dyke to a jaded drag queen, with a beefcake bottom pig in the middle. That said, they are rendered carefully, and with such attention that they are not just caricatures, and they expose Ebbie horrifically. Even Bill--short for Belinda--looks into Ebbie's life and shares his sorrow over his tumultuous and tragic childhood. \n Because Carol is a redemption tale, expect Ebbie to see the light and make amends in grand style. There were three points in the story that quite honestly brought tears to my eyes--and they were not all at the end. I was fully sucked into this story, and though Ebbie is hateful, hurtful and worthy of scorn, knowing that he's going to get his and make everything right went a long way to keep me reading. He's just that vile. Ebbie is the written epitome of the opportunistic 80s \"greed is good\" mantra; I had a strong reaction to him. And while the prose is whimsical in its construction--with numerous humorous asides to the audience and turns of phrase that harken to Dickens--it is not whimsical in message. This retelling never loses sight of the original: this is a life or death tale for Ebbie's soul, and his heart. \n The stakes are high for Ebbie, and also for his assistant Willie, whose continually spurned love for Ebbie is pure. Goodness knows why. As that's one of the tenets of the opening, I can't fault Willie's judgment. He's endured years of Ebbie's abuse and heartbreak, and still goes back for more. Part of that is surely due to Willie's lack of family connections, and it's really tough to witness. Well, it was for me. The end was less trite than I expected, the joy and ebullience of Ebbie's redemption being rather spectacular. I really--REALLY--loved how Ebbie fixed his relationship with Willie, corrected his most recent dastardly deeds, and reached out to those he had never wronged to make their lives easier. This is, without question, a romance and an HEA. \n If you like Christmas reads, and you dig retellings of Dickens' A Christmas Carol, this book should be in your hands. As I can quote SCROOGED, and make a habit of reading A Christmas Carol to my kids every few years at Christmastime, it was a knockout read for me."}
{"text": "Before reading this, I'd only read on book by Butler (Kindred, in high school), and this one sounded so interesting; I was especially intrigued when I learned that this was the last book she wrote before she passed away. But I was disappointed and, overall, pretty creeped out. Actually, not \"pretty\" creeped out. Really. Really creeped out. \n And here's why: \n The main character, Shori (called Rene at the start of the book before she learns who she is) is a fifty-something year old vampire creature who *looks* like an eleven year old girl. And the first character she gets involved with is a hairy twenty-three year old guy. And they get involved. It's beyond uncomfortable. I paused the audiobook after the first hour and realized that I'd been grimacing for twenty miles of my commute. My face hurt. \n Now, Butler explains this relationship and others through an original twist on the vampire myth, the effects of vampire venom, and unconventional physical aging, but the fact is that this character looks like a child and throughout the book she's having sex with human adult characters in addition to feeding off of them in a highly sexualized way. \n After I got over that (but let me be frank: I never got over it; in fact, I'm grimacing right now just thinking about it) I tried to get into the actual story. Butler brings up important and interesting themes of race, fear of the \"other,\" family, community, and mortality. Interesting themes yes, but the story itself couldn't keep my attention. The plot was slow, there were about two dozen more characters than were necessary (and none of them were well developed, just described in detail by Butler), and the courtroom drama aspect during the last portion of the book was dull as dishwater. And it wasn't supposed to be. \n Nothing in this story felt immediate or relevant. Maybe it was the style, the fact that the characters and the communities they lived in were so removed from \"normal\" human society, or the narrator (Tracey Leigh) who had to read about fifty character voices, some of them with accents, and forty-eight of them awkward. And I'm sure a lot of people really liked this book. I just wasn't one of them."}

Nor was she expecting being told that she had to deliver a girl child in three months, or else things would end badly for her. She also wasn't expecting to be towed around on a leash like she was a common animal. But the last thing she was expecting was to fall in love with a companion, a traitorous crime that is punishable by death. \n Compared to the last book I read, The Jewel was a breath of fresh air. The characters jumped off the page. The world was an intriguing one to read about. It sort of reminded me of The Handmaid's Tale only with a little bit more regency intrigue."}
{"text": "I purchased a copy of House of shadows as part of a group read through Goodreads and I'm glad I did. \n Being a vampire fan, I was happy to read a new and believable take on the species. In this story his vampires are called the Breed, and they make it quite clear that they don't even consider themselves in the same league as traditional vampires. There are some similarities, but I think Walter was successful in trying something new. \n The main plot follows the story of a young man named Eugene who is saved from his destitute life by a beautiful woman. However unknowingly he becomes an intricate part in her plan to become not only a member of the Breed but to also save her household. All goes according to her plan, until Eugene awakens as a member of the breed, only to discover that the woman who turned him has disappeared and he has been left alone. Eugene must discover how to cope with his new life and discover what has happened to his sire, but being a newly born vampire has enough problems on its own. He is attacked on all fronts, not only from members of his own kind, but also from the predator that now lives inside him. \n House of shadows is a fast paced well written adventure, which kept me turning pages. It is a wonderful addition to the vampire genre and its hidden mystery left me wanting more. My only regret was that it was short. I wish I could have learned more about what Eugene would have to face in the future but I guess I will have to wait for the next one. I recommend this to anyone who loves vampires and a good supernatural mystery."}
{"text": "Nie ukrywam, po ksiazke siegnelam glownie dlatego, ze zachwycila mnie okladka (na obrazku nie prezentuje sie w polowie tak dobrze jak na zywo). Na dodatek szata graficzna przypomniala mi ukochana serie Study (ktora doceniam coraz bardziej im wiecej ksiazek czytam). Kiedy szukajac kolejnej lektury w walizce brata zobaczylam czerwonowlosa dziewczyne w czerwonej dlugiej sukni z lukiem, na zielonym tle moja dusza krzyknela wielkim glosem ,,bierz to kobieto!\". Jestem wrazliwa na pewne doznania estetyczne ale pierwszy raz pokusilam sie o siegniecie po ksiazke przez okladke. Podchodze podejrzliwie do zbyt pieknych okladek, uznaje bowiem, ze jesli ksiazka jest naprawde dobra, ascetyczna okladka w zupelnosci wystarczy. Nie lubie tez jak ktos mi sie z okladka wtrynia w moje wyobrazenia o postaciach albo w to jak powinnam widziec jdany swiat. Czesto widze go ,,zle\", a czesto po prostu inaczej niz autor zapewne by sobie zyczyl, ale dobrze mi z tym. Nie ukrywam, ze bardziej od szczegolow danego swiata interesuja mnie postaci i ich relacje, a jesli o to chodzi dosc rzadko cos sobie ,,zle\" wyobrazam. Chyba, ze ewidentnie moja logika protestuje jak widzi co czyta. Ale wtedy po lekturze wspominam o tym co mi sie nie podobalo. Shed happens. \n Wracajac do Fire. Dobrze, ze nie czytalam zbyt dokladnie tego co bylo napisane na okladce. Niedawno przeczytany Clockwork Angel mial rekomendacje pani Meyer i dosc nieufnie podeszlam do tego tytulu, by zobaczyc ze poziomem dorownuje niemal Darke Academy (przez jakis czas przypominalo mi to serie o Straznikach Czasu ale nie oszukujmy sie, tam swiat przynajmniej probowal miec jakis sens; w Clockwork byla tragedia i masakra i powinnam byla to opisac ale czekam na Clockwork Princess zeby miec obraz calosci; po Clockwork Prince sie powaznie zastanawiam czy na pewno chce; raczej nie ale coraz wieksza ochote mam poznecac sie nad seria Clockwork). Alez mnie dzisiaj dygresje atakuja z kazdej strony, od razu widac, ze dawno nic nie pisalam. Na samej gorze okladki Fire znajdowalo sie porownanie do Twilight'a i dobrze, ze nie widzialam bo ucieklabym z krzykiem. Potem byloby mi przykro bo ksiazka nie byla najgorsza. \n . \n Ksiazka zaczyna sie dziwnie, od przedstawienia jednej z postaci i do teraz nie rozumiem czemu mial sluzyc ten zabieg. Nie widzialam najmniejszego sensu w zastosowaniu go w takim miejscu. Przedstawienie jakie dziecinstwo mial chlopiec posiadajacy Grace, czyli tzw Graceling mialo szanse byc ciekawe gdyby to on byl glownym bohaterem. Juz w dziecinstwie byl specyficzny i jak sie okazalo manipulowal od niemowlectwa ludzmi dookola wydajac im polecenia za pomoca glosu. Jego watek zostaje urwany w momencie jak dociera on do kraju w ktorym zyje glowna bohaterka. Dostajemy tylko krotka informacje, ze chlopiec zaczyna tam swoje nowe zycie jako Lack. Bedzie wtret dla znajacych fabule. Zrozumialabym przedstawienie krotkiej historii z zycia Cansrela i potem ewentualne wzmianki na ten temat zamiast przydlugich wspomnien Fire. Ze Immiker byl szuja wiedzielismy w zasadzie od razu, nie potrzebowalam opisu jego dziecinstwa zeby to zauwazyc. Wstep wydal mi sie zbedny. Kiedy autorka przeszla do wlasciwiej historii zobaczylam, ze jednak ksiazka cos w sobie ma i bede ja czytac do konca. Glowna bohaterka mnie zaintrygowala. Od razu bylo widac, ze dzieje sie tam cos dziwnego i relacje poszczegolnych bohaterow sa specyficzne. Dosc szybko dostajemy informacje takie jak pochodzenie Fire i to czym jest. Fire byla ostatnia z tzw human monsters. Dells - kraj w ktorym mieszka jest pelny przeroznych dziwnych stworzen ale human monster to prawdziwy rarytas. Zwykle potwory sa piekne, w teczowych barwach. Ich styl polowania byl dosc wyrafinowany i malo przyjemny dla ofiar, ktore byly oczarowywane pieknem, a potem konsumowane nie majac nawet pojecia co sie dzieje. Motyw z ludzkim potworem byl wiec dosc ciekawy. Przekleta pieknosc etc. To co mi mocno zgrzytalo to raczej wybiorcze prezentowanie rekacji na nia i dopasowane do aktualnej potrzeby zmiany zachowania ludzi. W jednej chwili wszyscy padali jej do stop, w innej chcieli ja zabic, a w innej w zasadzie mieli ja gdzies. Co sie troche nie trzymalo kupy. Generalnie Fire unikala spotkan z innymi luidzmi bo jako samica odczuwala zdecydowana awersje do wiekszosci swoich wielbicieli. Byla samotna co jeszcze bardziej komplikowalo sytuacje. Miala ojca, ktory zginal kiedy miala 15 lat i od tego momentu zyla sama w domu niedaleko swojego drugiego, przybranego ojca Brockera i jego syna Archera. Jako childhood friend Archer byl w niej zakochany i nieziemsko o nia zazdrosny. Nasza bohaterka jednak, generalnie nieszczegolnie zadowolona z zycia, zmuszona do ciaglego ukrywania sie przed innymi potworami i przed ludzmi bardzo zdecydowanie nie zyczyla sobie relacji romansowej z Archerem. Byl jej przyjacielem, z ktorym od czasu do czasu szla sobie do lozka. Chyba glownie na zasadzie ,,a czemu nie?\". Tlumaczyla to jako potrzebe przebywania kolo kogos zywego, kto napelnilby ja energia. W skrocie, uzywala sobie Archera i jego sil zyciowych jako mentalnego paliwa, ktore trzymalo ja przy zyciu. Miala przy tym szalenie irytujacy zwyczaj. Zwyczaj, ktorego nadal nie rozumiem, chociaz zalozenia do mnie trafiaja. Otoz nie mogla sypiac, miala koszmary i kiedy nadchodzila noc wybierala sie na dlugie spacery po lesie. Sama. W nocy. Nawet jak miala przestrzelona przez strzale reke. Pogratulowac. Cos dziwnego pchalo ja do wylazenia w nocy i patrzenia w gwiazdy co samo w sobie nie byloby takie glupie gdyby nie to, ze przy okazji ryzykowala swoje zycie. Potwory bowiem nie byly niewinne jak nasze dziki czy zubry. Ale to chyba jedyna rzecz, ktora mnie draznila w ksiazce. Przy okazji powyzsze zachowanie bylo paliwem dla klotni Fire z Archerem. Te z kolei mnie zwyczajnie meczyly, mialy szanse wystepowac w naturze, poza lazeniem nocnym nie mialam wrazenia, ze postaci byly kukielkami ktorym sie cos wciskalo na sile bez sensu (yeah, oczko w strone Clockwork, Darke i Straznikow). Jednak klotnie byly po prostu meczace. \n . \n Nie zdziwie nikogo mowiac, ze zawiazek watku romantycznego wydal mi sie bardzo uroczy. Nic specjalnie oryginalnego i od samego poczatku widac co sie swieci. I enjoyed it anyway. Co prawda do teraz nie moge zdecydowac czy ilosc przypadku byla odpowiednia czy jednak zbyt duza co sugerowaloby, ze chyba byla odpowiednia, jednakze dalam rade opanowac moje rozbuchane oczekiwania. Powiedzialabym, ze kilka scen bylo o klase-dwie nizej niz Study ale trzymaly wysoki poziom tak czy inaczej. Ciekawe czy za kilka lat tez bede z takim rozczuleniem czytac te komentarze kiedy porownywalam do siebie kilka ledwo co przeczytanych ksiazek. It's fun either way. Niesamowicie przypadly mi do gustu spacerki i krotkie rozmowy Bregana i Fire. Oboje mieli powody zeby nie moc spac i oboje mieli traumatyczne dziecinstwo i zycie ogolnie. Nie jestem zwolenniczka zbyt wielkiej ilosci dramy w ksiazkach ale tutaj nie razilo mnie to az tak bardzo. Chociaz dziabalo mnie co jakis czas, ze Fire sie troche nie zachowuje jak 17-letnia dziewczyna. No dobrze, zycia latwego nie miala niemniej... Jestem czysta i niewinna i moj swiatopoglad nieco protestuje. Przy czym co ja, wychowana w dobrobycie i rozpuszczona jak dziadowski bicz moge wiedziec o zyciu? Relacje miedzy postaciami generalnie nie zachwycily mnie jakos szczegolnie. Archer, Nash... Nie bylam fanka jakichkolwiek innych relacji niz Fire-Bregan. Ilosc tajemnic i dziwnych zbiegow okolicznosci na metr szescienny powietrza moze pomine. Jednym to moze pasowac, innym nie. Plot twist dotyczacy Brockera i Archera byl dla mnie nieco zbyt naciagniety. Intrygi palacowe to norma i zbiegi okolicznosci moga wyskakiwac z lodowki niemniej co za duzo to niezdrowo. Mam zamiar przeczytac poprzedniczke i kolejna ksiazke z serii i mam nadzieje, ze sie nie zawiode."}
{"text": "It was amazing!!! I'll post my review soon! :D"}
{"text": "I liked this book, but I really would have liked it with more \"vampyre\" in it. It was more of a travel log with some adventure thrown in for good measure. There were so many opportunities for it to be amazing but it seemed to fall short each time. \n With that being said, I wish 3.5 stars was an option. I did really like it. I enjoy her writing style."}
{"text": "So much good here! Whereas Alloy of Law could be read as a stand-alone, this sequel digs back into so much original Mistborn trilogy references while also looking forward that it really can best be enjoyed knowing the entirety of the series. Regardless, the character developments of Wax, Wayne, and Marasi are so good I squealed frequently in delight or anguish. Oh, and if Hoid-spotting were a drinking game, I'd totally play it with Wayne."}
{"text": "Perhaps among the imaginary giant characters I am more familiar with, King Kong stands out among them. I can see his replicas in toy stores (And for sure you can even come across him in Universal Studios). I can play him on video games. I can read him in comics. I can see him making fun of children as a mascot at birthday parties. He could scare the living day lights out of me in a haunted house at an amusement park or even on Halloween day. Above all, he could make an antagonistic cameo appearance in fantasy dramas or movies. He can be famous in any situations. Thanks to its movie adaptation, he is now immortal. For sure, he will be borne upon in the mind of the next generation since it is said to have another movie remake. \n I have seen its 2005 movie remake and I enjoyed it a bunch. Comparatively, having watched its movie adaptation gave me the ideas of the plots and settings. However, nothing beats the book. It gave me more clear description and narration. Imagining King Kong gave me the creeps. Also, I could feel the atmosphere of the unchartered, far-flung Kong Island. I could feel the breath-taking hue and cry among the characters. \n Although I am now a young adult and I no longer believe in fantasy, I still find it fascinating. King Kong is a downright strange, far-fetched creature. Something or someone unusual can get my attention. Besides, the theory of poor old Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution is instilled in me. So a confluence of questions popped into my head. Pop! How if there were such a gigantic monkey? Gee whiz! \n Granted that it is a fantasy, Cooper seems to have made a botch of , or to put it bluntly, to have monkeyed around with some settings. He must have intended to leave us readers hanging, turning over the questions such as: How long does it take the main characters to get to Kong Island? How do they manage to load King Kong onto a ship back to New York? Hehehe Even a genius kindergarten could call it into a question. \n In the end, it just occurred to me that we, the said highest mammal on this planet, would be defensive against another species superior to us. It would be a big, big threat. Figuratively speaking, King Kong resembles some hot issues today such as the advanced robotics, nations with big economy, nuclear deterrent, etc. \n Admittedly, I am still completely flummoxed by some latent meanings of this book. Obviously, the themes have something to do with survival, lost civilization, dominance of human to animals....But the book gives emphasis on the Beauty and the Beast. King Kong represents The Beast who will fall for Anne Darrow as the Beauty. At the end of the story, Danhem bragged before the news reporters that, \"It's the Beauty killed the Beast...\" What do you think Danhem means? \n I worried that I would not enjoy it since I have seen its movie; it could be kitsch; it could have been just a product of a child's imagination. Also, the passages must be awash with low standards of languages. Not bad. It is still a classic everyone should not underestimate. Merian Cooper had somehow what it took to be a fantasy-adventure writer. \n I'm looking forward to its most-awaiting movie remake since we have now ultramodern media production ^^"}

{"text": "See full review for The Iron Trial at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n On top of the whole magic thing, Call is different in one other way. His left leg has been through hell and back and still doesn't work the way it's supposed to. All his life that has been another factor to Call being weird. And even though he doesn't fail like he's supposed to at The Iron Trial, he still feels like the odd person out because of how spectacularly he did fail. \n Eventually though that's all put to rest. His fellow classmates become his friends, but he still wants to know one thing. If the Magisterium was a place for Call to belong, then why was his father so against him joining the magical school? He may not like the answer he receives."}

{"text": "I honestly don't know what to say about this. Given everything I've heard about these books I thought that they would be right up my street. Maybe because I read it during my commute in the morning whilst trying not to fall asleep didn't do it justice. \n There were clearly bits that were ironic and mildly amusing, even though they didn't really bring a grin to myself. In some places it seemed too clever. Maybe there have been authors that have taken on this style and developed it, which is maybe why I found it so.... odd. \n And I've got to admit, I just didn't understand it. Was there a storyline? Was it just a series of events? Is this what it was supposed to be? If it was, fair enough, but I still found it very hard to follow. \n I will probably read a couple more in the series to qualify my view, but perhaps it just isn't my cup of tea, which would be a shame!"}
{"text": "Ahhhh, finally a sequel that is just as good as it's predecessor. I definitely love the fact that there's more Wesley in this book. Squeeee >.< I know it says I took a week but honestly it's just because I've been busy. I literally read like half of this book just yesterday before finally finishing it up today. I love Mac's character because she is just so real to me. She's also smart and flawed and clever and doubtful and kick-ass and is just an awesome protagonist to follow. I reaaaaaally really hope there's a third book or this is turned into a series because I really just want to see more of this world and these amazing characters. Hey, maybe it could be turned into a mystery type series, haha. But either way, I loved this book and the writing was just as impeccable as expected. I would highly recommend."}
{"text": "The second book in this wonderful trilogy was just as exhilarating as the first! The comedy was on point and I'll tell you why: Xemerius. I LOVE HIM..IT? LOL. Who knew Gier could make a gargoyle funny and have it actually work with the story. I also love James, I mean how fun and great was it to actually meet him when he was alive and kicking! We left the first book with Gwen and Gideon kissing and we open the book right in that same scene. Having read all the books a couple times, I can still say that the romance was the only problem I had with this series. I honestly couldn't stand Gideon or his romantic notions and crap with Gwen. Don't get me wrong, I love Gwen, she's a great, funny and so very realistic protagonist but god was the romance such a disappointment. I just didn't like their relationship and whole 'connection' between them, oh well. Still, it didn't deteriorate my opinion on the books as a whole. \n We were introduced to Raphael, Gideon's little brother who takes an interest in Lesly. Nothing special there really, again, don't get wrong I love Lesly as well but they don't really contribute to the storyline much except for a certain part, but thats really it. Can I just say how entertaining and cool it is to hear and read through Paul and Lucy's P.O.V. in the epilogues? \n Not much to say for this book, except that the final last book is way better and I'm pretty sure I'm going to re-read it after reviewing it haha. \n IF you liked this review, go check out more on my blog, where I review YA and other genre books! \n http://keepcalmandloveboooks.blogspot.ca"}

{"text": "This book was twisty. I almost need to write my comments at the end of the 4th book.

{"text": "I wasn't really impressed by any of the stories. Try, it was an anthology, so the stories were novellas rather than more in-depth offerings, but I've read other collections where the authors shone within those restrictions."}
{"text": "Somewhere in this incredible tangle of words is a very simple story. \n Last year, a clever writer pulled that story out of this jumbled tale and threw it onto the big screen. I adored it. I adored it so much I bought it after I saw it once, then showed it to my friends and we all wound up bawling at the end. Then we had a deep conversation about God, fate, destiny, and miracles. \n None of that happened to me when reading this book. I was never moved. I never found the common thread. I never felt Peter's life had a greater purpose. The narrative follows him for awhile (with frequent side trails) and then he's gone for several hundred pages. I found myself reading the first chapter intently, and then skimming more and more as it went on. \n Many people love this book. They love the in-depth language. Me, I prefer more straightforward narratives. \"And she named the stars,\" does me just as well as 400 words on each star's name. The writer reminds me of Dickens, or Tolstoy, or Hugo. He gets so enthralled with his words that he leaves the actual plot for five or six pages on a regular basis, to describe things that have no real impact on the plot. Like the history of the city. Or how it looks in the light. \n In short, it is not my cup of tea. I prefer the angels and demons and miracles of the film, which tugs at my heart and whispers to me simple truths that ... if contained in this book at all, are lost under a great towering avalanche of words."}

{"text": "WELL THAT WAS AN INTERESTING EPILOGUE"}
{"text": "What a fascinating and imaginative book. This was just such a pleasant surprise. The synopsis was vague enough that I went into this without really knowing what to expect, but a couple of pages into the prologue I knew it was going to be good. \n If I'm being perfectly honest, to go into too much detail about the plot would 1) sound incredibly convoluted and 2) ruin a lot of the charm of this book. One of the things I enjoyed most about this book was the timing that information was revealed. You really only knew what you needed to know when you needed to know it. <-----Is that even a sentence? Does that make sense at all? What I can say, is this. Tarquin Norwich, a bastard of the worst kind, is determined to get his hands on a special book and it's author, a toymaker named Indigo Peachtree, for nefarious reasons. He sends his son Archie, who happens to be an actual decent human being, to find Pierce Landcross, a man that will lead them to the toymaker. Archie despises his father and wants nothing but to take his younger sister Clover and run away with his new secret bride to live happily anywhere far away. He agrees to retrieve Landcross and brings his little sister with him, where she will be safest. Then he will leave. In the meantime, Norwich and his son Ivor (who is almost as bad as his father) go after Landcross' brother Joaquin. Legacy focuses on each character's adventures whether they are being chased or doing the chasing. There are wonderful characters throughout, including a vampire, a magician, gypsies, and fairies oh my! (Sorry, Wizzard of Oz joke) There are also short stories peppered throughout and wonderful re-imaginings of myths like Robin Hood, King Arthur, and even Greek gods. I just loved it all. \n The first thirty pages or so after the prologue were a little hard for me to get into. I kept getting confused between Tarquin and Joaquin. Their names looked too similar on the page. There are also a lot of characters introduced really early in the book so it was a bit difficult to keep track of them and figure out where they fit in. Thankfully there came a point where everything just clicked into place. \n The book was filled with wonderfully complex characters that refused to be pigeon-holed as either good or bad. (I tried to find a way to avoid saying \"shades of gray\" because that phrase now bugs the hell out of me) I wanted to hate Archie for his lack of a backbone, but I couldn't. I wanted to like Joaquin but a sometimes he was enough of an ass that I just couldn't. Hell, even Ivor had his moments. You never really knew who to trust. But Landcross I always adored. And with each chapter, I loved him more and more. He was just charming as hell. My heart was all a flutter. \n I don't really know how I would classify this book but I think that's a lot of its charm. Steampunk? It has elements of Steampunk but it's subtle. Adventure? Sure. Fantasy? Yes. It clearly takes place in the past, so there are historical elements to it? I DON'T KNOW. Put it this way, if you enjoy Steampunk, Adventure, and/or fantasy, I heartily recommend. It also happens to be a series, so YAY. \n *I received a copy from the author in exchange for a fair and honest review."}

Eureka is a teenaged girl (16? 17?) who's never cried. Her mom and dad are divorced, and her mother Diana died a few months ago in a horrible mysterious wave. Eureka was with her, but somehow miraculously survived. She loved her mother very much and couldn't imagine a world without her and tried to take her own life by swallowing pills. Now, she is sentenced to therapy, even though she hates therapists - and I really can't blame her this one was intense - and she may or may not have feelings for her best friend Brooks who has started to act weird. \n Throw in a mysterious guy named Ander who doesn't really seem to exist and keeps stalking her, and a mysterious book that her mother left her in her will and things get very interesting for Eureka."}
{"text": "Well, I really did love the \"you have to be brilliant in math to get in\" part--but then you also need a touch of... well... pure magic. It's like grad school, only better. \n I like the cynical, hard-drinking nihilistic students too. \n My favorite part? When they get to be geese. \"All you think about is flapping, eating, and honking to retain contact with the formation.\" Then later, being unhappy and wishing he could just hide as a goose-- so good. I wish depression could be cured in such a way. \n The fantasy world, I thought, was the weakest part of it. At least it seemed almost unnecessary to me. Maybe in the sequel that will change. \n All in all--great fantasy for the slightly-older-than-Potter set."}
{"text": "Ho terminato questo libro da diverse ore, e sono ancora indecisa sul numero di stelline da attribuirgli. \n Se da un lato ho apprezzato l'ambientazione e l'originalita della trama, ed il fatto che la Bardugo abbia creato un mondo pieno di mistero e magia... In contrapposizione a tutto cio, ho avuto la netta sensazione che la storia non sia stata sviluppata al massimo delle sue potenzialita. \n Due orfani di guerra, Alina e Mal, due bambini cresciuti insieme all'ombra di un duca benefattore in attesa di sapere se faranno parte della prestigiosa famiglia dei Grisha. \n Cartografa lei, cercatore di piste lui, entrambi alla loro prima missione nelle file del primo esercito del re. \n Sono l'uno l'unica famiglia dell'altro, amicizia e fiducia ad unirli, ed un dolcissimo sentimento che alberga nel cuore di entrambi sara il catalizzatore delle loro scelte future. \n Tutto cambia dopo che Alina, per salvare Mal da morte certa, scopre quello per cui e nata: lei e una potentissima Grisha il suo dono e quello di Convocare la luce. \n Fino a questo punto ho amato sia lo stile della Bardugo, che il ritmo con il quale procedeva nella narrazione, ma capitolo dopo capitolo, la storia ha cominciato a stagnare nel mare delle descrizioni continue e ripetitive di caftani con risvolti d'oro e bordati da pregiate pellicce, e su di futili stati d'animo di questo o quell'altro Grisha. \n Persino la descrizione dell'ambiente e risultata eccessiva e superflua ai fini della trama: mi trovavo a saltare con gli occhi interi paragrafi, in attesa che l'autrice riprendesse il filo logico dei fatti, invece di divagare di continuo. \n Affascinante ed enigmatico il personaggio dell'Oscuro, capace per altro di riportare la trama un po' di vivacita, e stato uno dei \"cattivi\" per i quali ho perso la testa. \n Alina, per una volta non e la classica eroina bella che si sente inguardabile, anzi la sua trasformazione da brutto anatroccolo a \"cigno\" cioe Grisha, ha reso il suo personaggio alquanto interessante riuscendo a farmi \"tifare\" per lei sin da subito. \n Mal... Oh Mal tu sei la dulcezz che piu dulcezz non se po! \n Non ho dubitato nemmeno per un secondo del suo attaccamento per Alina, sapevo che avrebbe avrebbe protetto lei ad ogni costo e con un coraggio senza pari... Per una volta questo che sto leggendo e un triangolo ben descritto ed avvincente! \n Ma a parte il triangolo, i personaggi ben caratterizzati e l'ambientazione magica e ricca di descrizioni oniriche... \n La Bardugo, a mio modestissimo avviso, non ha saputo dare alla storia quel plus ultra che avrebbe reso il tutto piu interessante e particolare. \n Mi spiego, non sono riuscita a trovare, ne un minimo appiglio storico, n'e tanto meno una spiegazione ai tanti perche della trama, solo una sequela di risposte frammentarie e poco chiarificatrici. \n L'esistenza della guerra in se, sembra un capriccio del re o un esercizio tattico dell'Oscuro. \n Il primo esercito, il secondo esercito sembrano combattere non solo su due fronti diversi, ma addirittura due guerre distinte e separate. \n Il re mi e sembrato piu un fantoccio nelle mani dell'Oscuro, e quest'ultimo da temibile e spietato, viene bacchettato di continuo da una Grisha megera, che poi si rivelera a lui imparentata... Boh nesso logico dice sei? \n Tutti ma proprio tutti, non si rendono conto che l'oscuro sta per fregarli alla grande? \n Uno che si fa chiamare oscuro ha come fine la pace ed il trionfo del bene sull'oscurita? \n Chiedo scusa per la mia \"tardaggine\" ma tutto era alquanto palese! \n Avevo enormi aspettative su questa serie, anche per via dell'altro raiting su goodreads, ma al momento ho letto solo un bel triangolo, un cattivo sexy, un coraggioso innamorato e mi sono fatta una cultura sul guardaroba dei Grisha! \n Bardugo impegnati di piu nel seguito... Voglio piu action e meno haute couture!!!"}
{"text": "Excellent \n An excellent conclusion with twists and turn that you don't see coming!! Highly recommend reading the first books and finishing here!"}
{"text": "4.5 Stars. Pretty freaking awesome! \n This book was rather spectacular. I have to say there was a moment or two of predicatability, but that didn't keep me from reading on. This book is smart and dark and intriguing. It opens us to a world of evil and corruption, and the flaws of humanity. The story was very fast-paced and elegantly woven and did play out as a movie in my head. The back and forth time skips definitely helped with that effect. I love thinking about the possibility of EOs and finding out different powers. I would definitely recommend this book."}

{"text": "WOW! \n : I don't know where to start. Ok here goes. \n I have always adored Greek gods and goddesses yet I don't know much about any of them. I basically knew Zeus, Hades, Philoctetes, Hera, Hermes and Hercules in the Disney movie - Hercules; I knew Perseus, Poseidon, and Andromeda in the movie - Clash of the Titans - and that was about it. I didn't know there were so many gods... \n I came to know about this book after I had already watched the movie. I've been told that the movie sucked and that the book was ten times better, you know, I actually liked the movie especially having Logan Lerman in it. Then I finished this novel and I was struck. YEP, the movie didn't do justice to the book AT ALL, but it was acceptable enough. \n I loved how the author perceived a young boy's perspective clearly, never failing to make me laugh with witty yet humorous lines. It was a fast paced book; I just finished it in a day! \n The story was compelling and gripping that you just can't put the book down. It has the perfect mixture of elements that keeps the readers interested and in the end, you just feel so good that you read the book. \n Read this if you are a fan of adventure and fantasy!"}

{"text": "Well...I can't say that I am surprised by how much I loved this book. I pretty much know that every one of Molly Harper's books are going to become my new favorite. \n This novel had everything I loved about Harper's Jane Jameson series. All the previous characters were there, except many were only mentioned in others' conversations. The new characters that were introduced fit seamlessly into the world I adore and helped the story continue on for me. \n Iris and her sister GiGi....what can I say. Hilarious and remarkably real feeling. I don't have a sister, but I have enough friends who do, so I can say the way characters behave toward each other felt realistic and natural. With any of Harper's stories, witty dialogue filled the entire book. Cal was an OK love interest. I love this story, don't get me wrong, but vampire leading men are all kind of starting to look/sound/act the same all across this genre. I guess I just wanted to read about a vampire male with a little extra something that made him stand out from all the others, even some of the females are feeling a little clone-like to me....I digress \n The plot was not too, too epic. Finding out why vampires are engaging in unknown acts of violence?! \n Boring........and been done. \n It didn't bother me a whole lot however, I guess, because I just love this world so much. I don't need some wild, intricate mystery where the villain is always one step ahead, and when \"all's revealed\" you are left dumbstruck and forever changed. This is light, fluffy, paranormal chick lit and I loved it. \n Pacing was good. I didn't find myself skimming or by-passing entire paragraphs because I really was engaged with the characters story lines. Those who haven't read the Jane Jameson series might be a little lost in respects to the setting and/or supporting characters. There wasn't a whole lot of world-building, which was expected. \n Overall, I really enjoyed this book. I will always instant-a-buy Molly Harper's work. I love her writing and stories she weaves. They are light and funny and just enough to pull me out of any reading funk I sometimes find myself in. I recommend this one to anyone and everyone!"}

{"text": "This book was very refreshing. I haven't read much in the way of fiction dealing with mental health issues; those I have read are not very consistent and quite often are written with harsh stereotypes in mind. \n This is not one of those. It was perfectly on point in the relevant information about the diseases and phenomena relayed. The descriptions of Ali's synesthesia was quite interesting; it is easy to understand why she would think that she was nuts at first. \n The way that she could see rotten fruit was particularly intriguing, I personally can smell when something is off much sooner than others, so I don't find this to be a big stretch at all. I am absolutely looking forward to following up with the rest of this series. Definitely recommend."}
{"text": "This is the Great Gatsby of children's literature. J. M. Barrie has done for childhood what F. Scott Fitzgerald did for the American Dream. It really is a perfect storm: it captures the whimsy and magic of childhood, it's prose is so beautiful it's basically poetry, and the story and themes have the richness and depth of classic literature. It is a tremendously fun, witty, and exciting novel that could also be studied endlessly. And Barrie's charismatic and charming narration just makes it all the better. I will say though, that the prose is so decorated that the novel can feel a bit dense (especially for a children's novel) and the pacing suffers a bit. You can see the tremendous influence this story has had on both fantasy and children's literature. I have more to read in classic children's lit, but it will be extremely difficult to find a suitable rival for this imaginative masterpiece."}

{"text": "I found this story unique and engaging. It tells the tale of David who has been searching for his brother for 50 years. As his desperation increases he turns to a church and prays for help. Help arrives in the form of angel Jophiel. \n David has led a vampire's life but he is not like the other vampire's who roam the earth and live in the sewers, avoiding the Brotherhood, an organisation who hunt down and kill vampires. David's mission to find his brother Danny means he risks his life as he searches. \n Jophiel is tasked with helping David and is convinces he does have a soul. He joins David on his journey and finds himself tempted in ways he never expected. \n Be prepared for some angel sex which is pretty spectacular! \"He let his soul seek out David's as he rose up, let his heart sing, and chronicled every second, every unnecessary breath and gasp and sigh and squeak between them.\" \n Vampires, angels, the mystery of Danny, attacks by the Brotherhood and temptations of the flesh - there's a lot going on and it makes for an interesting and engaging story. Things get even more interesting when David and Jophiel meet Arthur which adds a whole other layer of complexity. \n The downside to this book? Yes, there's a pretty big one - the story just ended! I was left thinking what happened? it can't just end there! I understand there might be a sequel but when? It would be a real shame for the story not to continue so fingers crossed that a sequel is published! \n This is a 4 star read! \n I publish all my m/m reviews on my blog so if you want to see all my m/m reviews in one place come visit at Because Two Men Are Better Than One!"}
{"text": "For more reviews, check out Keep Calm and Love Books \n This book follows Alexander the Great, yes the same one we learn about in high school, in his teenage years to becoming the king of Macedonia . It takes place in 360 BC, which is just crazy to read about in Herman's amazing descriptive text. This did take me a while to read and get into but that's only because of the amount of characters with crazy long ancient names. I needed time to remember the roles some of these people played in our protagonist's storylines. With that in mind, there were A LOT of different character arcs. I actually really liked Herman's writing and the distinguishing between the characters, it was really fun and different to read about this mysterious, unknown time period from a historian's (Eleanor Herman) mind. \n For everyone's storyline, we have 3 main plots: Alexander, Katerina and Zofia's. Among those we then have the minor plots with different P.O.V chapters: Jacob, Hephaestion, Cynane, and Olympia. It sounds really confusing but it wasn't! I liked how we heard from everyone's head and it gave us more perspective on the story and world we're set in. Speaking of the word, this takes place in, again, 360 BC, so the Gods and Goddesses from Greek mythology are pretty prominent in this. We always get references about how not long ago the Gods roamed the earth. I really liked the incorporation of mythology and how we frequently get references of Zeus, Ares, Oracle of Delphi, Athena etc. Again, Herman is a historian so it does not surprise me that she included history that's pretty accurate to today's knowledge. \n This is a quote from the Author's Note at the end of the book: \n \"Though this is a work of fantasy with some fictional main characters--Katerina, Jacob, and Zofia--I wanted to make their world of 340 BC as historically accurate as possible... While Alexander's half sister, Cynane, might feel too modern, she really did model herself on the Amazons and was known for her military prowess....His father, the king, was distant and harsh; his manipulative, ambitious mother was devoted to her snakes and widely regarded as a witch; his older half sister, Cynane, was a jealous, competitive Amazon; his younger half brother, Arrhideus, was mentally handicapped; and his tutor, Leonidas, employed educational methods that would today land him in jail for child abuse.\" \n I loved how accurate this was and it really does make me want to read more of her work. \n Now, for the actual characters and storylines, the only plot that really advanced in the beginning was Princess Zofia. Right away, her story just goes to the max with drama and she has to fight for what she wants and realize the dangers outside of her well protected and sheltered life in the palace. We left her story very open ended and I'm excited to see how her's will end in the sequel. I also just really want her to help with the war in Pella and meet everyone. We start the book off in Katerina's P.O.V and we can already tell she's not normal. She definitely has some strong magic coursing through her veins and I liked how the book ended with her owning her true self and I'm so excited to see her embrace herself fully. Heph, Alexander's best friend (even in history), was pretty dull, but I still liked hearing his thought. His one problem, which clearly states in the book, is his pride. I really found his pride annoying at times but towards the end, like everything, he was just getting better and I think he's going to be a great hero in the end. \n My favourite storyline had to be between Kats and Cynane, Alexander's sister. Something about her abrasive manner and how she'll do anything to prove she doesn't want to be just a lady (GoT's Arya basically) was amazing. From the start of her P.O.V chapter, I knew I'd like her. \n \"As she slips through the crowd, she intentionally brushes against different men. She's not sure why she does it--to remind herself of her power over them, perhaps? Or maybe because even through the coarse cloth of her dress, it feels kind of thrilling when they touch--as if anything could happen.\" \n I just feel like there are so many great moments in this book that I need to quote them all for you guys. If you need convincing to read this book at all, just look at all of the glorious reviews it has. This book was amazing and I can say it is my favourite read in 2016 so far. I can't remember a book I read that just left me speechless and MAKE me want to search the web to find out more of the stuff that conspired in 360 BC. Guys, just read it. It's simply amazing and I am now going to read Eleanor Herman's other novels. \n Here are some quotes to persuade you further: \n Alexander's P.O.V: \n \"Down on the street, a man driving an empty cart is cursing bitterly, trying to back up his donkey and cart to make way for another vehicle. That's how it is, Alex thinks. Someone always has to give in. But not for long. He has other plans, plans his father doesn't know about. And if he succeeds, he'll be the greatest leader this world has ever known.\" \n Cynane's P.O.V: \n \"True loyalty--it's almost unheard of. And it's exactly what Cyn has been looking for all these years. Correction: it's what she has been looking to destroy.\" \n Katerina's P.O.V: \n \"\"There was, long ago, in the time before time, a great battle between gods and monsters,\" Ada begins, looking straight ahead. \"The gods won but lost much of their power and became almost mortal, mating with humans.\"\" \n Hephaestion's P.O.V: \n \"\"Kat, you're going to be all right,\" he lies. She doesn't answer. She's looking in wonder at the sky, moving her pale lips. He turns to see what it is that so fascinates her. It's the hellion, flying in wide lazy circles over the battlefield, howling as it rises higher and higher, and is gone.\" \n I am so excited to read Herman's sequel to the Blood of Gods and Royals series, Empire of Dust."}
{"text": "I received a review copy of this book via Goodreads' Don't Buy My Love program in exchange for an honest review. \n STUNG is set in an alternate Victorian era--one where there has been a plague that turned humans to zombies. In this world, debtors have been rounded up and sent to work camps in order to pay off their debts. \n Victor isn't a debtor, he's a singer. One who made a pass at his patron and has been sent to the Honeyhill work camp as a punishment. Victor is immediately intrigued by the frank looks he receives from the camp's chief security officer, Mr. Crunch. Crunch isn't the actual name for this behemoth, but it is the sound made when Crunch cuts down zombies with his machete. \n Crunch could avail himself of any of the prisoners on the work camp, but he's not interested in rape. Something about the pretty Victor really turns his head however. He believes if he makes a special effort to keep Victor safe the man may reciprocate with some affection. \n In fact, both men are harboring secrets other than their sexuality. Upon his arrival, Victor falls in with a group of captives planning an escape attempt. Meanwhile, Crunch is an operative, a soldier in the Humanist army who want to take down the work camp. \n After a few secret trysts, suspicions are raised. Sharpe, a former inmate turned guard, begins spying on Crunch to see if there are any activities he can unearth to topple Crunch's authority. He even brutalizes Victor in order to get cooperation, to no avail. \n A botched escape attempt infuriates Crunch, who not only must rescue Victor from the zombies outside the camp, he must now punish the man for whom he has affection. Who could have guessed that their alliance would be he necessary ingredient to take down the work camp for the Humanists? \n I really enjoyed the world-building here. And the Zombie garden with the zombified bees was truly creepy. The interactions between Crunch and Victor were brief, but powerful. I kinda felt like they took too many risks, however. That seemed a bit unrealistic, considering the homophobia of the period. \n It was a solid, interesting read, however. The language was beautiful and evocative. I could almost smell the sweet-rot of the apiary."}

{"text": "A few months ago, I would not ever have considered reading another vampire series - it just wasn't a genre that I was much interested in. Recently I have found myself getting a hold of more paranormal type books, and this series started to intrigue me. \n I will admit, it took me several tries (3) before I made it past the first few chapters. If I read too many books too quickly, I get invested in certain characters and it's hard for me to keep the details straight in new books that I start, which is what happened when I began reading this one. I gave myself a day or so break, tried again, and it worked! \n After I got all of the characters and dhampir vs moroi vs everything else settled in my head, I found this to be an enjoyable read. It didn't completely pick up for me until the end, but I did not ever really get bored reading the rest - I really like reading about boarding school situations, and was having fun learning about how their world works. \n One thing I couldn't figure out was who was depicted on the front cover. Actually, if this book (and the rest of the series) hadn't been blogged about and featured on other book websites, I would probably not have picked it up because of the cover. \n Book Cover: 2/5 \n Book Title: 4/5 \n Plot: 7/10 \n Characters: 7/10 \n Writing: 8/10 \n Ending: 9/10 \n Overall: 37/50"}

In the book, it's mentioned that it's been a year since the events in Revelations, but I'm trying to do the math and it just doesn't work out that way. It was March/April at the end of book 3, and this one picks up in August right before Jack and Mimi's senior year, and Bliss and Schuyler are both sixteen. A year hasn't passed.

{"text": "October 22nd, 2014. \n This book was packed with action, significantly more so than the first two, so much however that the psychological insight, the inner life of the character which I so loved in the precedent installments of the series, finds itself quite set aside. Not that there isn't; there is much character growth. We see Ronan coming to terms with things he was afraid of even giving a name to in Dream Thieves, things he had kept secret; we see Adam ending up much more adult than I'd first expected him to be; Gansey and Blue's relationship struggles to find a new path without defining itself. All this admitted, the book still felt like an interlude, moving some rocks out of the way of the plot and paving the way for the great finish. \n How is this possible? There are many new exciting characters, events, development! And yet it doesn't feel enough, because sadly hardly any of this is given time and space to breathe. Its flaw is that there is too much action in too little space. \n Take, for instance, the villain: on the outside, he's exciting and menacing, powerful, capable of ruining the Gray Man's life, omnipresent while keeping himself at the outskirts of the main stage. \n And this is all of it. What do we know of Greenmantle? We know nothing of how he became who he is, we know nothing of how he acquired what power he has, nothing at all of his inner life. We know little of his relationship with his wife, how it came to be, why in the whole wide world they love each other and decided to get married, why do they sometimes act little like actual people, if at all. Their development is left to the imagination of the reader. When Piper behaves in a weird, probably magic-induced way, there is no given explanation -- no insight, no reflection, no sign of what's going on in her head except for her later actions, which also feel pretty much out of the blue. Then Greenmantle leaves. We do not get to know anything about his involvement with Ronan's father, we do not get to know his plans for the Greywaren, we do not get to know his real deep motive, he's just gone . It's so unsatisfying and disappointing. It feels unfinished, like this is the outline of a plot to be filled, like more should happen, more should be told. \n These villains feel like the childish idea of a villain, with potential for greatness, but no substance, no real life -- like the cardboard cutout of a character. \n That can be also said of Jesse Dittley - sweet guy, but his cartoonish portrayal felt slightly distasteful, at least in my opinion. What was meant to be conveyed by the all-caps, for instance, could've been made to understand by the use of simple adjectives, or one of Stiefvater's descriptions, which can be beautiful. It's definitely irksome, and a faux pas. \n I shall not say the same for Gwenllian because I hope her character will be explored in the next book, but if not so -- well. She is potentially very interesting. \n However unhappy I am with the form, I cannot say so of the content. I am so profoundly delighted by it! I am in love with everything and everyone -- I love Adam wholeheartedly again, or maybe for the first time; I love Ronan and his small steps towards some freedom, Blue and Gansey and their dependence of late night phone calls, Blue and her finally exploring of her powers. \n I particularly appreciated the handling of Blue's rage towards her mother and Blue's grief for Persephone's death. I felt like that was very well done. \n Lastly, I want more of Gansey in parallel with Glendower."}

{"text": "This was a good read, but it is an unfinished story. One character was completely abandoned. As usual for Ward, the editing was poorly done."}
{"text": "Not bad enough to dismiss entirely but not good enough to be consistently enjoyable. My main issue with this book is that is way too long for how thin the plot is. Relatedly, the world building here is quite shallow and unimpressive and the pacing is poor. There just wasn't enough information here about caster mythos, and the relationships casters build with each other and with the mortal world. Outside of the constant, monotonous hand wringing about Lena's impending \"claiming\" (where she will have to become a dark caster or a light caster) I get very little sense of what it means to be a caster, how caster magic works, how common or uncommon casters are, how they use their powers, etc. \n Part of the reason why this claiming plotline becomes unsatisfying is because the stakes feel very low until the very end of the book. Since the book's primary villain exists offstage until the climax or at least seemingly offstage , and the secondary dark caster villain is laughably unintimidating, there is no sense of what the threat of becoming a dark actually means. Does becoming dark mean Lena will become homicidal, or just a brat with a fondness for lollipops (yes, this book features menacing lollipops)? What do adult light casters and dark casters actually do with themselves? Despite the characters incessant hand wringing about impending doom, the actual ramifications of \"going dark\" remain opaque throughout most of the book. \n Instead of fleshing out the fantasy elements, this book is larded with descriptive detail about the town of Gatlin and its denizens, and typical teenage problems. The coverage of Gatlin rednecks and cliched high school hijinks became super repetitive. \n As for the romance between the narrator Ethan and Lena, it is better than the execrable Twilight but it is still a too joyless and angsty to be convincing. \n Now I said this book isn't bad enough to dismiss outright. Here are some of the things I liked about it: \n 1. I really liked the way the authors handled the death of Ethan's mom and Ethan's thoughts/reactions. These parts of the book were quite poignant and well written \n 2. The second magical plotline (about an enchanted locket and a doomed pair of lovers during the Civil War) was good, and tied nicely into the main plot \n 3. Some of the supporting characters were well drawn \n In short, a deeply flawed book with flashes of promise."}

It was a bit disappointing because he had such a beautiful lanscape (Oregon) to work with."}

She is eventually sent to a school for \"people like her\", but what does that mean \"people like her\"? Forsaken is a well written book with relatable and likable characters a reader can identify with. The reader often feels like they can connect with Hannah as they follow her on her adventure of mystery and discovery. I would definitely suggest this to any Percy Jackson fans out there; it has the same modern mythological feel. This book is the beginning of a great series and if the first book is any indication of the rest of the Daughters of the sea series, it will definitely hold its own against heavy hitters like Percy Jackson, Twilight, and Harry Potter. A great read, would definitely recommend it, especially to anyone who loves myths."}

It's been quite a while since I was a child caught between the obliviousness of youth and the bittersweet awareness of a teen, but it seems spot on to me. Oppel deals with some harsh issues here, but The Nest is a truly cathartic thriller that has a nicely realistic ending despite all the craziness that precedes it. Without sappy sentiment, readers will be reminded that imperfections are beautiful, and the love and the care of a family is messy and wonderful, and something to be cherished."}

{"text": "Another spectacular story by Tina Pollick. Thank you for an early read! \n This page turner is all sexy, thrilling and frightening. A perfect mix for a gripping read! \n Three years prior, two jaded adults -- one who lives in our realm, and the other is a soul broker \"owned\" by an evil woman named Olesha in the depths of hell-- had a bump-in(literally) as strangers, and realizing the chemistry between them, they figure it's time to give love another chance. Drew is a complete flirt, and Mackenzie has this shy charm about her, which makes the agreement to have a dinner date the next night even the sweeter. Especially when things took a naughty turn at the end of the night, ;) \n Only, when Mackenzie wakes up the next morning and he's no where to be found, she's furious. She has no earthly idea what he is, a mere \"soul broker trophy\" who was summoned back \"home\" that night, and spends the next three years chained in the throne room for his earthly encounter with the human girl. \n Things quickly become frightening when Olesha comes to Drew with a new task. He must return to earth, revisit Mackenzie, and bring back what she feels, as his master, belongs to her. His three year old daughter Sophie. \n He agrees to it, then us as a reader, we wonder if he will fight for love, or do as his master says. \n Tina has quite a talent at keeping things suspenseful, magical, and goodness must I add, sexy. She completely proves not everything from hell is completely evil! Drew has made it to my Dreamy Book Boyfriend list, he's amazing! Not only is he steaming hot, but he has this emotional depth to him that just makes a girl want to cry. I really, really don't want to spoil my reasoning's for this statement. Go, go, get your copy now! \n 5 stars for this paranormal romance thriller!"}
{"text": "First, I LOVE THIS COVER. Love it. Before I even knew what it was about or read anything about it at all, I loved the cover. Once I actually got to see it in person, I had to start reading it right away because I loved the cover so much. \n Now that I am done reading it, I can also say I LOVE THIS BOOK! The title \"The Extraordinary Secrets of April, May & June\" very accurately describes what the book is about, and much to my pleasant surprise the book is split up by chapter - one chapter written by April, one by May, and one by June, in a rotation. \n Each of their voices was so clear and distinct I didn't have to read \"May said\" or \"June exclaimed\" to know who had said it. The banter between the characters was quick and witty - some of the most realistic dialogue I have read in a long time. \n The \"secrets\" of the sisters weren't used in a cliche or too powerful way, either. This allowed me to enjoy the plot a lot more, knowing one of them wasn't going to swoop in and solve everything just because of their extra powers. \n This is my favorite book of 2010, by far."}
{"text": "Great sequel. Naturally continues the story very well while developing the characters more fully. I've already started reading the third book. Sometimes it pays to wait until the whole series is complete before beginning to read it."}
{"text": "Fun, though when you read so many ghost stories together like this, you realize how the basic plots show up over and over again. 1. Someone encounters an evil ghost and flees in horror. 2. Someone sees a loved one acting strange; realizes later that the loved one was ALREADY DEAD. Et cetera. But there are enough variations to make it enjoyable. Some are genuinely original and wonderfully creepy."}
{"text": "See full review for Darkest Mercy at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n After three years, I finally finished this crazy series about faeries. Book 5, like books 1 and 3, covers our main characters - The Summer King and Queen. Keenan is missing, but he hasn't been taken by anyone. You learn fairly quickly that after what happened in book 3, he went off on his own to figure out what he wanted. Not just as a king, but as a faerie. Ash is handling the Summer Court well in his absence and only wishes that he will return because of what is going on with Niall and Bannach. War is threatening and she needs her King. Especially because Seth isn't really seeing her these days, not until she chooses, which man she'll be with. \n Out of all five books in this series, I think this one was probably my favorite."}

{"text": "4.5 stars. If you enjoyed The Bone Season or Red Rising, chances are you will love this book as well. It switches between two perspectives, one male and one female, one from the privileged class which can compete for government roles, one from a lower class who becomes a spy in the home of the other's evil mother in an attempt to save her brother who was taken by the \"masks\". I was distracted at the beginning of the book and it took a while to figure out who was good, bad, upper class, lower class, etc. but it clicked once I was finally paying more attention. The change of perspectives and the timing of the changes was well done. The ending really sets you up for the next book."}
{"text": "This review was written for Joyfully Jay reviews and can be accessed here: http://joyfullyjay.com/2016/12/review... \n 4.25 stars. \n Cora is a nurse with an undeniable attraction for Zeke, a handsome orderly. Despite her repeated attempts to ignore and avoid him, she's inexplicably drawn into his orbit time and again. At the holiday party, she and Zeke come face to face, along with Zeke's boyfriend, Merrick. Merrick isn't enthused about Cora, sensing there's an attraction he doesn't want Zeke to pursue, but that's all moot when the gas main explodes below them and Cora wakes up chained to the wall in a desolate cabin. \n Zeke and Merrick eventually turn up to explain to Cora that she's being chained for her own good. She'd been nearly killed by the explosion, but Zeke infected her with a vampire virus that healed her mortal wounds. The catch is, if Cora will remain bound and not take any blood from either Zeke or Merrick, her fever will abate and she'll go back to being human in about a week. \n Unfortunately, at first Cora doesn't believe Zeke or Merrick, whose cold eyes stun her into submission. She breaks free and must be collected before she can do harm. That does convince her of her otherworldly status, however, and she's not that upset over it. Her human life was sterile and empty, and being a vampire, witnessing the passion between Zeke and Merrick, makes her crave both of them. She wants to join them, though she's afraid that Merrick will never accept her. \n This is a really compelling, sensual read. Cora narrates the whole novella, and she's clearly a vivid thinker. Plus, once she's infected, her viewpoint becomes distorted and hazy, with a sing-song quality that lulled me along. I dug it. There's a little bit of sex, in the middle and the end, with M/M, M/F and MMF arrangements. Cora's a big player, though, in her own transformation and with saving the relationship between Zeke and Merrick--and also their fledgling triad. I loved her strength. I loved how she made it work for all three of them. Merrick's guilt over being a vampire is sincere, and he becomes a far more sympathetic character when viewed in this light. By the end, it's an emotional rollercoaster, with Cora saving Merrick saving Zeke and then happy menage sexytimes. Yum. \n This book is part of the 2016 Holiday Charity Bundle from Riptide, with 20% of proceeds going toward The Trevor Project. Having read all three books in that package, I HIGHLY recommend it."}

{"text": "I am so happy my first book of this year was so wonderful. For me it's like a 4.5 just because I found some of the writing repetitive. Meira didn't need to explain herself so many times. Also there was a weird mix between casual voice and flowery describing voice that didn't mix well for me. But that's about it: onto the good stuff! \n I liked that I didn't know where this story was going. I had somethings pegged from the beginning but in terms of the world development and the turns the adventure took, I couldn't have predicted it at all. I like when a book surprises me. \n I enjoyed Meira as a lead. She was a fierce leading lady and I liked all of her variety in terms of personality. It was a good strong female lead, with a balance of her nature and nurture coming out at various moments in the story. \n Oddly enough, this love triangle didn't bother me. The only time it did was when the two men fought each other which I found to be lame but overall, since it was a small part of the story and don't consume all of it, I didn't mind it. Which is hard to do because o don't like love triangles. \n Overall, I enjoyed this story and this world immensely. I look forward to what it has in store and specifically for the growth of Meira as a character."}

{"text": "I picked up this book because it had a girl with a sword on the cover, and I have long been a fan of Tamora Pierce and her ilk. I was a bit disappointed by the story, though. If you're just looking for a classic Arthurian-style knight-adventurer story with a female protagonist, this may answer very well. If you want a story about a young girl kicking butt with more modern sensibilities, you may want to look elsewhere. The author also used a lot of archaic language and made some questionable grammatical choices in places, which I, as a fairly well-read adult, had occasional difficulty deciphering. Some of the vocabulary is well beyond the average 9 to 12-year-old reader, who would seem to be the book's intended audience. That said, I would probably have liked the story more if I had first read it at 12 than I do having first read it as an adult."}
{"text": "An amazing set of short stories. Original, creative, science-based; I can easily understand why some of them are award winners. Exploring alternate realities, Judeo-christian myths, free will vs. destiny, good vs. evil, etc... Each one of the stories fully explores a \"What if..?\" idea and in a way I've never read before. They're not typical \"Sci-fi\" stories, many take place in the past and have strong religious themes. They raise theological and philosophical questions that make you think about the central idea/premise in the stories. \n Would read again, and would definitely recommend."}
{"text": "As much as I found myself wanting a sequel to the Last Werewolf ... this wasn't what I was envisioning. The story itself is okay, but I found it frustratingly cluttered sometimes."}
{"text": "This is book 5 in the Vampire Erotic Theater Romance Series and I must admit that this is the first book that I have read in this series. I was worried that I may have had to read the others to get the story but this wasn't so, all it did was increase my interest and made me want to get to know the other characters who featured towards the end of the book. \n This book is Payne's book. He is part vampire and part incubus, his incubus side able to bend people to fulfill his sexual desires. Payne has never accepted his incubus side, constantly struggling to keeping it at bay and thinks of himself as a vampire first. Payne is of course tall, lean and stunningly handsome he radiates danger and has an intensity about him. Payne is in the underground town looking for a witch he has heard may be able to help his vampire friends. She may hold the answers to a binding spell that is keeping Chicca his friend Andreu's mate bound to the club Vampirerotique, he has heard there is a ring which can bind the person wearing it to another person therefore allowing Chicca to leave the club. Desperate to help his friends he will do whatever it takes to get the ring. \n Payne stumbles across and come to the rescue of Elissa a witch who is under attack. He soon comes to realize that her deceased sister is who he has been looking for. Elissa knows how to get Payne the ring and in return he has to help her recover something from the same person. They set off on a journey, were there is danger, personal truths uncovered and a burning, dangerous passion. \n The thing I love about Felicity's books is that it's like watching a movie I can see it all playing out in my head as I'm reading, so me her books are always perfect escapism!!! \n Payne, wow, what can i say. He is moody, dark, dangerous and tormented but he also has an emotional side and a sad back story to explain why he is the way he is. I loved Elissa, it's so nice to read a book where the leading lady is sure of herself, confident and kick ass. The chemistry between the two has H.O.T, especially the bedroom scenes, but it becomes more than that and you can see the closeness and intimacy develop between the two characters. \n I can't wait to go back and enjoy the rest of the series :)"}
{"text": "I'm kind of on the fence with this one... \n I liked it, but I don't think I will be reading any further books in the series. \n This was sooo slow. It was almost torturous at times. I really hate to abandon books, and this one really tested my resolve. \n I think lovers of this genre have all read about boarding/special schools that contain kids with gifts/powers many times over. That premise doesn't put me off as long as the story develops its own uniqueness somewhere along the way. Scott kinda did that, sort of. How the \"gifted\" kids were going to school along kids that weren't was a new one for me. The categories of different powers were confusing at times and I wish there was more of an explanation. The writing was Ok. It wasn't overly done, descriptions were written well and helped world-build organically. There weren't tons of info-dumps which was nice. \n The characters....hmmmm...pretty cliche and forgettable. Dancia was the typical \"pretty but doesn't believe it\" female main character that has this extraordinary powerful gift. Can was boring as the \"good guy\" and Jack was boring as the \"bad boy\". All of the characters were really 2 dimensional and had a cut & paste-templete feel. \n This book just didn't get me invested in the series. It had potential, but just feel short in my opinion."}

{"text": "While not all of my questions were answered in this first book, I truly enjoyed getting to know Caleb and Maggie. I really felt for Maggie early on and connected with her ability to move on after her world gets turned upside down. She wasn't running towards a future, but she was definitely taking steps forward no matter how many people tried to crush her. \n Kyle had waited years to get Maggie to himself, even though he was never to entertain thoughts of dating. When she finally says yes, Fate pushes Maggie past him and into her soul mate, Caleb, who is Kyle's cousin. Kyle has no chance. Caleb is adoring. Maggie is struggling to see who she is and whom she can become. Oh, did I mention a family fued ad supernatural powers? \n While a lot is going on here, the crux of this story is love, acceptance, and forgiveness."}
{"text": "Sophie Bloom is a survivor. She has to be, she's the reincarnation of Persephone, the Greek goddess of spring. She and her boyfriend Kyrillos--Hades' son--had a big plan to defeat both Zeus and Hades and claim Olympus for themselves--oh and for Demeter, Persephone's mother. But Persephone truly planned to double-cross them all and claim Olympus for herself. That's why Demeter stabbed her. \n Fast forward seventeen years. \n The titan Prometheus, has sacrificed his powers to transfer Persephone's memories and goddess essence into a child, Sophie Bloom, who is celebrating her seventeenth birthday. She knows all about Persephone's schemes and is struggling to connect to Kai--Kyrillos--being her boyfriend. Even more so since he knows Persephone planned to kill him all those years ago. But, in order to stop the destruction of humanity by Zeus and Hades, Sophie and Kai need to perform a ritual on the first day of spring that requires their complete love for each other in order to work. \n Too bad the Equinox is seven days away. \n Sophie has trained hard to master her goddess powers, but she can't escape the disturbing visions she's having of a world filled with destruction--and herself being the center of the maelstrom. Then she goes and mouths off to Demeter again. Same old, same old--even if it's Sophie, not Persephone, butting heads. Demeter has her BFF Hecate, goddess of witchcraft, curse Sophie right back into Hades. \n Yeah. But this time it's Sophie trapped in Persephone's form in the days just prior to her inglorious demise. \n Now Sophie must get Kyrillos to see through the magic to fall in love with herself, not Persephone. Oh, and to win over Prometheus as an ally. Oh, and to convince Hephaestus to help them all escape Hades before Demeter gets stabby. \n It's a tough challenge, but meet it Sophie will--or else humanity is doomed. If only Sophie could find the strength within herself to accept her fate, and love herself. Because, really, what greater power than love could a goddess have? \n Like the first two books in the series, this one rockets forward into the action. There are many characters that play an important role, but Sophie is the heroine front-and-center. She saves herself, Persephone, humanity and her BFF's in the process. Her sharp wit keeps the tone engaging. At times, I wanted to pull a Cher in \"Moonstruck\"--and smack her good--just to get her to see that LOVE was the answer she couldn't seem to find. In all, the series is fun, innocent and creative. If nothing else, reading these books will get you ready for Greek Mythology category on JEOPARDY...but that's only one small reason to read them. \n I received an advanced reviewer's copy of this book via NetGalley."}
{"text": "So I got this book off a free offer through B&N, not knowing what to expect. The description lead me to believe that the guys were in a relationship with each other as well as with other women, so I was hoping this would be a queer, polyamourous relationship. I was disappointed. The author goes to great lengths to describe just how close these two are, but then does better gymnastics than the protagonist to 'no homo' the guys from any contact or feelings other than the \"brotherly\" type... I left feeling a bit queer-baited, but maybe that's just me. \n Other than that, the plot and writing are about what you would expect from your standard paranormal romance. It's a light read at only 165 pages and the pacing is quick. The sex scenes are steamy, even with the two guys apparently having been the only guys in history to figure out how to not touch once while having a threesome. The villain storyline seemed a little superfluous and only added for *Drama*, but that wasn't needed when there was adequate drama in the tension between the three characters. \n Overall, not a bad read. I don't regret picking it up, especially for free. Just know that it's definitely for the hetero seeking set of readers."}
{"text": "See full review for Blue Moon at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n From what I remember about my previous read through of this series - up to book 3 - Blue Moon was not my favorite and it was mostly because of how easily Ever lost Damen and her friends. It pissed me off to no end that after the hell that she went through in the last book, she still couldn't get her happy ending. Of course, now that I'm reading it again, I'm still annoyed, but at the same time I'm also annoyed with Ever for not trying to help sooner and for trusting all the wrong people. I mean, there was a reason that she didn't trust Ava in the last book. And the fact that she still trusted Roman despite the fact that he admitted that he was going to kill Damen was just downright stupid."}
{"text": "Loved this book fiercely, gah!"}
{"text": "** spoiler alert ** \n I would've rated this book higher. It was interesting premise, a quick read that twisted romance, paranormal, and book industry into one nice package. However, that package was slightly broken. It was a fight to read this when my eyes kept noticing editorial problems. How can I tell the difference between the narrator's thoughts and the dialogue if they keep dropping quotation marks and throwing them in odd places? I kept having to reread paragraphs to make sure that \"cold\" really meant \"could\". Someone was spacing out. Did it do what it intended to? Not totally, because you kept getting distracted from the story by stupid, easily fixable errors. Having said that, the epilogue was hilarious, especially when she kept describing how certain groups. \"Celebrities taste like silicone\"! Priceless, and certainly almost worth the time!"}

Marcus seeks out some of his angel friends for help to find these answers and to protect Amelia, but sometimes the answers we find are not the ones we want to hear !! \n For me this series has gotten stronger and stronger with each book, Amazon does say that these can be read as stand alone books but you get so much more by reading them in order. I love the way the author brings back the characters from other books and also introduces you to new ones without it feeling to full of character and a who's who. It was great to visit Apollyon, Lucas, Einar and there ladies again and to have them all working together was great. \n This book had everything for me, a hot leading man, strong leading lady, HOT bedroom scenes, plot twists, action and adventure and so much more !!!"}

{"text": "4.5 - 5 GORGEOUS STARS \n \"No rules. Live out loud. Find the sunshine.\" \n Simply stunning!! Emma Scott writes THE most lyrical and gorgeous fiction. Nik and Fiona have a permanent place in my heart! \n Called a contemporary romance \"with paranormal elements,\" I found this book to be incredibly moving and very, very touching. I would not exactly characterize the story as paranormal but more the tale of a deeply empathetic man who is simply searching for love and acceptance. And please don't be put off by this being the second book in a series. I have not read the first book and I absolutely fell in love with these characters and the plot. This book is a total standalone! \n Nik and Fiona are both lost and simply wishing for a better life. For Nik, he only wants to silence the cacophony of sounds and colors he sees and for Fiona, it is the hope of a new life in Costa Rica. And when they meet, it is pure magic. \n \"But it wasn't what was wrong with me, anymore. It was what was right. The girl exuded a calm that danced along my skin, and when I inhaled, it was like breathing in the scent of something delicious but far away. The thrumming life all around me grew quiet. For the first time, I felt close to peace, and I wanted more.\" \n What begins as a one-night stand with zero expectations for the future turns into a burning hot love and a deep, unbreakable connection. Emma Scott's love scenes are beautiful and SEXY and a joy to read! \n \"Nikolai Alexei,\" she whispered and cupped my cheeks to look at me in the dimness. \"Who are you?\" \n There are very important messages in this book as well as some very gritty and heartbreaking scenes. But ultimately the message is one of hope and acceptance and unconditional love. Once again, I won't soon forget the characters created by Emma Scott. A must-read! \n \"Love and hope,\" she said. \"That's life to me.\" \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)"}

{"text": "Oblivion's forge is one of those novels that had me all confused as to whether it's categorized as fantasy or Sci Fi. \n Make no mistake. My confusion does not at all take away anything from the story, in fact I have a very high regard towards anyone that can create something from nothing which is what fantasy is all about. \n In Oblivion's Forge, Simon Williams has managed just that, to create a chain-full story revolving around the embarking of key characters journeys all of which play off in the world of Aona. The dark fantasy starts with the characters individual adventures that flow into a splendid final as the said individual's world's interlock with majestic brilliance. \n Surprisingly, the separation of reading the story from different perspective doesn't pull ones concentration away from the story at hand. Instead it creates grounds for a masterfully set adventure which is carefully crafted around their individual personas. \n The splendidly put intricate words of Simon salute the resurrection of an ancient force who returns from a void in an effort to restore the old magic within it. The war between the two fractions sets a delightful display as it embarks with no backdrop but flows in such a way that you are fed multiple points of information throughout the story-line without feeling a loss. \n Cunningly set and skilfully displayed. \n Splendid craft."}

{"text": "I am a fan of the Twilight series, because I think it works on a couple of levels and gets people talking about things that are truly important in life -though I also appreciate the snark and criticism, much of which is valid. However, this installment of the series was difficult for me. There is a lot of darkness in this book, a lot of pulling toward death. Jacob is a bright light, and his character is overwhelmingly more positive, but I found this book a difficult read. \n Edward was annoying, and this book features him at his worst. As for dramatic effect, I completely understand his leaving. Yet, it just didn't make sense to me. I mean, we all knew Victoria was still out there, right? And I thought his whole break up and erase all trace was malicious and cruel. In addition, so much of their relationship is borderline destructive/ psycho in this book. Edward goes from borderline stalking to distant. I was infuriated when they are reunited, discussing what has happened, and Edward says, \"But Bella, how could you have believed me when I said I didn't love you, didn't want you?\" What kind of a psycho, manipulative mind game is that? Like it's her fault you left and she took you at your word? WHAT? And then the whole Romeo & Juliet I'm gonna kill myself thing was just plain stupid, Edward. Stupid. The one redeeming thing was that he did acknowledge he made a colossal mistake, but it wasn't enough to redeem the work for me. I wonder if I will go on hating him? \n Bella was annoying too. I know he left her. I know it was horrible. I didn't marry the first man I fell in love with, and when we broke up, it was horrendous. Excruciating. So I get it that Bella was in pain, and much of her story brought that all back for me. This could also be why I had a negative reaction to this book, it just got too personal. But at the same time, you cannot let yourself go insane, girl. This is a bad message for young women. If you lose Mr. Wonderful, it's all over for you unless he comes back or you go rescue him and he decides he does want you after all??!?! I wanted her to pull herself back, to triumph over the grief. Having gone through the situation, I found the Paris chapter incredibly compelling, and I liked the relationship with Jacob, I just wish Bella could have found a way to survive without having to 'hear the voice in her head'. That she would have chosen the way of life, deliberately, before the whole course of events to reunify them came along. And, I honestly thought maybe it was really Edward, seeing her, talking to her, or that somehow the bite mark on her hand created some kind of unanticipated vampire connection. A supernatural cause would have been more satisfying to me than her slow decline into insanity. I also thought it disturbing that her memory of Edward's voice was his anger. His wrath, inflexibility, dominance. It was icky. From a human perspective, this kind of hold a man can have on a woman's life (and I'm not saying there isn't destruction of men by women, but that isn't the context here) CAN be broken and SHOULD be broken. \n Young women out there: Heartbreak CAN be survived and overcome! You CAN make it. And when you do, you may find there is someone even more wonderful, someone who cares for you and builds you up and is perfect for you. Someone like... Jacob. Marry him. And I think she would have, if things had been different, they would have been different.... \n Jacob and the werewolves are handled almost carelessly and were good for a few laughs. I pondered: Is it true that the people/ precepts that are to guard us are less inviting/ attractive/ engaging than the predators/ illusions that destroy us? And my answer was YES. I found the Volturi a bit wooden, it just wasn't working for me, I thought it could have been so much more. Of course, Alice is cool. Relieved to be done. 2 stars."}

It turns out that there is a score card with points for good and evil deeds. Since Meg tried to save a man's life shortly before she died, her score is an even tie. Meg is sent back to earth as a spirit. She goes to see the man who she tried to rob and then save. Lowrie McCall is not glad to see her which is a shame since he is the only one who can see her. He doesn't have long to live. His heart is failing. Lowrie has taken stock of his life and is disappointed by the result. A series of missed opportunities changed the outcome.

{"text": "As I sit here trying to review this book, all that comes to mind is meh?! \n Was the book bad? No. Was the book good? No. It just was... \n I can honestly say I have not read a book with this same plot, so there's that. The writing was alright, choppy at times, but overall it flowed well and had enough descriptions to compliment the story. \n The main character, Jane, was your typical girl with a troubled past that adapts and overcomes. She was chock full of teenaged-angst and had a rather large vocabulary. In the ever increasing sea of female main characters that are vapid and self-serving, it was nice to read about one who strives to better her situation by hard work and dedication, not on the backs of others. Beyond that, I found Jane boring. She was even described as \"Plain Jane.\" I just couldn't relate or feel interested in her plight/story. She just fell flat. Jacob was, well, strange. I liked that he was witty and loyal. As I read the conversations between him and Jane, I kept thinking, \"this guy is bat-shit crazy, but he is kind of sweet!?\" Lucien...total douche and has a completely stupid nickname. I really liked the supporting female characters, especially Mary Violet. Her translations were really funny and about the only thing I found appealing in the entire book. \n All in all, this book was just not my cup of tea, so to speak. The mystery was not so subtlety hinted at so it kept my interest until \"the big reveal.\" After, I just lost interest completely. It was slow to start and boring until the end. Maybe it is just me. Maybe I didn't really like the book because I, personally, couldn't get engaged with the storyline or characters. Other readers might really love and/or relate to a down-and-out girl who leaves her sad, troubled life in order find true happiness through intellectual growth and a non-pimp boyfriend. \n And, wtf was \"the lady of woods\" all about?! I'm still kind of scratching my head over that one...."}
{"text": "I wanted to give this book at least 3 stars for remaining interesting in action (I have not been fond of the new canon novels this year), but the present-tense and the out-of-context use of language dramatically affected the tone and feel of the writing. I do not approve of the slap-dash use of current American colloquial (stylistic dangling participles, incomplete sentences, stated actions instead of developing character and place) like this was a blog or a comic book or screen play and not an immersive novel. \n There are still interesting things in here, like the interludes and some post-Jedi world building teasers. I will be reading the sequels as it is slated to be a trilogy (cringe) but I still don't understand why this novel got past the editing process in its current state? Did they rush everything because of marketing for \"Journey to Stat Wars: The Force Awakens\"? Wendig's will not be a welcome \"fresh voice\" to the canon if there is not more editorial oversight to the mechanics of the writing process going forward. I want to look past the style to enjoy the plot more, but as a trained writer myself I cannot. \n And what's the point in having Wedge Antilles here if he's not given more than 10 pages of \"screen time?\" He's set up as the major character, but then his involvement is as lengthy as an interlude. There are far too many characters and not enough character development to share amongst them. \n Okay, one fun mechanic: about 1/3-1/2 way into the book, there is a slew of scenes that all begin with a character saying, \"we have a problem\" which was kind of cheesy, but still worked to tie everything together and be a plot turning-point for every thread of characters spread about. It helped the pacing and kept me from putting down the book right then."}

{"text": "I absolutely love Game of Thrones. I love the rich characterization and made-up history. I love that Martin keeps surprising me. And he managed to do that yet again, a few times, in book 5. I loved it! \n That being said, I feel like George is spreading himself a bit too thin. I managed to work my mind around book 4 and book 5 being parallel stories, but the fact is, there just might be too many characters to keep track of. Though the story is rich and varied, the overall timeline of the story advances very little in this book. We visit our favourite characters very seldom, making room for ever more new faces and their own baggage. And can we say cliffhangers? I estimate about the last 10 chapters end in serious unresolved problems! \n Perhaps this is just great strategy on George R. R. Martin's part. After all, I'm joining my voice with the masses of anxious fans asking \"When?\" Hurry up, please, Mr. Martin! We can't wait for book 6."}

{"text": "I read the first three of this series all in a row and am now impatiently waiting for the fourth one to come out. Unfortunately, authors can't possibly write as fast as I can read! But that little problem shouldn't stop anyone who enjoys light paranormal mysteries from picking up the first three and diving in. The writing is solid, the heroine is likeable although a bit stubborn in her disbelief of voodoo with an abrupt turnaound nntowards the end in Book 1-Who Do VooDoo? But overall this is a great new series with stories you'll enjoy and characters you'll look forward to visiting as each new book comes out."}
{"text": "Started good, but I must have lost interest, I will definitely pick this one up again."}
{"text": "Charlaine Harris just keeps ramping up the suspense and the violence in this series of Sookie Stackhouse books. The poor heroine survives one trial and tribulation after another - often with the help of her not completely human friends and lovers. In this newest installment, someone is hunting shape-shifters and the supernatural community suspects that Sookie's brother could be the shooter. Since he has recently been infected, Jason is more likely to be a target himself. This book is considerably less sexy than previous installments. However, there are now a couple more creatures who are intrigued by Sookie so perhaps the stage is being set for future encounters. Even without sex, a Sookie Stackhouse book is hard to put down. Charlaine Harris sure does create addictive page-turners. Once again, the story builds upon previous books. Don't start reading in the middle of the story. Begin with Dead Until Dark and go from there."}
{"text": "Something special here. \n 3.5 Stars. At first, I had a difficult time feeling any depth for Kailin's character. I am glad that the first novella gave me so much Rowan that I needed to continue on and find more to the story than what is on the surface. Finally, I stuck with it and found deceit, a crumbling society that is losing balance, and the pull that one has to learn to read inside themselves. There are crazy twists and, best of all, Rowan kisses that left me breathless."}
{"text": "Just as great as the first \n So I read this book in like an hour more or less and that should tell you how amazing this book is. It's about Tessa trying to save Meredith but even throughout all that Tessa and Dastien's bond gets stronger they make the cutest couple and Donovan and Meredith are a close second. I'm definitely buying the third I can't wait to see what's in store for the Full Moon Ceremony and the Tribunal. I absolutely love this series!! :)"}
{"text": "It's not what I usually read, but now I understand why Neil Gaiman is so highly rated! An enjoyable and well-paced book."}
{"text": "Meh."}
{"text": "This is the kind of book to take you back to your young adult or teen years, and it is perhaps written with that population in mind. It's is reminiscent of Harry Potter and hunger games and divergent, all at once. While there are many predictable plot points, the central idea as revealed by Astria's character is very interesting. It definitely is a fast read, you want to know what's happening next. There were some predictable parts but that could mostly be because I'm older than the population this was aimed for."}
{"text": "**I was given a copy by the author for an honest review** \n 3.5 Stars \n Not only is Lucinda (Lu) hiding a secret of her own but she's also torn between two men - fire department chief Josh Reynolds and arson inspector Byron Morgan. Both men are attractive and Lu has in the beginning a difficult time figuring out who and what she wants.Who will she choose- handsome but edgy Josh or charismatic and attentive Byron ? To make her life a little more complicated Lu accidently causes few more fires and things start to turn against her, so Lu's secret is about to be exposed. Will she able to keep her secret safe or will Reynolds and Morgan discover what Lu is hiding all this time. As if this wasn't enough, Lu get's blackmailed by her best friends daughter, Kaitlynn. \n I liked the story and it was interesting to read for who Lu will decide and if her secret gets exposed. I'm a big fan of paranormal stories and that's why I agreed to review Nora's book. I wished the story would have gotten deeper into Lu's ability and given more background knowledge about the How come of her ability and just in general more details. I wasn't as hooked as I hoped I would be. Overall it was a good story and I haven't yet read anything similiar to it. However the story needs more details because during reading many question came to my mind and I came to the conclusion the story needed a bit more development to hook me. For me it seemed more like a romance/criminal read than paranormal. I prefer when genres are balanced in a story, it makes it more interesting. \n It is a good read and I would recommend it as a light read anytime. You will like the steamy scenes for sure -I did- and the story has a twist at the end which I found very surprsing (didn't see that coming!!). You'll find yourself, while reading, playing detective cause you too want to help handsome Morgan to solve his case. \n For more reviews visit our blog: http://hookmeupbookblog.blogspot.com.au/"}

{"text": "Someone hit me upside the head. I almost didn't buy this because the story looked like the same old witch meets vampire meets werewolf meets shapeshifter teen romance thing, blah blah blah. But this book rocked! \n First off, it sucked you right in (no pun intended). The main character was funny and likable without being too perfect. The plot kept moving; Rachel Hawkins executed plot twists like a pro; and the pacing was awesome! I loved this book and can't wait to get my hands on the sequel."}

{"text": "3.5 Stars for this contemporary dragon shifter fated-mates M/M romance. \n Shae is a forty-ish artist with a deep and abiding love for all things dragon. He has tons of tattoos featuring the slinky, sexy beasts, and he builds large dragon statues for sale. One afternoon, the fire crew is called out by one of his nosy neighbors. Jake is the head fireman sent to assess Shae's permits, and to make sure he's safe with his blowtorch. \n There's an immediate spark, and Jake, a centuries old dragon shifter, makes it a point to return for a more personal inspection. Learning that Shae has Jake's personal seal and dragon-tongue name inked into his skin disrupts the sexytimes. Momentarily. Once Jake checks with the fae tattoo artist and learns that Shae is his fated Mate? These two get it on like...all the freaking time. \n Roughly 85% of the book is Jake giving it to Shae. Copiously, and with some BDSM elements (spanking, bondage, orgasm denial, plugging) because Shae is an apologetic pain slut. As their bond solidifies, Shae learns that he needs to eat more, so food prep and eating takes up about 10% of the book. The other five percent is Shae flying on Jake's back, meeting three of Jake's four also-gay dragon brothers, and Shae feeling insecure about his looks/age/kinks and why Jake seemingly trapped him into a fate bond. \n The love seemed to happen very quick, but that's nearly acceptable in fated mates stories. I just wished we'd learned a bit more about Shae's history, why he was so isolated, and how Jake's family came into being. The 'rents deets are seriously sketchy. \n So much sexytimes--I could have done with less, and liked the book just as well. I'd have liked it better, I think, if there had been a bit more emotions, or conflict, in it. Lots of dominance, but the heart didn't seem to equal out. And, more flying. I loved the flying bits. \n That said, the book was an easy read, and I'm eager to spend more time with this dragon-shifter series. I received a review copy via NetGalley."}
{"text": "This book is unlike anything I have ever read before. There were so many times while reading it that I found myself just completely unable to get over how unique and cool this world is. It's also my new favorite fairy tale retelling of all time. A lot of retellings are very loosely based, but I loved how many aspects of the original Cinderella there were in this book and how they all came together in new and original ways. I loved Cinder's character so much and even though I could kind of see some of the plot twists coming I still really enjoyed reading them. That ending though. I desperately need book two more than anything but I have no money to buy it right now so until I can get my hands on it I'll just be dangling off this cliff . . ."}
{"text": "After many rave reviews of The Dark and Hollow Places (the third book in this series), I decided to finally pick up my copy of The Forest of Hands and Teeth and give it a try. I had purchased it months ago at Walmart with the intent to read, so this just gave me a good opportunity. \n I purposely did not know much about the book before starting. I never read the synopsis and did not read reviews. \n I was surprised at the overall feel of the book after I had finished and reflected. Everyone constantly says it's \"Not a zombie book,\" and I can wholeheartedly agree with that now - at the end it felt much more akin to Susan Beth Pfeffer's Life As We Knew It or Meg Rosoff's How I Live Now - survival in spite of zombies. \n The beginning half of the book is quite different from the last half, as the setting drastically changes partway through due to circumstances the characters experience. I enjoyed the second half more than the first, but this could also be because by the second half you are much more invested in the characters. \n My biggest gripe with The Forest of Hands and Teeth is that often days or weeks would go by with no mention, and I prefer to have a continuous story. Though I suppose having a few weeks of living with no extraordinary events is realistic - it just feels less likely to me in a dystopian setting. \n I'm interested to see how the second and third books go. I've had readers tell me they enjoyed the second (Dead Tossed Waves) many more times than the first, with the third (Dark and Hollow Places) being a perfect ending to the trilogy - this is very exciting to me because I quite enjoyed The Forest of Hands and Teeth as it was. \n Very recommended to Susan Beth Pfeffer fans - or, if you've read The Forest of Hands and Teeth, I recommend you try the Pfeffer books. Survival based and you get that eerie, frantic feeling with both. Good start to the series!"}
{"text": "I saved me this book forever but I couldn't wait any longer - I'm like an addict LOL \n This book...my where do I start...ok, well it just swept me off my feet. I was interesting and to the same time sad to read from Dex's POV how he lived thru his heartbreak. Reading his thoughts, his actions were sad and I felt SO SO sorry for him. \n He felt even worse than Perry and his friends did a great job helping him back on his feet. I loved Dean's and Rebeccas's support a lot; it made Dex open up more which I think is good for him. \n As always Karina did a brilliant job writing another book...so far I liked every book from the EIT series and her Artists Trilogy- I can't wait of book 7 \"Come Alive\". \n People, if you haven't read her books yet, ur missing out on something great- so hurry up and add the book on ur TBR or Amazon list ;) U won't regret it!!!"}
{"text": "What an awesome book this was. It was creative and complex and thought provoking and moving. Through the eyes of Harry August, a man who is reborn upon death over and over again, this book surveys many of the most pivotal events of the twentieth century and does so in a fresh, compelling way while also asking heady philosophical questions about the meaning of life, the nature of time itself, and the possibility and desirability of altering history. \n While a lot of the material here is quite heavy, North also employed wry humor expertly. Much of her writing is darkly witty. Harry is a great character who has a fascinating array of reactions to his continuous reincarnations. Harry frequently skips around in his first person narration of his lives which could have been a real problem in the hands of a less skilled author but North never makes the development of the plot or the characters feel choppy. All the digressions about his lives, all his offhand observations are just as interesting and worthwhile as the main plot. And Harry's extreme longevity allows him the opportunity to build long, complicated, fascinating relationships with a great roster of supporting characters. \n This book is so ambitious, so bursting at the seams with cool concepts and characters and plot twists, that it was an absolute joy to read from beginning to end."}
{"text": "I first read the Quarters Books when I was in high school and I've re-read them quite a few times since, but these short stories were new to me so I was very excited to return to this world. Huff did not disappoint with these short stories. I found them entertaining and brought back a sense of nostalgia but without compromising or diminishing my memories of the originals, which sometimes happens when you revisit something you loved so long ago. I'm sure they could stand on their own, but honestly, I wouldn't want them too because I think they have more depth within the context of the originals. \n Vree is my favorite character from the original books, so I was very pleased to read the two shorts featuring her and appreciated the little peek at her post-HEA life in the third story. I also really enjoyed Evicka's story as she had a minor appearance in the original series, but even so many years later, I remembered exactly who she was and it was nice to see her character develop in this short. \n Two thumbs up - I'm sure I'll read them again but would do so within the chronology of the original books the next time I decide to re-read those. :)"}

{"text": "Oh god I am so divided on this book/script. I loved Scorpius and Draco, they made the entire piece tolerable. I disliked Ron and Harry a lot. Some moments of the book/script were strong and very exciting but Harry's parenting was cringeworthy and unbelievable and the ending was weak. \n I also felt as if they were building up to Scorpius being gay, and when that didn't end up happening it felt sorta empty? Still four stars because I managed to finish it in less that 24 hours and that happens rarely these days. \n So enjoyable but the weakest of the eight."}
{"text": "Let me tell you about this somofabitch \n There is some major heavy world building going on here \n and its going to suck you in from chapter one. \n The heroine a worthless cripple with no money to her name but a few spare kindness from her master. Bathes a couple times a year. Bread in the morning and gruel for dinner. Everyone and I mean everyone hates and are disgusted by her. By being what? A cripple. Simply because it looks bad luck to have anything to do with her. There is only one thing that keeps her from slaving away and selling her backside. Only one thing to keep her from ruin. Her potential as a dragoneye. And the odds are definitely not in her favor. \n So you could tell the book will give you mind-thrilling events action-packed with suspense and curiosity because when I tell you you thought that it was going that way it's not. \n You're not gonna want to put the book down. Well... except to gather your thoughts around the unsuspected plot twists. \n Things that I actually like: \n I love how she is strong and enduring. The people around her are clearly repulsed by her condition but she seem unperturbed wearing a mask of neutrality. \n She is a survivalist. She thinks ahead and she thinks fast. Knowing the enemy to know what to avoid and what to say to what? Survive. \n I felt automatic sympathy with her. Everyone was being harsh, deceitful and unforgiving. And all I wanted was to hug her and make all the bad things go away. Everyone else was like: \n In some instances, I found myself shouting or howling with rage moved by the events and at the same time rooting for her to have strength. \n Seriously, the duck-size egg on the emperors throat between his collarbones. Yeah, I can take that. But getting sensual pleasure just by rubbing it like \n I KEPT WAITING FOR THE GOOD THINGS TO HAPPEN. I MEAN YES. YOU HAVE SUCCEEDED TWISTING MY HEART IN ALL WAYS POSSIBLE OVER AND OVER AGAIN BUT IS IT REALLY THAT HARD TO WANT A SIMPLE GOOD THING FOR HER. Like to loosen up or where she truly smiles and her worries and insecurities goes away but nooooooooooooooooooooooooo \n Apart from this being a tragedy, heroism and self-doubts. It has been a great ride. It really is well-written. Never dull never bore. The world description are so well-made it's almost you are sucked in the place itself. A very rare occurrence."}
{"text": "I will admit, I often judge a book by its cover. I am a very visual person - in fact, I have a college degree in Visual Design - so I tend to make some decisions about a book based on the graphics and colors used for the cover. \n I don't always let this affect my opinion of a book, though. The Secret Society of the Pink Crystal Ball is a very good example of this. I was interested in reading it because it seemed like a light, fun read - and it actually turned out to be a little more deep than that, which means it was even better than I expected! \n This doesn't always happens when I judge a cover, of course, but it does happen. \n The Secret Society of the Pink Crystal Ball (SSotPCB) reminded me a lot of The Karma Club by Jessica Brody, actually. They both have to do with wishes/getting what you want, and realizing the effect this has on those around you. \n There were quite a few characters in SSotPCB that had very distinct personalities, which doesn't always happen in a book with a more 'fun' topic. And as I said before, the plot pleasantly surprised me with a little more depth and learning from the characters involved. \n I think that SSotPCB is a great read for a younger reader looking for more substance but hasn't stepped out of the middle grade zone much. Or for a reluctant girl reader (the pink on the cover certainly doesn't hurt). It is very well written, and I believe it is part of a series (at least that's the feeling I got), so I am looking forward to reading more adventures with these girls and their secret society!"}
{"text": "See full review for Splintered at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n We all know the tale of Alice in Wonderland with white rabbits, mad hatters, tea parties and a head-seeking queen. But in Splintered everything we know about Wonderland is proven false. Alice still went this mysterious land, but when she came back she told her tale to Lewis Carroll and everyone in her bloodline has been considered crazy ever since. Alyssa is part of her bloodline and her mother has already succumbed to the illness and is locked up inside the local asylum. She talks to bugs and tried to cut up her own daughter a few years ago. Alyssa barely remembers her childhood, but she knows that her family's curse seems to be coming for her next. She can already hear the bugs talk to her - hence why she uses their dead forms in her artwork - and now she is seeing people in mirrors and voices in her head. \n Thank goodness for her friend Jeb who is the only person to keep her grounded. He's always there for her and looks after her, and that's what he thinks he's doing when he tells her father that she shouldn't be allowed to go to London next year. It isn't safe for her there. Alyssa is still mad at him and she believes their friendship has become frayed because of it (and the fact that he's dating a girl who she can't stand). Hence her bad mood when she goes to visit her mother the night of the prom. Her mother is still acting crazy like usual, however today is different when she starts talking about a key, a pair of gloves, a fan, and a mysterious him. Trying to get the answers out of her mother, she watches in horror as her mother's braid almost chokes the life out of her. Her father and some nurses stop the event from happening and her father makes the decision that something more extreme needs to be done to stop these delusions. But Alyssa doesn't think they are and tries to figure out what her mother meant. Thinking she needs to go to London to find the answers, she makes plans. But her friend calls in Jeb who tries to stop her, instead he follows her into the rabbit hole. \n They end up in Wonderland, but not the one they know from the stories. This is Wonderland post Alice, and Alyssa is apparently the descendant who will fix all the wrongs and right the balance. But Jeb feels that something else is going on and Alyssa isn't sure she can do what she needs to do to break the curse on her family."}

I remembered adding this book to my TBR pile months ago and I was excited for it back then. When I picked it up a few days ago, I was trying to remember what exactly had me so excited. Then I read the summary and remembered. Oh, right, Russia. Magic. Tsars. Love triangles. So I dived in with a gusto. I was not disappointed."}
{"text": "A fun concept but really poorly executed. For one thing, the author would establish rules for how the world's would interact and then break those rules. (ex. fairy tale characters knowledge is limited by things that are in the book; so they don't know about things like showers, because there are no showers in the fairy tale. However, at one point one of them talks about ameobas. There are no ameobas in fairy tales.) Also, both the writing and character personalities were more on par with a juvie novel than YA."}
{"text": "See full review for Welcome to Shadowhunter Academy at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... \n This is a small story of what happened after the events of City of Heavenly Fire. Simon doesn't have all his memories back, but he has glimpses. He knows that if he wants to be the badass vampire from before - just less undead - then he's going to have to train. Jace - who now is really close to the guy, who knew? - offered to train him along with Clary, but Simon refused. If he's going to do this, he needs to do this away from the people that he formerly knew. So he goes to the newly reopened Shadowhunter Academy which is on the outskirts of Idris. And by newly reopened I mean, the building is still kind of rundown - the indoor plumbing doesn't even work and we won't get into the food that the dean decides to serve. \n But even here, the in-training Shadowhunters know who Simon Lewis is. He's a legend. He's the badass who helped the Shadowhunters win the last war. So that automatically makes him a member of the elite Shadowhunters, even though he's just a mundane."}
{"text": "Audio book read by Phil Gigante \n The cases don't solve themselves so Dan 'Shamble' is back with a whole new set of cases to solve in the unnatural quarter. Many familiar faces make appearances as in previous novels but this can be read on it's own with no prior knowledge of the series. If you can't tell from the cover and premise, this is a supernatural humor novel with a diverse cast of supernatural creatures chock full of puns that could even make your crazy uncle groan. If that sounds like something fun to you or you've enjoyed previous novels in this series - you will like this novel. If that doesn't sound great to you or you're on the fence....you'll probably hate this book because it doesn't take itself seriously at all. \n You can tell Kevin J. Anderson probably had fun writing this novel. He puts a lot of tongue-in-cheek commentary about book writing, publishing, and the nature of best sellers in here (more than previous novels). He goes to great lengths to set up a scene for things happening just to slip a one liner in there (my favorite one being, \"familiarity breeds contempt\" because Thunder Dick's familiar cat Maurice hates his guts) . Like I said, many will make you groan but I have to admit that several actually did make me laugh. So one of the cases Shamble is working on is that someone's voice was stolen. He regains control of his voice but it isn't returned to his body yet so he starts yelling out some really good stuff from the mouth of the guy who still has it. \"I like to wear ladies' underwear\" \"I pick my nose...and EAT IT!\" It goes on for a while but didn't get old. \n As for the audio side of things, Phil Gigante continues to shine in this series. The cartoony nature of the characters lets him use a wide range of voices. He really handles the comedic nature of the novel well and puts a good amount of inflection in his tone."}

Which brings unwanted attention her way. \n That when strange things start to happen when two girls try to corner her in the bathroom. \n So she isn't as normal as she thought and was is this life that's set before her, and Garrett too? \n I would definitely recommend this book to everyone, you won't be disappointed.g"}
{"text": "First off, I received this book from a goodreads giveaway maybe 1 or 2 years ago? So thanks to the publishers! (Extra thanks because it was the super cool black version) \n On to my review. \n Wow. I was pleasantly surprised by this book -- I couldn't put it down. In fact, I finished this book in a day! \n This is a YA book but it was so incredibly dark at times that I wondered if it was actually an adult book. That darkness definitely worked for this book and pushed the book into \"amazing\" territory. The writing was great too, the shorter sentences really worked to fit the tone and the mood. There are some pretty graphic scenes that made me a bit queasy and uncomfortable so that tells you how great the writing is. \n I do feel like the worldbuilding could use more work and padding because the white and black witch thing could use more work and expansion, but I also understand that the way the book is written is designed for us to go through Nathan's journey with him, only knowing what he knows, and he's pretty ignorant. Still, I think it would just bring the book up another notch. \n I was excited to read this book because I only heard good things about it and I'm happy to say the reviews and the hype were right! This was an incredibly strong debut novel and I can't wait to read the second book!"}
{"text": "John Charming works at a bar in middle-of-nowhere Virginia because he's a werewolf (well, part werewolf) on the run from the Knight's Templar. The Knights are sworn to uphold the Pax Arcana and protect the monsters of the world from human discovery. (The world building of the Pax Arcana feels a bit familiar...hmm...) If this book would've been more about the Pax Arcana and awesome vampire hunts, it would've been awesome. Instead, it's about John's stupid love life, which is terrible and boring. Sig, a Valkyrie, walks into John's bar to hunt a vampire, and the will they/won't they starts almost immediately. It's like this author was told urban fantasy was all about the angsty relationships and forgot that those only work if they're a side-story or the 'B plot', and John's relationship with Sig felt like the 'A plot' of this story. \n I'm a bit disappointed John isn't a real werewolf. Disreputable bartender? Check. Renegade Knights Templar? Also check. Werewolf? That's a stretch. Don't go into this expecting a shifter heavy book. \n Didn't care as much for the 'old' myth and modern technology blending. It felt forced instead of creative; it was more like the author wanting you to know how smart he was verses John authentically being presented as intelligent. The book was heavily self-referential and wanted to appear smart, but there were some stupid things it did to undermine the credibility of the story. When a story gets too referential--to the point where it's mocking its own plot--it can mean there are serious problems in the story. Instead of being meta, it highlighted the things that already bothered me about this story. \n Not thrilled with Sig. There's way too much time devoted early in the book to how much she likes John and vice versa. I'm not feeling it. I mean, seriously, we could be getting a bloody vampire show down, and John and Cahill, the cop, are having these boring conversations about Sig and her love life. \"I've known Sig for twenty-four hours...\" is about right. Cahill is a creep, which makes John and Cahill's scene about 100x worse and sufficiently awkward. This is only the first of many, endless awkward scenes between John and just about everyone in this story. \n John's personality: it will make or break this book. It's the biggest positive, to me, but not as humorous as some might find it. John points out how half-assed his man-pain is, and it's a meta instance of the character defending a weakness in the narrative. Meta is great when it's actually humorous, but John's tragic past never quite clicked with me. There's all this teasing about the Knights, but he doesn't actually fight them. They never directly come after him. That's a shame because the Knights and the other elements of the world-building were much better than John and Sig's story, which is the center piece of this novel. The vampire hive house was gory and fantastic. The 'smart vampire', Anne Marie, is the real mystery to this story. The twist ending didn't work here and sunk what hope for the story I had. I spent this entire story hoping it would be awesome, but nope! The entire story is really about John's love life, even up to the bitter freaking end. \n Molly and Choo are too good for this story. So is Parth. Parth is also the best. This story is much better when it focuses on its action piece set-points. Some of John's fighting feels like the fantasy equivalent of Bullet Time, but those scenes are still gripping. Anything is better than the soggy, white-bread relationship between Sig and John. \n Maybe I'll have to go into a full rant about special reasoning and map reading in fantasy soon, but another instance showed up here. I mean, have people used topo maps in the woods before? Here's the full quote: \n \"Last night I visualized a map of the area I was in like a man. And I knew exactly where I was on that map. Men can't do that without landmarks. Wolves can't do that. But I could.\" \n First, you would've had landmarks. I get the point is that wolf-senses are heightened and that enables a better understanding of where one is, but this is illogical. The speed at which the information was processed is the key, I think, to this scene. But you, a normal human, do this type of special awareness all the time when you go 'off trail.' Yes, the key is landmarks, but there are lots of little tricks to knowing if you're lost and how lost you are. Here's an example: I hiked a 'trail' (I say this lightly) through a canyon system. It was mostly washed out, so there was a fair amount of knowing when to leave the wash, what side branch to take, and where we would get 'spit out' if we followed the route correctly. There were certain sets of landmarks we used to help guide our progress. This took TIME, but in and of itself, this isn't some kind of super power. Processing this type of information at speed is what would be difficult. \n I wanted to like this book. I actively hate read this book to give it a chance as if every new plot twist would refocus the book on its more interesting elements. That never happens. This book kept getting worse and finding new, creative ways to let me down. Every time something interesting happens, the focus shifts to John and his whiny past or John and Sig's boring relationship."}

The two men work to solve the murder mystery, while Matt's job is on the line and someone is trying to kill them. \n A bit of mystery, a bit of drama, a bit of humour, a bit of romance, a bit of sex....... \n I even found the ghost quite believable up until the last scenes where Abby (the ghost) starts as a glowing ball and hovers in front of the bad guy before taking another form and traumatising him .

It wasn't bad just that he looked a bit different and I got to the end where there's an author note saying that the author is continually trying to approve upon Sebastian so it made sense that he didn't quite look the same. I definitely enjoyed the art in this book."}

{"text": "I didn't go into this book with high hopes. I am trying to branch out into more varieties of books, so I thought to try this historical-style fantasy. Wow. I was not expecting the excellence I found. The main character was so funny and clever and real while the villain leaned toward a caricature but never actually made it there. The cast of characters interacted well and the hero was weak at times and needed help which kept him from being a cliche. I had a hard time reading parts of the book set in the dungeon, but it passed somewhat quickly. I was happy with the ending and looking at the descriptions of the next two books in the trilogy made me want to stop there for now. I'd rather leave the company as they are and think happy thoughts than plunge them into war. Maybe later I'll come back to them, but I've read from others that the first works well as a stand-alone and I am content to leave it at that."}
{"text": "Alexa/ Wraith has seen the face of her enemy, and knows it is....herself. \n All this time she has been kept in the dark about Gehenna's goals, but they became crystal clear in this episode: eternity. Moloch and Seth and the others have a vision that includes high potentials having extraordinarily long lives--and who are the highest of potentials? The ones who have the ability to take life energy: debt collectors. \n Alexa/Wraith is offered keys to the executive washroom--leadership capability within the organization--but can she stomach the horror of doing what Gehenna demands, knowing it's will mean the lives of millions hang in the balance. \n What was that, Lord Acton? \"Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men?\" \n Yeah. Guess all that power makes quite the temptation. Thing is, can Alexa/Wraith even stop the tidal wave Gehenna has unleashed? Or, will it batter her against the rocks? \n As always, the pace is perfect. I felt as whipsawed about as Alexa did--caught in a world she knew existed but didn't understand. The horror she witnesses, and the callous disregard the debt collectors of Gehenna hold for the mere humans, is staggering on both sides of the page. I'm hooked! \n I received a copy from the author in exchange for an honest review."}
{"text": "It is my belief that there are two types of readers in the world; those that sit down and just read the words of a book and those that live the book. Those that are classified in the second category live, breathe, and become all consumed with the characters, plots, and events of a book. Sometimes this happens with one book, sometimes it happens with every book that they read, but it happens. \n If you have ever had an experience like the above mentioned situation then Libriomancer is a book for you. Jim C. Hines has created a magic system that exists in the modern world that I only wish really existed and I'm sure that other book lovers wished existed too. \n Libriomancer revolves around the idea that there is a secret group of sorcerers, known as Libriomancers. These people have the ability to open a book, reach into it, and take out anything was created in that book. This even includes people, but they would of course be copies of the individual not the actual individual. \n Of course, there are limitations like the item has to fit through the size of the book and only items that were written into books that were widely distributed could be materialized. And with all magic systems, there are problems and consequences such as hearing voices, the book may drag you too far into it, and the books get charred or burned look if used too many times. \n I found this entire magical system extremely captivating and intriguing. Just the simple thought that the books that are sitting on my shelf could essentially be used as weapons or that I could grab a copy of Harry Potter and pull out a wand to try and use it really fascinated me. \n Hine's spent a lot of time developing this magic system and put a lot of thought into it. There would be occasional times throughout the book that I would wonder about a certain problem or loophole I discovered, only to find that that same exact question is addressed later on. \n For example, I was struggling with the idea that if people could do anything with books (pull people out, use items, etc.) what would happen if something that was extremely powerful or influential was used, say The Bible. Hine addresses this exact question by having a group of Libriomancers who read all books and determine if they are a risk. If they are the book has a magical lock placed on it and people can read it, but not use it for magical purpose. \n That isn't all that kept me reading this book. Jim C. Hine has a way of writing that just pulls you into the book. His writing is smooth, yet filled with humor that doesn't appear forced or awkward. The humor also does not appear at inappropriate times. If a huge fight scene is going on, Hines isn't going to have his characters rattling off one-liners in the hopes to get you laugh. You'll be sitting there in the midst of a battle or fight. Hines even intertwines several literary references to popular books and authors into the novel without making it feel forced or awkward. \n Fans of Hine's Jig the Goblin series will like the little surprise that Hine's has weaved into the novel. Jig the Goblin is one of my favorite fantasy books and I loved the way Hine's tipped his hat to that series. \n The pace of the novel is just right. It takes time to fully explain everything, including history of the Libriomancers and the magic system, without bogging the book down with lengthy explanations. \n Libriomancer is an urban fantasy. Unfortunately, I believe too many people will read magic, vampires, supernatural, and chalk this series up as just another one of 'those flashy urban fantasy books'. Let me tell you, it is far from it. Yes, it has the same plot elements, but it really is a unique take on the urban fantasy. \n Overall, I loved this book. I think Hine's has some Libriomancer magic going on because this book just pulled me in and kept me reading. If you are a fan of urban fantasy or liked Hine's other series, you will definitely enjoy this novel. Grab a copy and see for yourself, who knows there just might be a little Libriomancer inside you that is waiting to come out."}
{"text": "When it comes to writing - and publishing - there is a desire to stick with what works. Authors and publishers alike are often afraid to step too far out of the literary world's comfort zone in a fear that something won't work. This leads to a slew of novels that are good, but relatively lacking in originality. So, imagine my surprise when I encountered the children's novel, Secrets of the Dragon Tomb, which definitely doesn't conform to the norm. \n Secrets of the Dragon Tomb is a children's novel that mixes so much into a small novel. It has sci-fi elements, steampunk, English history, a little romance, adventure, and a touch of humor. This might seem like a hodgepodge of elements that when combined wouldn't work out, but Secrets of the Dragon Tomb makes it work. \n Readers are taken back in time to 1816, but it isn't like anything you would expect. In this alternative world, Britain has successfully colonized Mars. Travel to and from, and even around, Mars is made possible by dragon pathways. Everything from the way people talk and act to the style of the homes and even the society hierarchy is similar to what would happen in 1816 Britain; the only difference is that people live on Mars. Living on Mars has its challenges, there are unique creatures that may or may not be friendly, native Martians, dinosaurs, and lots of undiscovered areas that could hold untold riches. \n In this first novel of the series, we are introduced to Edward, a young 12-year old boy, who lives on British Mars. Edward longs to have exciting adventures that are similar to what he reads about in the books he loves, but he hasn't had the opportunity to experience these types of adventures. Edward's adventure begins when his father's steampunk-style invention known as the water abacus attracts the attention of some bad guys, the family goes missing, and somehow this all seems linked to the rumor that there is an undiscovered dragon tomb somewhere on Mars. \n I absolutely loved Secrets of the Dragon Tomb, more than I thought I would like it. I was unsure how all the elements of sci-fi, space, steampunk, adventure, and history would mix together, but it was extremely well-done. \n The first thing that jumps out at you Secrets of the Dragon Tomb is the world building. It is done in a way that makes it easily to understand what is going on. It isn't 'dumbed down' for children, but it is done in a way that makes it easy for younger readers to get an understanding of the historical and unique aspects. Even though it is geared towards the younger reader, older readers will be able to enjoy the world building as it doesn't feel as if it is solely geared to the youngest reader. In fact, I think older readers will be able to appreciate how much work went into creating such a detailed world. \n The characters in Secrets of the Dragon Tomb didn't really grab my attention at first. Most of my focus was on the world building and action, but slowly the characters started to grow on me. By the end of the book, I had grown super attached to them and was ready for the next adventure. \n I will say at times the humor isn't laugh out loud funny. It is more light hearted and will certainly put a smile on your face. Many times the definition of humor in children's books is farting, burping, and other juvenile elements. That isn't the case with Secrets of the Dragon Tomb. The humor is age appropriate for children, but it will still appeal to adults, too. \n Overall, I loved Secrets of the Dragon Tomb. I wasn't 100% certain what I would get when I started reading it, but it was amazingly well done. I was surprised to see how well the historical, sci-fi, steampunk, adventure, dinosaur elements blended together. It was also refreshing to see an author willing to take a risk with his novel and have it work out. \n I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for something different, but who doesn't want to spend a lot of time reading a doorstopper novel. It is also great for children who are tired of seeing the same old, same old or for those who aren't committed to reading traditional fantasy novels. The adventure, mystery, and fast pace of this novel is enough to capture the attention of readers young and old."}
{"text": "This retelling of \"East of the Sun, West of the Moon\" alternates point of view, chapter by chapter. There are five narrators--Father, Rose, Neddy (Rose's brother), the Troll Queen, and the White Bear. Rose is the heroine, the youngest of a large family, struggling with poverty. To save the family Rose goes off with the White Bear, who promises the family riches if Rose will come with him. \n Pattou draws extensively from Nordic mythology as well as the original fairy tale and bits of Greek mythology. She's done her research in any number of fields, but use of detail in East is deft and masterful. The details of such work as map making and sailing ships among the icebergs come to life as she describes them. \n East is a rich tapestry of a novel, but it doesn't quite sparkle for me. Each of Pattou's characters has a fleshed-out personality, even the ones she doesn't like. The most lovingly drawn character is of the Inuit shaman who helps Rose travel to the North-most point of the globe. The plot lopes along with an even pace but it never stalls. The resolution is predictable but still satisfying. And while I recommend you read this book if you're a fan of fairy tale retellings or historical YA, it's not one I urge you to rush rush out to acquire."}

I'm hoping that the next book will be about finding a tenth and resolving the power stuggles within te Cadre at last."}
{"text": "All too often when we see the worlds 'fairy tale retelling' it is simply an author taking the same old story - say Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty - and tweaking it just a little bit. Essentially, these authors are adding a tiny twist to make it their own, but the story is the same. \n Spelled by Betsy Schow is a fairy tale retelling that breaks that trend. But whether or not that is a good thing will depend on what type of reader you are and what styles of writing you enjoy. \n Before I even begin to analyze Spelled, I want to note that this is not a book that is for everyone. Spelled is like a YA version of Ever After High. It has cute little nicknames for things that represent the fairy tale world's version of things, such as a band that is very similar to One Direction or a cellphone that looks and acts just like an iPhone. \n In addition to the cute little nicknames, the characters also constantly curse, but they do so in fairy tale style. For example, the characters will constantly say \"Well pix me\" or \"Mother of Grimm\". These sayings are cute the first few times they are done, but they are overdone. The overuse of these cute phrases/cursing may be just enough to turn off most readers. \n If the fairy tale cursing and cutesy nicknames didn't turn you away from the novel, there is the writing style. Spelled is written in a sassy, extremely causal style that includes a lot of cliches, side comments, and attitude. Readers expecting a straightforward, no-nonsense novel probably won't make it through the first few chapters. \n That being said, if you can make it through the sass, the nicknames, and the fairy tale cussing, there is an interesting novel awaiting you. Betsy Schow has taken a little bit of everything from all the Wizard of Oz novels and sort of thrown them together to form a hodgepodge of a story. Longtime fans of Wizard of Oz will certainly see the similarities between some characters and their original counterparts, but for the most part Spelled is its own novel in both character development and plot elements. Think of Wizard of Oz and other fairy tales as more of a guidebook for the story. \n I will admit, I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this mishmash of characters and stories. I appreciate what Schow was trying to achieve and I think it is absolutely wonderful that she went outside of the box, but I don't feel there was enough here to judge. Here's the problem, I found the first half of the book a bit annoying and very, very slow. Just when I went to set it down, it picked up and I really enjoyed the last half of the book. The enjoyment could be because the best character - Hydra - was introduced and she really made the novel. \n I feel as if Schow started to find her footing and pacing in the last half of the novel. This redeemed Spelled for me and makes me actually consider reading the second novel. Unfortunately, it might be too little, too late. Most readers are either going to have abandoned the novel before it got good. This is unfortunate as it started to turn into a halfway decent novel. \n Overall, I really feel Spelled is a book you have to try for yourself. Either you are going to like it or you aren't. There really isn't going to be an in between. I think those going into the novel thinking it is a 100% retelling of the Wizard of Oz will be disappointed, but those that know it isn't like that may be able to have the open minded thinking that could make this an enjoyable book."}
{"text": "This book was everything I hoped it would be. \n I kind of switched back and forth between the kindle version and the audio version at first, but the narrator just blew me way. So I stuck with that. If you have the chance, I seriously recommend it. The narration was brilliantly delivered. \n In the world of Arth, being a hero is a job like any other. There's a hero's guild and everything. If you do your job, you're paid in loot. Heroing is what drives Arth's economy. Magic is rampant and there are always foes to slay. Gorm is a berserker dwarf who, after a quest gone terribly wrong, is left disgraced and without a hero's license. He and six others, ranging from mages to elves, are thrown together (not necessary by choice) to complete a quest that would redeem them in one way or another. As their quest goes on, they realize not everything is at it seems and they have to decide whose side they are really on. \n I think the comparisons to Discworld are apt and well deserved. And I don't say that lightly. I love Terry Pratchett. This book was laugh out loud funny, incredibly clever, and at times, unexpectedly sad. I'm not going to go on and on about each thing I loved, because honestly, I truly loved everything about it. I might have cackled like a crazy person during some parts. I might have teared up a little towards the end. Probably just a piece of dust in my eye. \n Bring on book two!"}
{"text": "This is the first series I ever read by this author. I have been hooked ever since."}
{"text": "After spending the past three years following this series, I can only express my pure disappointment in this train wreck fo a series ender. \n The first novel in the series, while I had a few problems with some of the plot elements (The whole girl wants to sleep with wolves being one of them), I got through it and really felt there was something there. \n Second novel was an improvement, with fresh voices and plot development. And then the third novel came along. I have so much to say and I'll try my best to sum it up. \n Maggie Stiefvater is a very very talented writer. She writes beautifully and uses very rich, lyrical descriptions that make me really see the emotions and actions of the book. But she doesn't close the deal on this series, and before anyone jumps on me as per the end of the book this IS the end of the series. \n So here's my problem. This book focused so much on Cole/Isabelle but I didn't care for them. There was so much focus on these two that the real love of Sam/Grace got lost in translation. \n After the whole lost love of Sam/Grace, you come up with the hundreds of questions that are left unsolved by this novel. Nothing is answered, in fact, more questions come up from this novel than anything else. For example, what is this cure? What happens to it? What happens with Grace and her parents or does she just leave them? What about school? NONE of this is described. \n There is so much time focused on the science part in the first book, and yet nothing is answered. Why are the wolves transforming in MN? Is MN the only place that has this problem? If not why are the other areas not dealing with deaths, etc? How do others handle it? \n Overall, I feel as if I wasted time and energy on a series that fell flat. As a reader I feel cheated, and am sadden that such a talented author had to leave the book as such."}
{"text": "As I got closer and closer to the end of this novel, I started to worry. You see, Hand had done such an amazing job up to that point. First she created several disparate characters, all of whom seemed well-rounded and worthy of my attention, and then she slowly brought their stories together. On top of that, her use of descriptive language was top-notch. (I've never been to England in the spring, but I sure want to go there now!) I wanted to keep living in this world that Hand had created, and I also wanted to see all her characters get their happy endings. But the number of pages was dwindling rapidly, and I didn't see any resolution in sight. So many times I've been disappointed by a book that starts out strong and then peters out at the end, and I didn't want this to be another of those instances. \n Fortunately, I was wrong in my predictions of doom and gloom. Somehow, Hand managed to bring all the pieces together to a very satisfying resolution. While I'm not 100% sure I understand all the implications of everything that happened, I think that might be due to my distracted state while reading this novel. I felt like turning back to page 1 and starting over immediately after I finished, and while I'm not actually going to do that, I'm pretty sure that I will come back to this one in a few years' time."}

I had read my copy at least six or seven times, not to mention the countless times I flipped through and reread my favorite sections with relish. \n There's something about it that I adored.

{"text": "See full review for Hex Hall at: http://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.w... \n So after reading the other reviews for this book on Goodreads, I really, really, wanted to like it. The main character Sophie Mercer was witty and sarcastic in all the right ways. Her angst filled crush on one of the most popular/bad boy persona guys in school was adorable and steamy. Her devotion to her roommate was fantastic. So why didn't I absolutely love this book? Well... \n The story takes place at a boarding school for witches, werewolves, faeries, shape shifters and warlocks called Hecate Hall. The year Sophie attends they're just starting a new transfer student program for vampires and the other species aren't too happy about it. While dealing with that, Sophie also learns that she is in danger from three different hate groups who are out to get her because her father is the Head of the Council. The boy that Sophie is crushing on - Archer - turns out to be working for one of these groups, and she finds out after she's already fallen for him. \n ....does this plot sound familiar to anyone else?"}
{"text": "3.5 STAR--Would give it a solid four if the editing were better. \n This is a fast paced book, full of action and emotion. Kade has spark and tenderness. All the Guardians have a defining quirk that makes them a bit flawed and real. \n Escaping death, Emma has been put on the ride of her life that just might end in her death. She suddenly learns to question everything and that is very confusing to a seventeen year old girl who thought she had a decent grasp on who she was. The one thing she cannot deny is that Kade was meant to be hers--if only she could have him."}
{"text": "Good grade 4 -6 read a little reminiscent of Pullman's Golden Compass ?? \n #1 of many, I'm sure! Thanks Brandon for the autographed copy !!"}
{"text": "I didn't get to read Rapture yet, so I am thinking of doing a re-read for a refresh! I heard there are more books coming out?! Please tell me this is true. *leaps around gleefully*"}
{"text": "What I like about James Maxey is that he grows as a writer. Not many people can admit that something is wrong with the book and change it like he did. I was a little unprepared for the whole sci-fi world jumping that was brought into this series but then again that just made it even better. \n I do have to admit it got a little crazy but in the end it made a lot of sense. I was a little confused about the whole prophets thing and sorta wished there was a middle ground were people did believe in god but weren't crazy. Maybe that'll happen in the third book."}
{"text": "Yet again I am surprised at how much I like this series.My only complaint about the book is that it's so short but I can't deny that the author used every page wisely. This book was overall enjoyable and sweet.I truly look forward to the reading the rest of the series."}
{"text": "still cheesy and obvious."}
{"text": "Disappointing culmination to the series."}
