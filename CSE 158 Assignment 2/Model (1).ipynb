      "Song Lyric: The train slowly gains speed. It takes a while for the machine to reach its cruising speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Andreas has a window seat. He sits there, staring ahead, dully. His gaze seems empty. He does not perceive anything. He does not see anything of the confusing sea of buildings of the sprawling city, the broad maze of train tracks to the right and the left disappearing slowly behind him, sees nothing of the suburbs and mansion quarters of Paris that supersede each other in succession, which glide past in accelerating pacе. And finally only individual groupings of houses in the middle of gardеns, bits and pieces of small towns, and finally only fields under the open sky and the ebb and flow of the telegraph strings, like a billowing sea full of the masts of sunken ships. And bright, colorful, meaningless billboards scream down the train tracks like the calls of people lost ... \"Cinzano\"... \"L'hiver en Egypte\" Without him realizing he imitates their call... This brings a smile to his face...\n",
      "\n",
      "Out of habit he has lit a Caporal-cigarette. He smokes one after the other... He hardly registers that he is smoking... He taps off the ash mechanically on occasion. He stares mechanically into the blue-grey smoke of the cigarette...\n",
      "\n",
      "He falls prey to a complete lethargy of the mind, the kind that follows all too hasty travel preparations in the moment of sudden loneliness when, after finding oneself alone as the train pulls away, one is doomed to inactivity, for an eternity.\n",
      "\n",
      "A terrible thought pushes into Andreas's mind as he suddenly realizes he is abandoned to himself ...How to escape?... Fear fills him... Yet a few moments later, this fear is superseded by a sudden bout of longing... Something stirs in him. His stiffness eases... His inner rigidity had almost transformed during these last days in Paris -- now, during the first half hour of being alone in the compartment has been revealed to him - transformed. Ever since that hour that he knew that salvation and hope existed for him... ever since Elena had handed him the telegram from Berlin... And now he remembers: he had sent a letter to the stranger in Berlin the very same day... And since he put the letter, this odd, hot letter, in the mailbox, he had been overcome by this stiffness... Like an iron curtain that had set on his torn soul...\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly the two beloved faces appear in front of him ... Grete. Elena .. one face next to the other... his companion for many, many years, and through many, many triumphs and defeats... girlfriends both... and slowly both of their faces join into one... he can no longer tell one from the other ... he has but one name left for them: home... home... and now he remembers: Paris... yes, both of them mean Paris to him... and now he has left them all... Grete... Elena... Paris...\n",
      "\n",
      "The big metropolis has long since vanished from view... He looks out the window, as if looking for them... Paris... Elena... Grete...\n",
      "\n",
      "He had not even leaned out the window earlier, when it was time to say farewells... The Eiffel Tower... the white reflection in the air of the sky high dome: Sacre Coeur... Elena... Grete... All had sunken ... lay there as if wiped away under the hazy horizon of the flickering distance... Forever....\n",
      "\n",
      "Forever? Fear touched him.... Yes, forever! Because he, Andreas Sparre, will never return to Paris. He knows that...\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe a different creature... He can't finish the thought. A scream wants to escape him. What people call heart, he feels that now... because a wild pain is quivering in him... And now he has to pull himself together again....\n",
      "\n",
      "Paris... Just think of Paris... With its blue-grey, eternally smiling sky... with its witty, somewhat ironic and yet compassionate expression, that the city on the Seine presents to everyone, which appears like a pardon for stranger and local alike, as forgiving as a good, faithful, understanding sister...\n",
      "\n",
      "Grete... Elena... Paris... This triad accompanies him, the fugitive... fugitive... fugitive... in the rhythm of the journey he suddenly hears it: fugitive ... fugitive ...\n",
      "\n",
      "No... he is not a fugitive... he is ... But what is he?...\n",
      "\n",
      "A bell sounds in the hallway and someone exclaims: \"Le dejeuner premier service.\" Everyone leaves the compartment...\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, that everyone has gone, he realizes for the first time that there were three other people in his compartment, a woman and two gentlemen...\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly he is afraid of being alone. He follows the others. Takes a seat in the restaurant car. He barely touches the meal he ordered, wanders back and stops in front of the window of the hallway. He has to hold on to something. Sneakily the old pain is creeping back in. He feels every bump of the wagon axles against the rail joints...\n",
      "\n",
      "The train races through northern France. Now it has become a true express... He checks his watch. Not even three o'clock... How slow time is passing... uninfluenced by the racing pace of the train...\n",
      "\n",
      "He leans into the corner of his window seat... Between ruins new towns grow from the landscape... Here and there are strange, giant squares with fantastical plantings... No... those are not seed fields... those are fields of crosses... soldiers' graveyards... plantations of death... cross next to cross... into eternity...\n",
      "\n",
      "This reminds him of the recent night's strange dream: the sinister rider, Death, chasing his train...\n",
      "\n",
      "His pain grows... he doesn't want to pay them any attention...\n",
      "\n",
      "The face from the dream refuses to leave him...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If only I get to my destination first.\" He thinks. \"How much more terrible is reality compared to a dream. I could escape the rider of Death... but from my pain ... from myself... can I escape myself?...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He has to think of Grete... Why did he not allow her to come along? She had asked him for it. She never left him alone. Never. And now he forced her to stay behind in Paris... And to wait... No, don't let it get you down, it screams within him. He pulls himself together again, quickly, lights another cigarette and turns off his thoughts...\n",
      "\n",
      "The train has reached the customs border between Belgium and France. He looks out the window apathetically. The compartment is now filled to the last seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The drive through Belgium happens at a snail's pace... Occasionally he paces through the restaurant car, tosses down a cocktail just to kill time ... It is not even six in the evening. ... The train stops at every tiny village. Slowly people enter and exit, as if they had an abundance of time...\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally they reach the German border. And a new locomotive adds new energy to the trip... Night slowly trickles down. The train swoops into darkness...\n",
      "\n",
      "He has sat in the restaurant car for a long while, drank and ate, to numb himself... But also the pain caused by the shaking and rocking of the train... He has to return to his compartment. He can barely keep himself up straight in the corridor. Finally he is back, lying in his corner. He grits his teeth. He closes his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now he has burned all bridges behind him... everything is behind him... in unreachable depths... the past... How strange it sounds: the past... His whole life seems to him like something past... something lost... something astray. He takes apart the meaning of the words: past... astray...\n",
      "\n",
      "And now he lets himself be dragged into this strange land... Lets himself be chased into... Germany... He got to know it only in passing, when passing through. And now this is supposed to become the land of his change in fate... His rebirth... Or...\n",
      "\n",
      "He does not want to think about it. But it doesn't give him peace... Would it not have been better to refrain from this fantastical experiment?.... Because it is still an experiment that they want to do with him... Would it now have been more reasonable to live this life as it was given to him to the end, to see it through, to let it all ebb out of him?...\n",
      "\n",
      "He thinks of the letter he recently wrote to Werner Kreutz: \"I pledge myself to you, come life or death, as long as Lili gets to live on...\" Yes, he had written this a few days ago... And he had to keep his word... And everything of male pride that he still possesses is stirring, touches him. \"I have to get to my destination. I have to persevere.\" He says to himself, under his breath, so that a few of his fellow travelers look at him, questioningly...\n",
      "\n",
      "He has to smile... as to smile at himself... He often did that when fate and sorrow tried smothering him. He is a Dane for a reason.. Copenhagener... Nothing is seen as tragic there... everything receives a smile...\n",
      "\n",
      "So, Andreas says to himself, let's write our own obituary... It could be ... No, let's not get tragic.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then he formulates his obituary as an artist as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The painter Andreas Sparre is dead. He died on the train between Paris and Berlin. His fellow travelers believed him to have fallen asleep in his place in the corner by the window of his compartment – until the train car rocked strongly, possibly from passing over a long switch, and his body fell over. Only then could the cause of his death be determined. The cause of death was probably a heart attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "The happy and harmonious life of an artist found its too early and sudden end. He was still a young person, a man in his best years, with what seemed like a promising future. He seemed to have found his own style recently, after searching and experimenting for a long time. And his latest paintings were found to bear the mark of artistic security and human knowledge. His pictures, most of them created in France and Italy, were sometimes bright and radiating with color, sometimes dark and somewhat gloomy, - but always full of mood and a sense of nature. He preferred two inspirations before all: Paris and its banks of the Seine, bridges and towers, which he could reproduce in their pearly grey, quietly veiled atmosphere, and also landscapes under oppressive skies filled with storms, that served him as a canvas to let buildings and trees light up hectically. – Especially paintings of this kind were a huge success in the large Parisian salons. It was pictures of this latter kind, those powerful, very manly thunderstorm pieces, in which Andreas Sp. found release of his talent.\n",
      "\n",
      "We who knew his delicate, often times effeminate appearance, his smiling, almost funny conversational tone, whenever we visited him in his atelier in Paris, we saw this with wonderment and often had the thought, that everything manly in him, found expression in those strong, somewhat wild and idiosyncratic pictures. In those he manifested an almost pointed virility.\n",
      "\n",
      "He painted very fast. And so it came to pass that he found the time to concern himself with many other things besides painting. He was interested in everything between heaven and earth. His knowledge was quite comprehensive. He was at home in all areas of the arts. One answer we heard from his own mouth was quite distinctive, in Trianon, directed at an older colleague of his. This man had stated his irritation about his younger colleague's beginning of paintings in a too systematic way. \"You have to forgive me that I don't share your opinion,\" Andreas Sp. replied. \"But, I don't believe it is possible to paint the petal of a rose correctly, if one does not know the influences of bas-relief of the Assyrians and the sculptures of the Greeks...\" Another time he said the following: \"I don't get it, how most of my contemporaries treat their art. How quick and easy they are content with their efforts. For me, I fully expect it to take a thousand years before I have become a somewhat acceptable painter.\" That is how serious his art was for Andreas Sp.\n",
      "\n",
      "He spent most of his life away from his home in Denmark, - out in Europe, in Italy, Holland, Germany, - France. Most of the time he lived in Paris. \"I am neither a Dane, nor a Frenchman. No, certainly not French,\" he was often heard saying. \"But I am Parisian. And if that is not a nationality, then I might just not have one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason he had already turned his back to Copenhagen in his younger years, albeit his art was highly valued there from the beginning, was that Copenhagen and Denmark did not seem to him like the right soil for his wife's art, the way Grete Sp. painted. In Copenhagen he had to hear a lot about how people preferred his own paintings to those of his wife. And that was probably the worst thing one could have said about his work. He felt more at home in Paris for the reason alone that the opposite was the case there. His wife's successes felt like his own. Because the main trait of his personality was a sense of chivalry towards his wife, and also towards all women. He lacked ambitions for his own person. Also in regard to his artistic talent. He applied the strictest of standards to himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "His was, by the way, a very complicated, problematic nature. In spite of the various influences one is exposed to in Paris, he remained a true Nordic talent in painting, his art was not concerned with the Romanesque, but completely with all things Germanic. His personality was European. He socialized constantly with French philosophers and writers, with Polish violinists, with Asian architects and German painters.\n",
      "\n",
      "He wrote a book on Nordic legends with a French friend, which has seen many reprints in France, in Paris. This made him a fairly widely read author, at least for Danish circumstances. He was not just a little proud of that. And he was pleased having opened the eyes of Romanesque readers to the Germanic world of ideas, which was an undertaking that deserves praise as creating an intellectual bridge, especially for the time after the first World War--the book appeared in 1924. Thanks to his outstandingly sharp mind he had become one of the foremost interpreters of Europe's most noble muses. In this, too, he proved himself a mediator and negotiator.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without being a practicing musician himself, he cultivated a deep love for music. In this field, too, he possessed a deep understanding and a not insignificant knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these encompassing studies and interests had occupied his free time, and now, in the midst of his best years, he was well equipped to realize his best work, which was a dream of his.\n",
      "\n",
      "His health had not been too good in the past few years. He had complained of pain a lot, but always in a restrained, smiling way, so that even the doctors he eventually had to consult could not have seen or would have easily mistaken the quality of his physical well-being.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now death has – suddenly, and to the deepest anguish of his many friends, near and far – snuffed out this bright and sympathetic artist's life, an artist's life that was dedicated to serious work and the most sacred struggle for art itself, and that must seem like an unfinished novel to those of us who knew him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Full stop,\" said Andreas to himself, smiling, \"Full stop.\" And he thought that the way he had phrased it, someone else would have secretly written this down in a diary, someone else, Grete, his young wife, his most faithful companion... Not so long ago, they all, her too, thought that he, Andreas, would take off in secret, incapable of keeping on living. One night he had found her sleeping over her diary... One night, which followed a day of the worst collapses of his body and mind. Grete never learned of him reading her \"diary entry.\" And when she found him dissolved in tears, he did not want to tell her why he was crying...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" he now said to himself, \"this is what you will be reading about me in a certain paper in Copenhagen, if I am in their good graces. But if a so-called ‘good colleague' at a less well-intentioned paper gets this, ‘the flute would get a different sound'...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And he remembered an encounter with one of those \"good graces\" on the \"Strög\" in Copenhagen, when he was holding an exhibition there. \"To tell you my true opinion,\" the venerable one began, but Andreas interrupted and said with a smile: \"Let's not. As you know, I am quite the boxer.\" And the man suddenly shrank like a freshly pierced pig's bladder, and had disappeared without a sound. A quiet laugh shakes him thinking of this memory... But the laugh died... Uncanny pains began raging inside him again. The rocking of the train car, the bump of the wheels caused him a nameless pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aachen had long passed them. Would they never reach Cologne, he whimpered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Andreas did not order a sleeping compartment. He always detested this kind of modern travel comfort... Getting cooped up with strange people did not agree with him. An insurmountable shame kept him from disrobing in the presence of other men. Only when traveling with Grete could he muster using a sleeping car. Many had laughed at him for this. Only Grete understood his aversion...\n",
      "\n",
      "There is Cologne, finally. All fellow travelers leave the compartment. They have places to sleep, Andreas thinks happily. He is alone. Being alone seems like redemption. Hopefully, he will be able to spend the whole night like this, until they reach Berlin...\n",
      "\n",
      "He gets up, stretches, paces around... He has become quite tired. Sleep. Sleep...\n",
      "\n",
      "After a short while, the train starts moving again. He has lit a new cigarette. Will his pains leave him in peace until he has reached his destination: Berlin...? He folds his hands like a child... To just sleep through this night... Just to not have to think through this night... Just sleep... Just sleep...\n",
      "\n",
      "He lies down on the bench. Falls into a slumber.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he jolts up again. Terrible pain pushes him back down into the upholstery. He is dizzy. A low, cotton like, slightly red fog surrounds him. And then there is only a void, a lightless void around him, and a deep abyss takes him in. His consciousness fades...\n",
      "\n",
      "After an eternity he finds himself on the compartment's floor. He looks around in confusion. He doesn't know. How long has he been lying there?\n",
      "\n",
      "He checks his watch. Twelve o'clock... Oh, my God, it is just midnight. Another seven tortuous hours to Berlin...\n",
      "\n",
      "He tries to rise. He succeeds, finally. He lays back down on the bench, carefully. Thank God he is alone in the compartment. Maybe he will still find sleep. The pain has subsided.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Grete,\" he speaks to himself, \"Grete, to hold your hand now, your cool hand that has helped me so many times. You know, my hand too could help you many times, when you tormented yourself for my sake...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And he takes off his jacket, puts it under his head so he can lie somewhat higher, covers himself with his coat. He was so hot earlier... Now he is chilled. Is he running a fever? Maybe even a high fever? His pulse is racing. The light of the ceiling lamp is insufferable. He closes his eyes. The light seeps through his eyelids.\n",
      "\n",
      "He tries getting back up. Wants to close the drapes on the windows to the corridor. Turn of the light. He succeeds, eventually.\n",
      "\n",
      "And lies back down.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pain stirs back up again. The train races through a station. With a piercing noise. The low lamps on the station shimmer like milky, ghostly shadows. He pulls the coat over his face. That dream from recently... The dark, sinister rider... Is he on his trail?.. He has to have a fever. Is it the delirium that has grasped him? Wasn't there something in front of the window, outside? A shape? A rider?... The sinister rider? A cloak like a sail flew behind him through the dark of night... A pale head with empty, deep eye sockets...\n",
      "\n",
      "He realizes himself how all color rushes from his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "He has to seem as pale as death himself now. He hears the chattering of his teeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "He presses his eyelids down in despair. He wants to see nothing, wants not to know who is outside his window, racing him...\n",
      "\n",
      "The compartment is icy cold. A chill shakes him. Cold sweat trickles from his forehead. His hair is glued to his temples. Was it the rustling of the sinister cloak that he hears now? Yes, he can hear it now, clearly, very clearly, the rushing, louder and louder... Is this where the icy cold that's pouring through the window is coming from?\n",
      "\n",
      "The train slows, the ride ebbs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hannover? ... Hannover!\" someone calls. And again... very distant \"Hannover.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hammer blows against wheels. They are closing in. Now they reached his train car. He can hear the blows underneath his window,- as if they were trying to break his skull. Between the blows he can hear voices speaking German. No matter how hard the noise, it still sounds as if the blows were dampened by cotton somehow...\n",
      "\n",
      "Doors are opened... and thrown shut again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there's a sharp whistle... The train shivers as if it's flexing its muscles. Slowly the train starts moving again. Maybe it is tired, like he is, would rather rest instead engaging in yet another race... Onward to Berlin, thinks Andreas, exhausted. He dully lies on his bench... Then jumps up... The door of his compartment is ripped open. The drapes are pushed aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lady stands in the doorway. Her outline sharply contoured against the light in the corridor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dark of his compartment seems to make her a bit shy at first. But just at first. Then she throws a small suitcase up into the net on the wall and sinks slackly onto the corner seat next to the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Andreas turns the light back on. He doesn't know that he is doing this. Just after the small room is brightly lit does he realize the completely mechanical motions he just went through.\n",
      "\n",
      "He suppresses his discontent about being ripped from his loneliness. The train won't stop again before reaching Berlin, he thinks, suddenly. A terrible thought. So there is no more hope of being alone. Maybe he should move into the adjacent compartment? Maybe it is empty... But he dismisses the thought at once. He cannot appear discourteous... He has to pull himself together. ...He feels his pains. He must not feel them. He does not want anyone to notice. Because there is still that much man in him that does not want to accept a strange creature's pity over his woes...\n",
      "\n",
      "Now he sits up right. Assumes a stiff posture.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is young and elegant.\n",
      "\n",
      "He observes her, without her noticing.\n",
      "\n",
      "He notices the expression of her eyes. She seems to not see him at all, seems not to know that she is sharing the small room with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe she didn't even notice him turning on the light... Maybe he could have left the compartment dark... How comfortable would he have been to pass the night in darkness... Now it is too late. He could ask her... but maybe she would misunderstand...\n",
      "\n",
      "He stares ahead... Looks at his fingers... But soon his eyes are back on her... That odd look, he thinks, as if this strange young woman looked straight through the wall of the compartment... Her eyes have such a distant stare... as if they beheld something unreal...\n",
      "\n",
      "Andreas was overcome by an almost eerie feeling... Maybe she was just a trick his senses played? Did he have a fever high enough to have lost command over his imagination?\n",
      "\n",
      "The heat became unbearable. His throat was parched. He did not understand how it could have gotten this hot in the compartment all of a sudden? Just a moment ago he had been so cold that his teeth were chattering... When would this nightmarish pressure end? Would he ever reach Berlin? Wasn't everything just a bad dream? When would time stop standing still? Why did time not race the train to the destination? Just like that sinister rider...\n",
      "\n",
      "Again the train rushed through a station with a devilish clamor. And again flickering, pale lights shone in through the window... He sprung from his seat to pull the curtains closer together still. Just don't look out the window ...\n",
      "\n",
      "Someone was crying.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked around... He looked upon the young human child over there in the corner. Her face was glazed over with tears. Her crying is not disfiguring the face, he thought quietly. But the stranger was pale. And the tears are just gushing from her eyes. She must have noticed him looking at her... But she does not make the meekest attempt at hiding her crying or drying her tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or had she really not seen that he was sitting there?\n",
      "\n",
      "How odd women are, he thinks. Is there really such a big difference between women and men?... Do they have no pride at all? Are they really that weak?\n",
      "\n",
      "Lili... The question very quietly wells up inside him, Lili, will she become like this? ... Yes, actually she has always been like this... Just like that strange human child over there, that was now sobbing, as if abandoned by all the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "She has to be pretty young. Her ashen hair surrounds a narrow, unblemished girl's forehead. Her eyes are covered with tears, but certainly bright blue and can have somewhat a worry free look.. She has taken off her gloves... On the left she wears a plain band. So a bride...\n",
      "\n",
      "Her travel gown betrays good taste. Her finely painted mouth twitches with excitement...\n",
      "\n",
      "He suddenly feels a deep sense of compassion for this young, unhappy woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mademoiselle,\" he starts, carefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "She seems to not hear him. He probably spoke too softly. The noise of the train covered his words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he remembers that he is in Germany.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Gnädiges Fräulein,\" he repeats, almost ashamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "She raises her tear stained eyes and meets his gaze and finds in his smile a reserved compassion. Her veiled stare loses all stiffness. Her eyelashes have a sweet, silvery sheen, which as he notices, comes from the tears... What a marvelous bride, he thinks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would very much like to help you,\" he says. \"You must have gone through something terrible, mein Fräulein...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He doesn't get any further. She has pressed both hands in front of her face and cries and cries more heart-rending than before and then she hands him, sobbing, a piece of newspaper that she had clasped, folded up, the whole time. Andreas only notices that now. He takes the paper, does not know what do with it, has risen to his feet, sits down next to the crying woman, caresses her hand. She now calms down, puts her other hand on his and begins talking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her fiancé, a well known musician, traveled to Berlin the day before yesterday, to give a concert. Tonight he should have returned. On her way to the station she, by chance, bought a newspaper, the paper he is holding now, and in that she then reads...\n",
      "\n",
      "She points to the front page to one spot, cries again...\n",
      "\n",
      "Andreas reads: \"The young pianist... from Hannover, who gave a successful concert last night in the ... ballroom, crashed his automobile into a streetcar on the way back to his hotel...

      "\n",
      "Her feverishly burning hands again lay in his. He kept her in his embrace for a long time. First they twitched like a captive little bird. But the twitches grew quieter and quieter, until they ceased altogether. He should have been able to find a few words of pathetic solace. He still knew that much German back from school. But he didn't say a word. He simply caressed the girl's soft hands... She too is quiet now. He could hear her low breathing. Just now and then a sob came out of her. And her breath becomes more even... Then Andreas suddenly feels a slight pressure against his left shoulder. Her head has settled against him. She is asleep. Now he feels the beating of her heart against his own hand, which he had to wrap around her to give her support...\n",

A man unendingly burdened, who needs help and assistance like nobody else, and chance has chosen him, to give solace to this until recently complete stranger, a stranger burdened like him. Solace to help her over the possibly hardest hour of her life... And now this small, young German woman, this bride of a complete stranger, lay in his arms... And she and he, both of them, moved, guided by some blind foresight, towards their own fate... Somewhere in Germany...\n",

      "\n",

She is crying again, like a whimpering child that a great injustice was done to, that is suffering, and that does not know why, he thinks, quietly, and then talks to her comfortingly, puts her head against his shoulder again, hugs her again, so he feels her heartbeat against his own arm pulsing, and soon she has fallen asleep again, closely snuggled against him. Odd, odd, he says to himself silently, how is all of this possible? And for what goal have things come together like this tonight?\n",
      "\n",
      "And then a few secret, very hot tears drip from his eyes. He catches them with his lips. They are salty. They are very painful. And he knows, why everything came together like this: this sweet creature from Hannover that was now slumbering in his arms like a trusting child was sent to him as the last woman, that should mean a farewell from others in the deepest sense for him... This unfamiliar German girl, it was no longer unfamiliar to him now. Because she was sent to him so that as a man he could depart from the woman, from the eternal feminine... as a final meeting of the man with the woman...\n",

      "\n",
      "With a frightful exclamation she jolts from her slumber, looks at him, completely puzzled... \"What will come now. What will come now?.. Oh he is dead. He is dead... He cannot be dead.\" Her words drown in tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Child,\" Andreas addresses her softly and with conviction and so securely. \"Child, I don't even know your name, and you don't know mine, and that doesn't matter. But do believe me when I tell you that he is alive!\"\n",

      "\n",
      "A few minutes later they dove into a sea of people in Berlin. Andreas looks after her for a long time. The piece of newspaper she gave him during the night is the only thing that he has of her. \"I have helped you out... Yet I was not a lot farther away from death myself than your lover was... And I know now that both of us will live, he and me as well...\"\n",

      "NOT: It is a cold December evening. A man sat on the edge of a bridge. He is about to take his own life. He looked down below, the cold and calm waters of the bay is ready to welcome its another jumper. He smiled bitterly. His eyes are weary and hopeless.\n",
      "\n",
      "He smelled the air. Like a cannabis smoke, it brought a pleasurable and addicting memory. The memory of the greatest Christmas Eve ever. The night where he came into his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the night before Christmas. In the kitchen, his beautiful and loving Mama prepared their dinner. He remembered the most happiest smile that she had when he gave his present for her. It was an acoustic violin. The one that she spent hours fancying by the storefront. She would always passed by at that store just to see if someone had already bought it. Until one day, the said violin was removed from its place and never to be seen again. After that, she never again visited the store. \n",
      "\n",
      "But it was him who bought it... because it was also him who first witnessed the twinkle in her eyes when it was displayed. Her mother cried profusely. Thanking God that He blessed her with such a wonderful son. They hugged overflowing with love while the ham burned in the pan. \n",
      "\n",
      "After a lovely Christmas dinner, a knock on the door was heard followed by fast footsteps fading away from it. He opened the door expecting carolers but he was greeted by a more lovely and innocent creature - a 2 month old puppy. By its side, a letter laid under a stone. It said;\n",

      "“Merry Christmas!\n",

      "We are from an animal rescue and rehabilitation center which will remain unnamed for some reason. We are heartbroken to inform you that, as of this moment, we are unable to accompany more animals because we have now reached the maximum capacity that we can offer. I hope you find it in your heart to adopt this cute little puppy and give it a home it deserves. May God bless your kind soul. Thank you.”\n",

      "He picked the puppy up, gave it a warm kiss and whispered, “Welcome home.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A powerful sob commenced. He put his hands on his face. He cried as if his heart is breaking into pieces... and it is. Cars are passing by unbothered. The city lights flickered magnificently from afar. It is as if the world around him does not care, as he liked it to be. He doesn’t want to be stopped now. This is his final resolve. “May everybody witness such a wonderful thing”, he thought. \n",
      "\n",
      "He stood on the railing, his feet trembling. He closed his eyes and spread his arms like Jesus on the cross. He took his last breath and prepared for a nosedive.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold on!” a man shouted from behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was surprised that he almost lost his footing and fell. He gave him an angry look and ordered him to stay back. The man remained rooted from his position, seemingly unaffected. His eyes are round and his face shows complete tranquillity . He has a long ponytailed white hair and big grayish beard. He wore a long brown coat and holds a black bowler hat by his side. He is old but looked strong and cheerful.\n",
      "\n",
      "He warned him not to get close and told him that nothing can stop him from killing himself. The man agreed but remained at his place. Finally he talked, “You seem like an interesting man. A man with good stories. You shouldn’t leave this world without someone knowing some of them. You must be remembered and celebrated as you pass, young man.” he said, with his eyes locked on him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I don’t want to be remembered nor celebrated. I don’t have stories to tell you. I want to leave this world like how I entered it, pure and unadulterated. As of now, I am reborn into a new being thus I have no stories. The only experience that I will have with this new body is the tragic feeling of my own demise. Now, leave.” he responded calmly, his eyes showing utmost determination.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man looked confused and dumbfounded but he started to walk away from him. He felt relieved as the man went and, for the second time, closed his eyes. He is about to jump when the man spoke again, this time from his right. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Holy cow! This is going to be a cold one for you, mister!” he shouted astoundingly, as he looked down below the bridge. He is now sitting on the railing. He looked at him and his face displayed a big genuine smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is startled to see the man by his side sitting gently while kicking his feet like a child. He does not know what to do. It also came to him that it feels like he has already met this man before but he came to ignore it afterwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more, the old man spoke. “I am about to die too. Would you be kind to hear my stories before it happen?” he asked, his head suddenly lowered. His eyes displayed sadness and his feet stopped kicking. He looked as if he was about to cry. He stopped himself from doing so and looked at him. \n",
      "\n",
      "“If you are about to die, won’t you like someone else—instead of me, to remember you for a very long time? You know well that we are about to face the same fate. Why me?” he wondered, his words pronouncing sympathy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man scanned around him and looked back at him. “You are the only one around here and I have no time. Sit down.” he answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "He gave the old man a brief scrutinization. He really seemed to be sorrowful and in dire need for someone to talk to. He obliged.  “Don’t you have some family to remember you?” he asked as he sat down on the railing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I only have one family and I’m afraid I might lose him too.” the old man answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is he or she dying?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, he is dying.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The old man shakes his head. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Then why are you not by his side in his final moments?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man laughed cheerfully. He put his hands on the railing and regained a safer position. “Well, it is not the right time for him to die yet. He has a lot more to meet, plenty of places to go and beautiful spots to see. I promise it, though. If the right time comes where he is going to pass, I will be there for him regardless. I will stand by his side, look him in the eye and thank him for everything he has done for me.” he said smiling, with tears in his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I taught you said that he is dying. You are losing me, old man.” he responded confusingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He really is dying... but on the inside.” he said. His face suddenly turned sad.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man kept silent. He is listening to what the old man have to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man continued, “He is a very sad man. Everyday, before going to work, he will put on a mask. A calm and happy one. Then, he will hug me and say goodbye. At work, he will always smile at his colleagues and friends. He will make jokes and laugh with them. He will talk to the boys about the basketball teams that played the night before. When you pass by him, he will greet you and will bless you a good day. You might be able to count his teeth from his mouth because he will always display that beautiful smile of his. No matter how busy he is, he will always be there for me. You look at him and find a kind, happy and outgoing person... but deep inside that shell, he is far beyond from that happiness that he don’t fail to show outside. There will be nights where he will stay inside his room, balled up in the floor; crying his eyes out. There will be mornings where he just don’t feel the need to get up and eat at all. Then the night will come again, and it’s the same thing. I hated every bit of it. Seeing him cry and suffer is the worst thing. I always try to show that I’m there for him. When he cried, I always try to console him with everything that I’ve got. He will always be thankful for me and say that I am the only thing in his life that mattered. And then... I did a stupid thing. A very stupid thing!” he declared while sobbing uncontrollably. His head sulked down and his tears flowed like a river.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man is listening and is filled with compassion for the old man. It somewhat surprised him but he felt a strong empathy for his friend. \n",
      "\n",
      "The old man followed, “Why do I have to leave him? It fills me with regret knowing that I can’t be there for him from now on. The sadness he must have felt today is immeasurable! Oh, my dear friend, I am so sorry! Forgive me for leaving you!” he said while crying.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can’t you go to him right now? If both of you are truly great friends, he will forgive you. I can see that you did not mean to hurt him. You shouldn’t leave his side. Go back to him. He needs you the most.” the young man said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man stopped bawling and then smiled. He used the sleeve of his coat to wipe his wet face and beard. “It gives me great comfort to hear that but it is impossible for me to go back now.” he answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why? Maybe he will still accept you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know that he will be truly thankful to see me now but I can’t. I already told you, I’m dying.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why? Are you sick? Do you have an incurable disease? You seem really vigorous to me.” he said. “Hold on. You are not serious about jumping too, right?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. I don’t have to. Right at this moment, I’m really dying.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“On the inside too?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Okay... Stop messing with me. You just told me that you are not sick nor suicidal. What is it? Why can’t you be with your friend?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Right now, you won’t understand.” he calmly said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man suddenly grew frustrated. He feels that this man is just buying himself time in order to avoid him from jumping. Fuming with annoyance, he quickly stood up and prepared himself to die. “I am done talking to you, sir. I apologize but I have no time for your peculiarities. I am going now. Merry Christmas.”\n",
      "\n",
      "BOOM! \n",
      "\n",
      "A loud explosion is heard from afar. They are both surprised by the sound that echoed through the air. It came from the city. The Christmas fireworks display has started. Every second, the night sky was decorated with beautiful sparkling embers with different colors and shapes. It looked magnificent. The young man watched in amazement. His eyes reflected every outburst. Every second, he eagerly waited until there was none. For a moment there, he forgot where he is. His legs stopped trembling and his heart fluttered with wonder.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked at the old man to see if he too was watching, but he disappeared. He can’t find him anywhere until a voice is heard from below. There is the old man, clinging for his dear life. He is struggling to get himself back up and shouted for help. The young man don’t know what to do. A moment ago, he found his resolution and the second that moment passes, an old bearded man needs his help. \n",
      "\n",
      "He climbed down using the railing and reached for his arm. He managed to grab it but he is not confident in his own strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am going to let go. Pull me up!” the old man shouted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stop being stupid! Don’t let go of that railing! I cannot pull you up alone!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You can do it. I’m sure of it!” and then he let go of his clutch. He dangled under the bridge but his face showed no fear. He truly is confident in his unlikely savior. \n",
      "\n",
      "“You little piece of shit! Don’t you dare fucking die on me!” he screamed as he used up all of his remaining strength to pull up such an old man. He succeeded and they  both get themselves out of that railing. The young man laid on the street in exhaustion while the old man sat beside him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You...are...one...crazy...old man...” the young man said, chasing his breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man laughed in joy as if like he was not within death’s reach just a second ago. The young man sat up with irritation apparent on his face. “What happened to you? One second, I was just watching the fireworks. The next thing I know, I am watching you almost bit the dust!” he bursted out.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not fond of those things. I am truly afraid of them. Those exploding things on the sky and their deafening screams. I hated them. They hurt my ears.” the old man revealed, his forehead wrinkled. “And so when that just happened, I panicked and lost my balance.” he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What an odd old man.” the young one taught and he laid again on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you got any strength to kill yourself right now? I don’t think so, young lad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m still going to do it. I’m just catching my breath. I told you before. This is my resolve. This is what I ought to accomplish as a new man. That and that alone. You shall not stop me.” he said while breathing heavily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I understand but before you do, you might as well tell me your story.” the old man said, looking him eye to eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man looked at him. There is something in that stare that gives purpose to the narrative of his life... and so he obliged again to the old man’s requests. For the second time, he reminded him of someone, especially his voice. But he still can’t manage to see who it is in his mind. He started narrating;\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ten years ago, a Christmas night like this one, i gave my mother the best Christmas gift ever. I bought her the acoustic violin that she really wanted to have. I saved up for a year and used all of them to give it to her as a Christmas present. When she saw it, she was so happy. She was in total euphoria. After that, she thanked me and filled me with kisses ‘til her lips numbed. I asked her to play and so she agreed, excitedly. She stood in front like a professional and performed a piece. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Hear me out. I haven’t heard the angels singing, nor have I been at any opera but there is no doubt in my mind that the best music ever made was not conceived in heaven or any theater in Italy. It happened one Christmas evening, in the kitchen of a very humble abode somewhere in Cavite. It‘s as if she discovered a secret chord that only gods can play. That night she was like the nymph of her own garden and I her victim. Every note is like a lullaby that can put into rest every single babes that were woken up in the middle of the night. Man, I just wish I can hear it right now so I can succumb to death blissfully. I can do it with the smell of a burning ham, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My mom was a part of an orchestra back in her day. She told me that they used to play at big events all around the country. She told me stories of her being chosen to play solo and them being able to compete in Hong Kong in which they almost won. She was always cheerful when I asked her to repeat those stories again and again. I loved the fact that I had an amazing and talented mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I took it away from her. While having those wonderful years as a musician, she unexpectedly got pregnant with me. My useless father did not want to do anything with her and so she decided to raise me by her own. The time came where she has to prioritize taking care of me over her wonderful career. She had to sell her violin in order to gain more money. Then few months came and she was completely replaced in the orchestra. It brought her tremendous unhappiness. I remember her quiet sobs in the middle of the night when I was a kid. That is why I felt the need to bring her the past that she wanted to live once more so badly. She took care of that violin like how she used to with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Later that night, we heard a knock on the door. I opened it with coins on my hands expecting a group of child carolers but I was wrong. What is in our doorstep is something that changed my life forever. It was a little hairy puppy, beside it, a note that asked to adopt it. That night, I met my best friend - Lucius.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I brought him into the family. He became like my little brother. I always feed him and he loved foods soaked with gravy. I always bathe him, even when he hated it. Every month, I will cut his beautiful and silky fur and then I will make a cute little pigtail on his head. I used to teach him how to fetch but to no avail because he is such a silly little pup. One day, I saw him in a corner coughing. He ingested a coin and choked on it. I picked him up and shook him. Shook him like this! Shook him fool ‘til he puke out that inch-long silver copper! My mother saw me and yelled at me for cursing profusely while I save my friend’s life. After that incident, he grimaces at the sight of a coin or anything silver-y, for that matter. \n",
      "\n",
      "“He is my furry little champ. He never fails to look at me with such innocence and love so pure. His eyes are round and full of life and when he looks at me, I can see that he needs me. I love that about him the most. I am more than happy to know that I have someone in this world who truly needs me. Especially after my mother died.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Eight years ago, she was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer. The tumor had already spread inside her chest and her other organs too. Unfortunately, we do not have much money for the treatment that she needs. She was devastated. She cried and cried until she can no longer. Everyday, I will try to cheer her up. We would watch movies every night. Every weekends, I would bring her somewhere nice. After work, I would bring her her favorite foods... Every time, she smiled and thanked me. But none of those can make her as happy as those beautiful nights where she played for me and Lucius. The harmony that she made with her fingers and arms were the only treatment that she needed in order to face the fact that she is dying. After a year and a half, she finally did. She passed away peacefully. When she was buried, I put her violin next to her so that she can teach the little angels how to play. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Succeeding that year, my heart was a huge mess. I missed her so much that nothing in this world can make me forget the feeling of her death. She was the only family I have and in a snap of a finger she was gone. It felt awful. I can’t sleep. I can’t eat. I can’t even get up. My bed was soaked with sweat and tears. Day after day, life had slowly withdrew from my body. My phone kept ringing and it was my boss and colleagues, wondering why it’s been so long since they saw me at work. From time to time a knock on the door was heard but no one answered it. I felt powerless. It’s like a huge chunk of my being was sliced away from my body and now I do not know what to do. I lost a purpose and that purpose is my anchor. Right then, I was floating into nothingness, far away from the soils of hope and meaning. I closed my eyes and wont to succumb to every fiber of Darkness that awaits me. I saw it and it looked beautiful—like a paradise. “Finally, a place that will end my loneliness and suffering. This is where I truly belong. Take me, my Lord.” I said unto it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s long prickly fingers wrapped around my neck. I can feel it’s cold breath on the back of my head. I shivered but remained on my place. Finally I moved forward and he started to strangle me. At first I fought it. I kicked my feet convulsively and put my hands on his long fingers. But then, I remembered my reasons. I put my hands on my sides and let it happen. That’s when someone shouted at me;\n",
      "\n",
      "“You little piece of shit! Don’t you dare fucking die on me! Get down! Please! I’m begging you! Don’t do this! Get the fuck down! Please, I need you! I love you! You are my only best friend! I love you—“ and the voice bawled hysterically. I opened my eyes to see who it was. I saw Lucius. My sweet little Luci. He kept barking at me. He kept jumping up trying to reach me while I dangled on the roof with a knotted blanket. Right at that moment, while my eyes shot blood, I found another place. A home in my friend’s heart. Finally I worked my hands on the blanket and managed to untie it before I lose consciousness. Lucius rushed at me and licked away every stain of Darkness on me. I hugged him tight and promised to never do such a thing again. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Up until this moment, it still bugs me how I manage to hear him speak while I’m in the dark place. But the more I think of it, the more I remained anchored. I found a new meaning and it kept me going. I am really thankful that he came into my life. For ten years that he has been with me, he brought nothing but joy and love. Even at his old age, he never stopped loving me... Whoever left him in that doorstep have no idea what a great thing he or she has made.”\n",

      "The young man then sat up. He snatched something from his back pocket and handed it to the old man. It was a handful of crumpled bond papers. The old man looked at the contents inside. It is a big picture of a mixed Shih Tzu breed with writing above that said MISSING. The old man read the information below the picture. It is clear, Lucius has been missing. He looked at the young man with complete compassion in his face and pat his shoulders. The young man continued his gaze upon the stars and then spoke;\n",
      " \n",
      "“I lost him two days ago. That morning, I quickly prepared myself for work. Before I went, I rubbed him and told him I’ll be back soon. I rushed outside and closed the door. While running, I found out that I had forgotten my notebook. I went back for it and kept on with the day. When I got back home, he is not by the door waiting impatiently. I called for his name a lot of times but nothing. I looked for him all around the house and I still can’t find him. He must have gotten out when I was in my room looking for my notebook. I looked all around the street and then all over the city. I cannot find him anywhere. At that point, I was extremely anxious. I went to the nearest police precinct to ask for help. They told me that they can see what they can do. I go back outside, wandered at every possible place that he might be and shouted for him. It’s been two days. Two days of not hearing his cute and small barks. Two days of not smelling the stench of his urine. Two days of nonstop anxiety and sadness. My Luci. He must be scared and hungry right now.” his head fell down and tears escaped from his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man moved closer. He can’t find the right words to console such a dreading person. He just put his arms around his shoulders and shook him softly. The young man put his elbows on his knees and curled. He lamented quietly. They just both sat is silence beside a long bridge in a cold Christmas evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the young man straightened his legs and stood up. He looked as if he regained a small portion of strength when he talked about his life. He took a glance at the old man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There you go. Now you know my story. Should you remember or celebrate it, it is up to you. You told me you’re dying anyway so I don’t see point of you even trying. Nonetheless, I am really grateful that you are here to listen. Thank you and I apologize that you have to witness me as I take my own life.” he said with a smile on his face. He put his hands on the railing and climbed up. He felt the air in his face, a cold breeze gently wiped his tears. He is now more ready than ever. He closed his eyes and met Darkness for the second time. This time, it is below his feet and ready to receive his body on its freezing and rushing bosom. “Take me.” he whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You little piece of shit. Don’t you dare fucking die on me.” \n",
      "\n",
      "A voice echoed from his back. He has heard it before. It’s the same voice. But this time, he is speaking softly. It’s Lucius. His best buddy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man opened his eyes and looked back. The old man stood blissfully. His eyes showed great worry and care. “Get down from there. Don’t do this. I’m begging you. Please.” he said while his lips trembled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am here. I’ve always been here with you. Please get your ass back down from there. Stay right here with me.” he added. His eyes are pleading.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man froze. He cannot believe what is happening. He cannot comprehend the events that‘s transpiring right in front of him. What is happening? Who is this man? Why did he sound like Lucius just now?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Please. I need you. I love you.” the old man said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then it hit him like an arrow. Suddenly, the thoughts on his mind stopped stirring. Now he understands why he reminds him of someone. He finally recognizes that round innocent eyes and those white grayish hair. The ponytail on his head, he knows it very well. That clear voice from the dark place that made him wonder for his entire life. His fear of fireworks! Like him it hurt his ears! The way he kicked his feet joyfully, like a wagging of a tail when he finally comes home. Those same fucking words! The profusely cursing when a friend’s about to die! Oh, it is now lining up in his brain like trained soldiers. Every single piece of connection. Every fragment of a broken picture. He knows him. For the last ten years, he knows nothing better than him. And it is him all this time. \n",
      "\n",
      "“You can’t be—“ he mumbled in amazement. His eyes blurred with tears. His hands were shaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I haven’t thanked you yet. Please stay.” the old man said with a handsome smile on his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I haven’t had the chance to tell you how I felt when you shook me. It was remarkable. You saved my life but might still end up in hell for having such a filthy mouth. I haven’t had the chance to say to you how much I cared. How it breaks me every time you cry. How I wished that I can snatch it away from you and take it for myself. I am so sorry for being so useless in your dark days. I haven’t had the chance to tell you how I felt when I saw you on your bedroom, dangling from the roof. It killed me... and right now it is the same fucking thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I really wanted to talk to you about your mother. I wished I can tell her how much I loved her for taking care of both of us. There are times that I see her beside you when you are sad. She would always tell you to be strong even when you can’t see or hear her. One day, she touched me and told me to always be there for you. I promised her. I told her that I will never leave your side and she hugged me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man withdraw from the railing. His eyes wet with tears. Slowly, he came to the old man while he kept talking;\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve always wanted to tell you how thankful I am that you brought me in. You gave me a beautiful and loving home. Words cannot begin how blessed I am that night on your doorstep. I will never forget the look on your face when I first saw you. It was breathtaking. You looked at me and you knew I have captured your heart. From that moment on, I vowed to myself that I am going to be your best friend. That I am going to love you with all of my heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you for loving such a hopeless and stupid dog like me. Thank you for all those hugs and kisses. They truly made me happy. Thank you for saving me and making me a home in your gigantic heart. Thank you for everything that you’ve done for me. Thank you for the best ten years that I had in your arms. You are my greatest friend. I love you so much.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the young man grabbed the old man and hugged him tightly. His head buried in his shoulder. The old man put his hand on his head and patted it. \n",
      "\n",
      "“It is you! It is really you!” the young man kept repeating.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am here. I will always be.” the old man answered, still patting his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What happened to you? How are you like this?” the young man asked him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man smiled at him and wiped away his face with the sleeves of his coat. “I am here because as I told you I am dying. This body you’re holding is my spirit. My last wish before it happen is to see you, to know how you’ve been holding up. Thankfully, I managed to find you at the last second. You scared me for real right there. You really are about to jump.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man was taken aback. He looked at him alarmingly. “No, no, no, no. Please stay. Don’t die. Where are you? I’m coming for you! Please tell me where are you right now!” he said in panic.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s too late. I’m already out of breath and someone is waiting for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who?”\n",

      "“Your dear ol’ friend. Darkness.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Please don’t go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man put his hands on his face and kissed his forehead. He gave him an angelic smile and said, \n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s time. I have to go now. Always remember, everyday I will be beside you. I will celebrate alongside you when you are happy. I will cry alongside too when you are sad. You might not see it but I will never ever leave you from now on. So be brave. Be strong. You will never fight alone because you can no longer be. Always remember that. Always.” he said, and let go. He then started to fade away with the wind but the smile on his face did not falter until his last grain disappeared. \n",
      "\n",
      "The young man stood silently and sobbed. In the end, he dropped his knees on the concrete floor and kept crying. After some time, he stood up and looked above the night sky. The moon looked as bright as his new found resolve, his new starting line. It is now clear to him. He is now equipped with something more supreme than a metal sword and more unbreakable than a golden shield. He found the purpose of his life. Through countless suffering, it showed its real face. He must give meaning to his own being. He must create it, take care of it and hold onto it forever.\n",

      "——\n",
      "\n",
      "The next year, the young man entered a university. He entered a room full of slightly younger folks and sat at the back. The professor managed to see him and asked him his name. He answered it and said that he is a new student. He was asked if he would like to introduce himself to the class and he agreed. He stood in the front and started;\n",

      "“Few years ago, I was in the lowest point of my life. I am severely depressed and has two failed suicides on my agenda. But the last one changed me. It gave me a newer and stronger mindset.

I ought to support them find the real meaning of their lives.\n",

      "The other day I threw a big barbecue at my house and invited a hundred of my closest friends. These types of gatherings aren’t unusual. My brother-in-law, Cartheu, and I have been barbecuing for years, and my skills have earned me the nickname from my African American friends “the Jackie Robinson of Barbecue.” I crossed the color line.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this particular barbecue, the conversation turned to the great rapper Nas. My friend Tristan Walker, a young African American entrepreneur, commented proudly that Nas was from his home project, Queensbridge, New York—one of the largest public housing projects in the United States. My seventy-three-year-old Jewish father interjected, “I’ve been to Queensbridge.” Convinced that there was no way that my old, white father had been to Queensbridge, Tristan said, “You must mean Queens. Queensbridge is actually a housing project in an extremely rough neighborhood.” My father insisted: No, it was Queensbridge.\n",
      "\n",
      "I pointed out to Tristan that my father grew up in Queens, so he couldn’t possibly be confused. Then I asked, “Dad, what were you doing in Queensbridge?” He replied, “I was passing out communist literature when I was eleven years old. I remember it well, because my mother got very upset that the Communist Party sent me into the projects. She thought it was too dangerous for a little kid.”\n",
      "\n",
      "My grandparents were actually card-carrying Communists. As an active member in the Communist Party, my grandfather Phil Horowitz lost his job as a schoolteacher during the McCarthy era. My father was a red-diaper baby and grew up indoctrinated in the philosophy of the left. In 1968, he moved our family west to Berkeley, California, and became editor of the famed New Left magazine Ramparts.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, I grew up in the city affectionately known by its inhabitants as the People’s Republic of Berkeley. As a young child, I was incredibly shy and terrified of adults. When my mother dropped me off at nursery school for the first time, I began to cry. The teacher told my mother to just leave, while reassuring her that crying was common among nursery school children. But when Elissa Horowitz returned three hours later, she found me soaking wet and still crying. The teacher explained that I hadn’t stopped, and now my clothes were drenched as a result. I got kicked out of nursery school that day. If my mother hadn’t been the most patient person in the world, I might never have gone to school. When everybody around her recommended psychiatric treatment, she was patient, willing to wait until I got comfortable with the world, no matter how long it took.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was five years old, we moved from a one-bedroom house on Glen Avenue, which had become far too small for a six-person family, to a larger one on Bonita Avenue. Bonita was middle-class Berkeley, which means something a bit different from what one finds in most middle-class neighborhoods. The block was a collection of hippies, crazy people, lower-class people working hard to move up, and upper-class people taking enough drugs to move down. One day, one of my older brother Jonathan’s friends, Roger (not his real name), was over at our house. Roger pointed to an African American kid down the block who was riding in a red wagon. Roger dared me: “Go down the street, tell that kid to give you his wagon, and if he says anything, spit in his face and call him a nigger.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A few things require clarification here. First, we were in Berkeley, so that was not common language. In fact, I had never heard the word nigger before and didn’t know what it meant, though I guessed it wasn’t a compliment. Second, Roger wasn’t racist and he wasn’t raised in a bad home. His father was a Berkeley professor and both his parents were some of the nicest people in the world, but we later found out that Roger suffered from schizophrenia, and his dark side wanted to see a fight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roger’s command put me in a difficult situation. I was terrified of Roger. I thought that he would surely give me a severe beating if I didn’t follow his instructions. On the other hand, I was terrified of asking for the wagon. Hell, I was terrified of everything. I was much too scared of Roger to stay where I was, so I began walking down the block toward the other kid. The distance was probably thirty yards, but it felt like thirty miles. When I finally got there, I could barely move. I did not know what to say, so I just opened my mouth and started talking. “Can I ride in your wagon?” is what came out. Joel Clark Jr. said, “Sure.” When I turned to see what Roger would do, he was gone. Apparently, his light side had taken over and he’d moved on to something else. Joel and I went on to play all day that day, and we’ve been best friends ever since. Eighteen years later, he would be the best man at my wedding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Until now, I’ve never told that story to anyone, but it shaped my life. It taught me that being scared didn’t mean I was gutless. What I did mattered and would determine whether I would be a hero or a coward. I have often thought back on that day, realizing that if I’d done what Roger had told me to do, I would have never met my best friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "That experience also taught me not to judge things by their surfaces. Until you make the effort to get to know someone or something, you don’t know anything. There are no shortcuts to knowledge, especially knowledge gained from personal experience. Following conventional wisdom and relying on shortcuts can be worse than knowing nothing at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "TURN YOUR SHIT IN\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the years, I worked hard to avoid being influenced by first impressions and blindly adhering to convention. Growing up in Berkeley as an excellent student in a town that frowned upon football as being too militaristic, I wasn’t expected to join the Berkeley High School football team, but that’s what I did. This was a big step for me. I had not played in any of the peewee football leagues, so it was my first exposure to the sport. Nonetheless, those earlier lessons in dealing with fear helped me tremendously. In high school football, being able to handle fear is 75 percent of the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will never forget the first team meeting with head coach Chico Mendoza. Coach Mendoza was a tough old guy who had played college football at Texas Christian University, home of the mighty Horned Frogs. Coach Mendoza began his opening speech, “Some of you guys will come out here and you just won’t be serious. You’ll get here and start shooting the shit, talking shit, bullshittin’, not doing shit, and just want to look good in your football shit. If you do that, then you know what? Turn your shit in.” He went on to elaborate on what was unacceptable: “Come late to practice? Turn your shit in. Don’t want to hit? Turn your shit in. Walk on the grass? Turn your shit in. Call me Chico? Turn your shit in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the most intense, hilarious, poetic speech I’d ever heard. I loved it. I couldn’t wait to get home and tell my mother. She was horrified, but I still loved it. In retrospect, it was my first lesson in leadership. Former secretary of state Colin Powell says that leadership is the ability to get someone to follow you even if only out of curiosity. I was certainly curious to see what Coach Mendoza would say next.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was the only kid on the football team who was also on the highest academic track in math, so my teammates and I didn’t see each other in many classes. As a result, I ended up moving in multiple social circles and hanging out with kids with very different outlooks on the world. It amazed me how a diverse perspective utterly changed the meaning of every significant event in the world. For instance, when Run-D.M.C.’s Hard Times album came out, with its relentless bass drum, it sent an earthquake through the football team, but not even a ripple through my calculus class. Ronald Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative was considered an outrage among young scientists due to its questionable technical foundation, but those aspects went unnoticed at football practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the world through such different prisms helped me separate facts from perception. This ability would serve me incredibly well later when I became an entrepreneur and CEO. In particularly dire circumstances when the “facts” seemed to dictate a certain outcome, I learned to look for alternative narratives and explanations coming from radically different perspectives to inform my outlook. The simple existence of an alternate, plausible scenario is often all that’s needed to keep hope alive among a worried workforce.\n",

      "BLIND DATE\n",
      "\n",
      "In the summer of 1986, I had finished my sophomore year of college at Columbia University, and I was staying with my father, who was now living in Los Angeles. I had been set up on a blind date by my friend and high school football teammate Claude Shaw. Claude and I got ready for the double date with his girlfriend, Jackie Williams, and my date, Felicia Wiley, by preparing an elaborate dinner. We meticulously planned and cooked all day and had the entire meal, including four perfectly presented T-bone steaks, ready at 7 p.m.—date time. But there were no dates. An hour passed, but we didn’t get too worked up. Jackie was known for her tardiness, so no worries. Then two hours passed, and Claude called for a status check. I listened in shock as I looked over the now-cold gourmet meal that we’d prepared. My date, Felicia, had decided that she was “too tired” to show up for the date. Wow. How obnoxious!\n",
      "\n",
      "I told Claude to hand me the phone. I introduced myself: “Hi, this is Ben, your blind date.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Felicia: “I am sorry, but I am tired and it is late.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Me: “Well, it is late, because you are late.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Felicia: “I know, but I am just too tired to come over.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point I decided to appeal to her sense of empathy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Me: “Well, I understand your predicament, but the time to communicate this message would have been before we spent all day cooking dinner. At this point, anything short of getting into your car and driving here immediately would be rude and leave a permanently poor impression.”\n",
      "\n",
      "If she was totally self-centered (as she appeared to be), my plea would have no effect, and I would be better off missing the date. On the other hand, if she didn’t want to go out like that, then there might be something there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Felicia: “Okay, I’ll come over.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Ninety minutes later she arrived wearing white shorts and looking as pretty as can be. In all my focus and anticipation about the date, I had completely forgotten about the fistfight I’d been in the day before. During a pickup basketball game in the San Fernando Valley, a six-foot-two-inch, crew-cut-sporting, camouflage-pants- wearing, fraternity-boy-looking player threw the ball at my brother. Jonathan was a musician, had long hair, and probably weighed about 155 pounds at the time. On the other hand, I was used to football and fighting and was ready for action. I judged the situation on my first impression, and I rushed the frat boy. A scuffle ensued. I landed some good punches but caught a right hook under my left eye, leaving a bit of a mark. It’s possible that my target player was simply mad about a hard foul rather than trying to bully my brother, but that’s the price of not taking the time to understand. I will never know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever the case, when I opened the door to greet our dates, Felicia’s award-winning green eyes immediately fixed on the welt under my eye. Her first impression (told to me years later): “This guy is a thug. Coming here was a big mistake.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately, neither of us relied on our first impressions. We have been happily married for nearly twenty-five years and have three wonderful children.\n",
      "\n",
      "SILICON VALLEY\n",
      "\n",
      "During one summer in college, I got a job as an engineer at a company called Silicon Graphics (SGI). The experience blew my mind. The company invented modern computer graphics and powered a whole new class set of applications ranging from the movie Terminator 2 to amazing flight simulators. Everybody there was so smart. The things they built were so cool. I wanted to work for Silicon Graphics for the rest of my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "After graduating from college and graduate school in computer science, I went back to work for SGI. Being there was a dream come true and I loved it. After my first year at SGI, I met a former head of marketing for the company, Roselie Buonauro, who had a new startup. Roselie had heard about me from her daughter, who also worked with me at SGI. Roselie recruited me hard. Eventually, she got me and I went to work for her at NetLabs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joining NetLabs turned out to be a horrible decision for me. The company was run by Andre Schwager, a former Hewlett-Packard executive, and more important, Roselie’s husband. Andre and Roselie had been brought in by the venture capitalists as the “professional management team.” Unfortunately, they understood very little about the products or the technology, and they sent the company off in one crazy direction after the next. This was the first time that I started to understand the importance of founders running their companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make matters more complicated, my second daughter, Mariah, had been diagnosed with autism, which made working at a startup a terrible burden for our family, as I needed to spend more time at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "One very hot day my father came over for a visit. We could not afford air-conditioning, and all three children were crying as my father and I sat there sweating in the 105-degree heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "My father turned to me and said, “Son, do you know what’s cheap?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Since I had absolutely no idea what he was talking about, I replied, “No, what?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Flowers. Flowers are really cheap. But do you know what’s expensive?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, I replied, “No, what?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He said, “Divorce.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Something about that joke, which was not really a joke, made me\n",
      "realize that I had run out of time. Up until that point, I had not really made any serious choices. I felt like I had unlimited bandwidth and could do everything in life that I wanted to do simultaneously. But his joke made it suddenly clear that by continuing on the course I was on, I might lose my family. By doing everything, I would fail at the most important thing. It was the first time that I forced myself to look at the world through priorities that were not purely my own. I thought that I could pursue my career, all my interests, and build my family. More important, I always thought about myself first. When you are part of a family or part of a group, that kind of thinking can get you into trouble, and I was in deep trouble. In my mind, I was confident that I was a good person and not selfish, but my actions said otherwise. I had to stop being a boy and become a man. I had to put first things first. I had to consider the people who I cared about most before considering myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided to quit NetLabs the next day. I found a job at Lotus Development that would allow me to get my home life straightened out. I stopped thinking about myself and focused on what was best for my family. I started being the person that I wanted to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "NETSCAPE\n",
      "\n",
      "One day while working at Lotus, one of my coworkers showed me a new product called Mosaic, which was developed by some students at the University of Illinois. Mosaic was essentially a graphical interface to the Internet—a technology formerly only used by scientists and researchers. It amazed me. It was so obviously the future, and I was so obviously wasting my time working on anything but the Internet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several months later, I read about a company called Netscape, which had been cofounded by former Silicon Graphics founder Jim Clark and Mosaic inventor Marc Andreessen. I instantly decided that I should interview for a job there. I called a friend who worked at Netscape and asked if he could get me an interview with the company. He obliged and I was on my way.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the first interviews, I met everyone on the product management team. I thought the meetings went well, but when I arrived home that evening Felicia was in tears. The Netscape recruiter had called me to give me some tips, and Felicia had answered. (This was before the days of pervasive cell phones.) The recruiter informed her that it would be unlikely I’d get the job, because the group was looking for candidates with Stanford or Harvard MBAs. Felicia suggested that maybe I could go back to school. Given that we had three children, she knew this was unrealistic, hence the tears. I explained that recruiters were not hiring managers, and that they might consider me despite my lack of proper business schooling.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day the hiring manager called back to let me know that they wanted me to interview with cofounder and Chief Technical Officer Marc Andreessen. He was twenty-two years old at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "In retrospect, it’s easy to think both the Web browser and the Internet were inevitable, but without Marc’s work, it is likely that we would be living in a very different world. At the time most people believed only scientists and researchers would use the Internet. The Internet was thought to be too arcane, insecure, and slow to meet real business needs. Even after the introduction of Mosaic, the world’s first browser, almost nobody thought the Internet would be significant beyond the scientific community—least of all the most important technology industry leaders, who were busy building proprietary alternatives. The overwhelming favorites to dominate the race to become the so-called Information Superhighway were competing proprietary technologies from industry powerhouses such as Oracle and Micro- soft. Their stories captured the imagination of the business press. This was not so illogical, since most companies didn’t even run TCP/IP (the software foundation for the Internet)—they ran proprietary net- working protocols such as AppleTalk, NetBIOS, and SNA. As late as November 1995, Bill Gates wrote a book titled The Road Ahead, in which he predicted that the Information Superhighway—a network connecting all businesses and consumers in a world of frictionless commerce—would be the logical successor to the Internet and would rule the future. Gates later went back and changed references from the Information Superhighway to the Internet, but that was not his original vision.\n",
      "\n",
      "The implications of this proprietary vision were not good for business or for consumers. In the minds of visionaries like Bill Gates and Larry Ellison, the corporations that owned the Information Superhigh- way would tax every transaction by charging a “vigorish,” as Microsoft’s then–chief technology officer, Nathan Myhrvold, referred to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s difficult to overstate the momentum that the proprietary Information Superhighway carried. After Mosaic, even Marc and his cofounder, Jim Clark, originally planned a business for video distribution to run on top of the proprietary Information Superhighway, not the Internet. It wasn’t until deep into the planning process that they decided that by improving the browser to make it secure, more functional, and easier to use, they could make the Internet the network of the future. And that became the mission of Netscape—a mission that they would gloriously accomplish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewing with Marc was like no other job interview I’d ever had. Gone were questions about my résumé, my career progression, and my work habits. He replaced them with a dizzying inquiry into the history of email, collaboration software, and what the future might hold. I was an expert in the topic, because I’d spent the last several years working on the leading products in the category, but I was shocked by how much a twenty-two-year-old kid knew about the history of the computer business. I’d met many really smart young people in my career, but never a young technology historian. Marc’s intellect and instincts took me aback, but beyond Marc’s historical knowledge, his insights about technologies such as replication were incisive and on point. After the interview, I phoned my brother and told him that I’d just interviewed with Marc Andreessen, and I thought that he might be the smartest person I’d ever met.\n",
      "\n",
      "A week later, I got the job. I was thrilled. I didn’t really care what the offer was. I knew that Marc and Netscape would change the world, and I wanted to be part of it. I could not wait to get started.\n",
      "Once at Netscape, I was put in charge of their Enterprise Web Server product line. The line consisted of two products: the regular Web server, which listed for $1,200, and the secure Web server (a Web server that included the then brand-new security protocol invented by Netscape called SSL, Secure Sockets Layer) for $5,000. At the time that I joined, we had two engineers working on the Web servers: Rob McCool, who had invented the NCSA Web server, and his twin brother, Mike McCool.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time Netscape went public in August 1995, we had grown the Web server team to about nine engineers. The Netscape initial public offering (IPO) was both spectacular and historic. The stock initially priced at $14 per share, but a last-minute decision doubled the initial offering to $28 per share. It spiked to $75—nearly a record for a first-day gain—and closed at $58, giving Netscape a market value of nearly $3 billion on the day of the IPO. More than that, the IPO was an earthquake in the business world. As my friend and investment banker Frank Quattrone said at the time, “No one wanted to tell their grandchildren that they missed out on this one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The deal changed everything. Microsoft had been in business for more than a decade before its IPO; we’d been alive for sixteen months. Companies began to get defined as “new economy” or as “old economy.” And the new economy was winning. The New York Times called the Netscape IPO “world-shaking.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was a crack in our armor: Microsoft announced that it would be bundling its browser, Internet Explorer, with its upcoming breakthrough operating system release, Windows 95—for free. This posed a huge problem to Netscape, because nearly all of our revenue came from browser sales, and Microsoft controlled more than 90 percent of operating systems. Our answer to investors: We would make our money on Web servers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two months later, we got our hands on an early release of Microsoft’s upcoming Web server Internet Information Server (IIS). We deconstructed IIS and found that it had every feature that we had— including the security in our high-end product—and was five times faster. Uh-oh. I figured that we had about five months before Microsoft released IIS to solve the problem or else we would be toast. In the “old economy,” product cycles typically took eighteen months to complete, so this was an exceptionally short time frame even in the “new economy.” So I went to see our department head, Mike Homer.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the possible exception of Marc, Mike Homer was the most significant creative force behind Netscape. More important, the worse a situation became, the stronger Mike would get. During particularly brutal competitive attacks, most executives would run from the press. Mike, on the other hand, was always front and center. When Microsoft unveiled its famous “embrace and extend” strategy—a dramatic pivot to attack Netscape—Mike took every phone call, sometimes even talking to two reporters at once with a phone in each hand. He was the ultimate warrior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mike and I spent the next several months developing a comprehensive answer to Microsoft’s threat. If they were going to give our products away, then we were going to offer a dirt-cheap, open alternative to the highly expensive and proprietary Microsoft BackOffice product line. To do so, we acquired two companies, which provided us with a competitive alternative to Microsoft Exchange. We then cut a landmark deal with the database company Informix to provide us unlimited relational database access through the Web for $50 a copy, which was literally hundreds of times less than Microsoft charged. Once we assembled the entire package, Mike named it Netscape SuiteSpot, as it would be the “suite” that displaced Microsoft’s Back-Office. We lined everything up for a major launch on March 5, 1996, in New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, just two weeks before the launch, Marc, without telling Mike or me, revealed the entire strategy to the publication Computer Reseller News. I was livid. I immediately sent him a short email:\n",
      "\n",
      "To: Marc Andreessen\n",
      "Cc: Mike Homer\n",
      "From: Ben Horowitz\n",
      "Subject : Launch\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess we’re not going to wait until the 5th to launch the strategy.\n",
      "—Ben\n",
      "\n",
      "Within fifteen minutes, I received the following reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "To: Ben Horowitz\n",
      "Cc: Mike Homer, Jim Barksdale (CEO), Jim Clark (Chairman)\n",
      "From: Marc Andreessen\n",
      "Subject: Re: Launch\n",
      "\n",
      "Apparently you do not understand how serious the situation is. We are getting killed killed killed out there. Our current product is radically worse than the competition. We’ve had nothing to say for months. As a result, we’ve lost over $3B in market capitalization. We are now in danger of losing the entire company and it’s all server product management’s fault.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next time do the fucking interview yourself. Fuck you, Marc. I received this email the same day that Marc appeared barefoot and sitting on a throne on the cover of Time magazine. When I first saw the cover, I felt thrilled. I had never met anyone in my life who had been on the cover of Time. Then I felt sick. I brought both the magazine and the email home to Felicia to get a second opinion. I was very worried. I was twenty-nine years old, had a wife and three children, and needed my job. She looked at the email and the magazine cover and said, “You need to start looking for a job right away.”\n",
      "In the end, I didn’t get fired and over the next two years, SuiteSpot grew from nothing to a $400 million a year business. More shocking, Marc and I eventually became friends; we’ve been friends and business partners ever since.\n",
      "\n",
      "People often ask me how we’ve managed to work effectively across three companies over eighteen years. Most business relationships either become too tense to tolerate or not tense enough to be productive after a while. Either people challenge each other to the point where they don’t like each other or they become complacent about each other’s feedback and no longer benefit from the relationship. With Marc and me, even after eighteen years, he upsets me almost every day by finding something wrong in my thinking, and I do the same for him. It works.\n",
      "\n",
      "STARTING A COMPANY\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of 1998 and under immense pressure from Microsoft, which used the full force of its operating system monopoly to subsidize free products in every category in which Netscape competed, we sold the company to America Online (AOL). In the short term, this was a big victory for Microsoft since it had driven its biggest threat into the arms of a far less threatening competitor. In the long term, however, Netscape inflicted irreparable damage on Microsoft’s stronghold on the computing industry: our work moved developers from Win32 API, Microsoft’s proprietary platform, to the Internet. Someone writing new functionality for computers no longer wrote for Microsoft’s proprietary platform. Instead, they wrote to the Internet and World Wide Web’s standard interfaces. Once Microsoft lost its grip on developers, it became only a matter of time before it lost its monopoly on operating systems. Along the way, Netscape invented many of the foundational technologies of the modern Internet, including JavaScript, SSL, and cookies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once inside AOL, I was assigned to run the e-commerce platform and Marc became the chief technology officer. After a few months, it became apparent to both of us that AOL saw itself as more of a media company than a technology company. Technology enabled great new media projects, but the strategy was a media strategy and the top executive, Bob Pittman, was a genius media executive. Media companies focused on things like creating great stories whereas technology companies focused on creating a better way of doing things. We began to think about new ideas and about forming a new company.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the process, we added two other potential cofounders to the discussion. Dr. Timothy Howes was coinventor of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), a masterful simplification of its byzantine X.500 predecessor. We hired Tim into Netscape in 1996 and together we successfully made LDAP the Internet directory standard. To this day, if a program is interested in information about a person, it accesses that information via LDAP. The fourth member of our team was In Sik Rhee, who had cofounded an application server company called Kiva Systems, which Netscape had acquired. He had been acting as CTO of the e-commerce division that I ran and, in particular, worked closely with the partner companies in making sure that they could handle the AOL scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we discussed ideas, In Sik complained that every time we tried to connect an AOL partner on the AOL e-commerce platform, the partner’s site would crash, because it couldn’t handle the traffic load. Deploying software to scale to millions of users was totally different from making it work for thousands. And it was extremely complicated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, there ought to be a company that does all that for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we expanded the idea, we landed on the concept of a computing cloud. The term cloud had been used previously in the telecommunications industry to describe the smart cloud that handled all the complexity of routing, billing, and the like, so that one could plug a dumb device into the smart cloud and get all the smart functionality for free. We thought the same concept was needed in computing, so that software developers wouldn’t have to worry about security, scaling, and disaster recovery. And if you are going to build a cloud, it should be big and loud, and that’s how Loudcloud was born. Interestingly, the most lasting remnant of Loudcloud is the name itself, as the word cloud hadn’t been previously used to describe a computing platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "We incorporated the company and set out to raise money. It was 1999.\n",

      "Song Lyric: In 1962, Charles Van Doren, who was later a senior editor of Britannica, said the ideal encyclopedia should be radical -- it should stop being safe. But if you know anything about the history of Britannica since 1962, it was anything but radical: still a very completely safe, stodgy type of encyclopedia. Wikipedia, on the other hand, begins with a very radical idea, and that's for all of us to imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that's what we're doing. So Wikipedia -- you just saw the little demonstration of it -- it's a freely licensed encyclopedia. It's written by thousands of volunteers all over the world in many, many languages. It's written using Wiki software -- which is the type of software he just demonstrated -- so anyone can quickly edit and save, and it goes live on the Internet immediately. And everything about Wikipedia is managed by virtually an all-volunteer staff. So when Yochai is talking about new methods of organization, he's exactly describing Wikipedia. And what I'm going to do today is tell you a little bit more about how it really works on the inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Wikipedia's owned by the Wikimedia Foundation, which I founded, a nonprofit organization. And our goal, the core aim of the Wikimedia Foundation, is to get a free encyclopedia to every single person on the planet. And so if you think about what that means, it means a lot more than just building a cool website. We're really interested in all the issues of the digital divide, poverty worldwide, empowering people everywhere to have the information that they need to make good decisions. And so we're going to have to do a lot of work that goes beyond just the Internet. And so that's a big part of why we've chosen the free licensing model, because that empowers local entrepreneurs -- or anyone who wants to, can take our content and do anything they like with it -- you can copy it, redistribute it and you can do it commercially or non-commercially.\n",
      "\n",
      "So there's a lot of opportunities that are going to arise around Wikipedia all over the world. We're funded by donations from the public, and one of the more interesting things about that is how little money it actually takes to run Wikipedia. So Yochai showed you the graph of what the cost of a printing press was. And I'm going to tell you what the cost of Wikipedia is, but first I'll show you how big it is. So we've got over 600,000 articles in English. We've got two million total articles across many, many different languages. The biggest languages are German, Japanese, French -- all the Western European languages are quite big. But only around one-third of all of our traffic to our web clusters to the English Wikipedia, which is surprising to a lot of people. A lot of people think in a very English-centric way on the Internet, but for us, we're truly global. We're in many, many languages. How popular we've gotten to be -- we're a top 50 website and we're more popular than the New York Times. So this is where we get to Yochai's discussion.\n",
      "\n",
      "This shows the growth of Wikipedia -- we're the blue line there -- and then this is the New York Times over there. And what's interesting about this is the New York Times website is a huge, enormous corporate operation with -- I have no idea how many hundreds of employees. We have exactly one employee, and that employee is our lead software developer. And he's only been our employee since January 2005, all the other growth before that. So the servers are managed by a rag-tag band of volunteers; all the editing is done by volunteers. And the way that we're organized is not like any traditional organization you can imagine. People are always asking, \"Well, who's in charge of this?\" or \"Who does that?\" And the answer is: anybody who wants to pitch in. It's a very unusual and chaotic thing. We've got over 90 servers now in three locations. These are managed by volunteer system administrators who are online. I can go online any time of the day or night and see eight to 10 people waiting for me to ask a question or something, anything about the servers. You could never afford to do this in a company. You could never afford to have a standby crew of people 24 hours a day and do what we're doing at Wikipedia.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we're doing around 1.4 billion page views monthly, so it's really gotten to be a huge thing. And everything is managed by the volunteers. And the total monthly cost for our bandwidth is about 5,000 dollars. And that's essentially our main cost. We could actually do without the employee. We actually -- we hired Brian because he was working part-time for two years and full-time at Wikipedia, so we actually hired him so he could get a life and go to the movies sometimes. So the big question when you've got this really chaotic organization is, why isn't it all rubbish? Why is the website as good as it is?\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, how good is it? Well, it's pretty good. It isn't perfect, but it's much, much better than you would expect, given our completely chaotic model. So when you saw him make a ridiculous edit to the page about me, you think, oh, this is obviously just going to degenerate into rubbish. But when we've seen quality tests -- and there haven't been enough of these yet and I'm really encouraging people to do more, comparing Wikipedia to traditional things -- we win hands down.\n",
      "\n",
      "So a German magazine compared German Wikipedia, which is really much, much smaller than English, to Microsoft Encarta and to Brockhaus Multimedia, and we won across the board. They hired experts to come and look at articles and compare the quality, and we were very pleased with that result. So a lot of people have heard about the Wikipedia Bush-Kerry controversy. The media has covered this somewhat extensively. It started out with an article in Red Herring. The reporters called me up and they -- I mean, I have to say they spelled my name right, but they really wanted to say, the Bush-Kerry election is so contentious, it's tearing apart the Wikipedia community. And so they quote me as saying, \"They're the most contentious in the history of Wikipedia.\" What I actually said is, they're not contentious at all. So it's a slight misquote. (Laughter) The articles were edited quite heavily. And it is true that we did have to lock the articles on a couple of occasions. Time magazine recently reported that \"Extreme action sometimes has to be taken, and Wales locked the entries on Kerry and Bush for most of 2004.\" This came after I told the reporter that we had to lock it for -- occasionally a little bit here and there. So the truth in general is that the kinds of controversies that you would probably think we have within the Wikipedia community are not really controversies at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Articles on controversial topics are edited a lot, but they don't cause much controversy within the community. And the reason for this is that most people understand the need for neutrality. The real struggle is not between the right and the left -- that's where most people assume -- but it's between the party of the thoughtful and the party of the jerks. And no side of the political spectrum has a monopoly on either of those qualities. The actual truth about the specific Bush-Kerry incident is that the Bush-Kerry articles were locked less than one percent of the time in 2004, and it wasn't because they were contentious; it was just because there was routine vandalism -- which happens sometimes even on stage, people -- sometimes even reporters have reported to me that they vandalize Wikipedia and were amazed that it was fixed so quickly. And I said -- you know, I always say, please don't do that; that's not a good thing. So how do we do this? How do we manage the quality control? How does it work?\n",
      "\n",
      "So there's a few elements, mostly social policies and some elements of the software. So the biggest and the most important thing is our neutral point-of-view policy. This is something that I set down from the very beginning, as a core principle of the community that's completely not debatable. It's a social concept of cooperation, so we don't talk a lot about truth and objectivity. The reason for this is if we say we're only going to write the \"truth\" about some topic, that doesn't do us a damn bit of good of figuring out what to write, because I don't agree with you about what's the truth. But we have this jargon term of neutrality, which has its own long history within the community, which basically says, any time there's a controversial issue, Wikipedia itself should not take a stand on the issue. We should merely report on what reputable parties have said about it. So this neutrality policy is really important for us, because it empowers a community that is very diverse to come together and actually get some work done.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we have very diverse contributors in terms of political, religious, cultural backgrounds. By having this firm neutrality policy, which is non-negotiable from the beginning, we ensure that people can work together and that the entries don't become simply a war back and forth between the left and the right. If you engage in that type of behavior, you'll be asked to leave the community. So real-time peer review. Every single change on the site goes to the recent changes page. So as soon as he made his change, it went to the recent changes page. That recent changes page was also fed into IRC channel, which is an Internet chat channel that people are monitoring with various software tools. And people can get RSS feeds -- they can get e-mail notifications of changes. And then users can set up their own personal watch list. So my page is on quite a few volunteers' watch lists, because it is sometimes vandalized. And therefore, what happens is someone will notice the change very quickly, and then they'll just simply revert the change.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a new pages feed, for example, so you can go to a certain page of Wikipedia and see every new page as it's created. This is really important, because a lot of new pages that get created are just garbage that have to be deleted, you know, ASDFASDF. But also that's some of the most interesting and fun things at Wikipedia, some of the new articles. People will start an article on some interesting topic, other people will find that intriguing and jump in and help and make it much better. So we do have edits by anonymous users, which is one of the most controversial and intriguing things about Wikipedia. So Chris was able to do his change -- he didn't have to log in or anything; he just went on the website and made a change. But it turns out that only about 18 percent of all the edits to the website are done by anonymous users. And that's a really important thing to understand, is that the vast majority of the edits that go on on the website are from a very close-knit community of maybe 600 to 1,000 people who are in constant communication. And we have over 40 IRC channels, 40 mailing lists. All these people know each other. They communicate; we have offline meetings.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are the people who are doing the bulk of the site, and they are, in a sense, semi-professionals at what they're doing, that the standards we set for ourselves are equal to or higher than professional standards of quality. We don't always meet those standards, but that's what we're striving for.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so that tight community is who really cares for the site, and these are some of the smartest people I've ever met. Of course, it's my job to say that, but it's actually true. The type of people who were drawn to writing an encyclopedia for fun tend to be pretty smart people. (Laughter)\n",
      "\n",
      "The tools and the software: there's lots of tools that allow us -- allow us, meaning the community -- to self-monitor and to monitor all the work. This is an example of a page history on \"flat earth,\" and you can see some changes that were made. What's nice about this page is you can immediately take a look at this and see, oh OK, I understand now. When somebody goes and looks at -- they see that someone, an anonymous IP number, made an edit to my page -- that sounds suspicious -- who is this person? Somebody looks at it -- they can immediately see highlighted in red all of the changes that took place, to see, OK, well, these words have changed, things like this. So that's one tool that we can use to very quickly monitor the history of a page.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing that we do within the community is we leave everything very open-ended. Most of the social rules and the methods of work are left completely open-ended in the software. All of that stuff is just on Wiki pages. And so there's nothing in the software that enforces the rules. The example I've got up here is a Votes For Deletion page. So, I mentioned earlier, people type ASDFASDF -- it needs to be deleted. Cases like that, the administrators just delete it. There's no reason to have a big argument about it. But you can imagine there's a lot of other areas where the question is, is this notable enough to go in an encyclopedia? Is the information verifiable? Is it a hoax? Is it true? Is it what? So we needed a social method for figuring out the answer to this. And so the method that arose organically within the community is the Votes For Deletion page. And in the particular example we have here, it's a film, \"Twisted Issues,\" and the first person says, \"Now this is supposedly a film. It fails the Google test miserably.\" The Google test is, you look in Google and see if it's there, because if something's not even in Google, it probably doesn't exist at all. It's not a perfect rule, but it's a nice starting point for quick research. So somebody says, \"Delete it, please. Delete it -- it's not notable.\" And then somebody says, \"Wait, wait, wait, wait, I found it. I found it in a book, 'Film Threat Video Guide: the 20 Underground Films You Must See.'\" Oh, OK. So the next persons says, \"Clean it up.\" Somebody says, \"I've found it on IMDB. Keep, keep, keep.\" And what's interesting about this is that the software is -- these votes are just -- they're just text typed into a page. This is not really a vote so much as it is a dialogue. Now it is true that at the end of the day an administrator can go through here and take a look at this and say, OK, 18 deletes, two keeps: we'll delete it. But in other cases, this could be 18 deletes and two keeps, and we would keep it, because if those last two keeps say, \"Wait a minute, wait a minute. Nobody else saw this but I found it in a book, and I found a link to a page that describes it, and I'm going to clean it up tomorrow, so please don't delete it,\" then it would survive. And it also matters who the people are who are voting. Like I say, it's a tight knit community. Down here at the bottom, \"Keep, real movie,\" Rick Kay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rick Kay is a very famous Wikipedian who does an enormous amount of work with vandalism, hoaxes and votes for deletion. His voice carries a lot of weight within the community because he knows what he's doing. So how's all this governed? People really want to know about, OK, administrators, things like that. So the Wikipedia governance model, the governance of the community, is a very confusing, but a workable mix of consensus -- meaning we try not to vote on the content of articles, because the majority view is not necessarily neutral. Some amount of democracy, all of the administrators -- these are the people who have the ability to delete pages, that doesn't mean that they have the right to delete pages; they still have to follow all the rules -- but they're elected; they're elected by the community. Sometimes people -- random trolls on the Internet -- like to accuse me of handpicking the administrators to bias the content of the encyclopedia. I always laugh at this, because I have no idea how they're elected, actually. There's a certain amount of aristocracy. And so you've got a hint of that when I mentioned, like, Rick Kay's voice would carry a lot more weight than someone we don't know.\n",
      "\n",
      "I give this talk sometimes with Angela, who was just re-elected to the Board from the community -- to the Board of the Foundation, with more than twice the votes of the person who didn't make it. And I always embarrass her because I say, well, Angela, for example, could get away with doing absolutely anything within Wikipedia, because she's so admired and so powerful. But the irony is, of course, that Angela can do this because she's the one person who you know would never, ever, ever break any rules of Wikipedia. And I also like to say she's the only person who actually knows all the rules of Wikipedia, so ... And then there's monarchy and that's my role on the community, so ... I was describing this in Berlin once and the next day in the newspaper the headline said, \"I am the Queen of England.\" And that's not exactly what I said (Laughter), but -- the point is my role in the community -- within the free software world there's been a longstanding tradition of the \"benevolent dictator\" model. So if you look at most of the major free software projects, they have one single person in charge who everyone agrees is the benevolent dictator. Well, I don't like the term \"benevolent dictator,\" and I don't think that it's my job or my role in the world of ideas to be the dictator of the future of all human knowledge compiled by the world. It just isn't appropriate. But there is a need still for a certain amount of monarchy, a certain amount of -- sometimes we have to make a decision, and we don't want to get bogged down too heavily in formal decision-making processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "So as an example of why this has been -- or how this can be important: we recently had a situation where a neo-Nazi website discovered Wikipedia, and they said, \"Oh, well, this is horrible, this Jewish conspiracy of a website and we're going to get certain articles deleted that we don't like. And we see they have a voting process, so we're going to send -- we have 40,000 members and we're going to send them over and they're all going to vote and get these pages deleted.\" Well, they managed to get 18 people to show up. That's neo-Nazi math for you. They always think they've got 40,000 members when they've got 18. But they managed to get 18 people to come and vote in a fairly absurd way to delete a perfectly valid article. Of course, the vote ended up being about 85 to 18, so there was no real danger to our democratic processes. On the other hand, people said, \"But what are we going to do? I mean, this could happen and what if some group gets really seriously organized and comes in and wants to vote?\" Then I said, \"Well fuck it, we'll just change the rules.\" That's my job in the community: to say we won't allow our openness and freedom to undermine the quality of the content. And so as long as people trust me in my role, then that's a valid place for me. Of course, because of the free licensing, if I do a bad job, the volunteers are more than happy to take and leave -- I can't tell anyone what to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the final point here is that to understand how Wikipedia works, it's important to understand that our Wiki model is the way we work, but we are not fanatical web anarchists. In fact, we're very flexible about the social methodology, because it's ultimately the passion of the community is for the quality of the work, not necessarily for the process that we use to generate it. Thank you. (Applause)\n",
      "\n",
      "Ben Saunders: Yeah, hi, Ben Saunders. Jimmy, you mentioned impartiality being a key to Wikipedia's success. It strikes me that much of the textbooks that are used to educate our children are inherently biased. Have you found Wikipedia being used by teachers, and how do you see Wikipedia changing education?\n",
      "\n",
      "Jimmy Wales: Yeah, so, a lot of teachers are beginning to use Wikipedia. There's a media storyline about Wikipedia, which I think is false. It builds on the storyline of bloggers versus newspapers. And the storyline is, there's this crazy thing, Wikipedia, but academics hate it and teachers hate it. And that turns out to not be true. The last time I got an e-mail from a journalist saying, \"Why do academics hate Wikipedia?\" I sent it from my Harvard email address, because I was recently appointed a fellow there. And I said, \"Well, they don't all hate it.\" (Laughter) But I think there's going to be huge impacts. And we actually have a project that I'm personally really excited about, which is the Wiki books project, which is an effort to create textbooks in all the languages. And that's a much bigger project; it's going to take 20 years or so to come to fruition. But part of that is to fulfill our mission of giving an encyclopedia to every single person on the planet. We don't mean we're going to spam them with AOL-style CDs. We mean we're going to give them a tool that they can use. And for a lot of people in the world, if I give you an encyclopedia that's written at a university level, it doesn't do you any good without a whole host of literacy materials to build you up to the point where you can actually use it. And so the Wiki books project is an effort to do that. And I think that we're going to really see a huge -- it may not even come from us; there's all kinds of innovation going on. But freely licensed textbooks are the next big thing in education.\n",

My husband can’t sleep and he’s worked the whole way through lockdown. Our three kids are woken up multiple times a night when the parties go on. I’ve tried asking her politely and she says our kids wake her up when they’re playing in the paddling pool. Our neighbour on the other side works nights so I don’t let the kids play until midday so they’re not waking her up first thing. Anyway a few nights ago another party started and it woke our kids up. I opened the window and shouted “Alexa play barbie girl by aqua” and it played. She stops the song but a few songs later I ask for it to be played again. Tonight there’s  another party so I think barbie girl will be getting played more. It’s petty I know but the five of us our exhausted.\n",

      "Song Lyric: There's a man in the habit of hitting me on the head with an umbrella. It's exactly five years today that he's been hitting me on the head with his umbrella. At first I couldn't stand it; now I'm used to it.\n",
      "       I don't know his name. I know he's average in appearance, wears a gray suit, is graying at the temples, and has a common face. I met him five years ago one sultry morning. I was sitting on a tree-shaded bench in Palermo Park, reading the paper. Suddenly I felt something touch my head. It was the very same man who now, as I'm writing, keeps whacking me, mechanically and impassively, with an umbrella.\n",
      "       On that occasion I turned around filled with indignation: he just kept on hitting me. I asked him if he was crazy: he didn't even seem to hear me. Then I threatened to call a policeman. Unperturbed, cool as a cucumber, he stuck with his task. After a few moments of indecision, and seeing that he was not about to change his attitude, I stood up and punched him in the nose. The man fell down, and let out an almost inaudible moan. He immediately got back on his feet, apparently with great effort, and without a word again began hitting me on the head with the umbrella. His nose was bleeding and, at that moment, I felt sorry for him. I felt remorse for having hit him so hard. After all, the man wasn't exactly bludgeoning me; he was merely tapping me lightly with his umbrella, not causing any pain at all. Of course, those taps were extremely bothersome. As we all know, when a fly lands on your forehead, you don't feel any pain whatsoever; what you feel is annoyance. Well then, that umbrella was one humongous fly that kept landing on my head time after time, and at regular intervals.\n",
      "       Convinced that I was dealing with a madman, I tried to escape. But the man followed me, wordlessly continuing to hit me. So I began to run (at this juncture I should point out that not many people run as fast as I do). He took off after me, vainly trying to land a blow. The man was huffing and puffing and gasping so that I thought, if I continued to force him to run at that speed, my tormenter would drop dead right then and there.\n",
      "\n",
      "       That's why I slowed down to a walk. I looked at him. There was no trace of either gratitude or reproach on his face. He merely kept hitting me on the head with the umbrella. I thought of showing up at the police station and saying, \"Officer, this man is hitting me on the head with an umbrella.\" It would have been an unprecedented case. The officer would have looked at me suspiciously, would have asked for my papers and begun asking embarrassing questions. And he might even have ended up placing me under arrest.\n",
      "       I thought it best to return home. I took the 67 bus. He, all the while hitting me with his umbrella, got on behind me. I took the first seat. He stood right beside me, and held on to the railing with his left hand. With his right hand he unrelentingly kept whacking me with that umbrella. At first, the passengers exchanged timid smiles. The driver began to observe us in the rearview mirror. Little by little the bus trip turned into one great fit of laughter, an uproarious, interminable fit of laughter. I was burning with shame. My persecutor, impervious to the laughter, continued to strike me.\n",
      "       I got off—we got off—at Pacifico Bridge. We walked along Santa Fe Avenue. Everyone stupidly turned to stare at us. It occurred to me to say to them, \"What are you looking at, you idiots? Haven't you ever seen a man hit another man on the head with an umbrella?\" But it also occurred to me that they probably never had seen such a spectacle. Then five or six little boys began chasing after us, shouting like maniacs.\n",
      "       But I had a plan. Once I reached my house, I tried to slam the door in his face. That didn't happen. He must have read my mind, because he firmly seized the doorknob and pushed his way in with me.\n",
      "       From that time on, he has continued to hit me on the head with his umbrella. As far as I can tell, he has never either slept or eaten anything. His sole activity consists of hitting me. He is with me in everything I do, even in my most intimate activities. I remember that at first, the blows kept me awake all night. Now I think it would be impossible for me to sleep without them.\n",
      "\n",
      "       Still and all, our relations have not always been good. I've asked him, on many occasions, and in all possible tones, to explain his behavior to me. To no avail: he has wordlessly continued to hit me on the head with his umbrella. Many times I have let him have it with punches, kicks, and even—God forgive me—umbrella blows. He would meekly accept the blows. He would accept them as though they were part of his job. And this is precisely the weirdest aspect of his personality: that unshakable faith in his work coupled with a complete lack of animosity. In short, that conviction that he was carrying out some secret mission that responded to a higher authority.\n",
      "       Despite his lack of physiological needs, I know that when I hit him, he feels pain. I know he is weak. I know he is mortal. I also know that I could be rid of him with a single bullet. What I don't know is if it would be better for that bullet to kill him or to kill me. Neither do I know if, when the two of us are dead, he might not continue to hit me on the head with his umbrella. In any event, this reasoning is pointless; I recognize that I would never dare to kill him or kill myself.\n",
      "       On the other hand, I have recently come to the realization that I couldn't live without those blows. Now, more and more frequently, a certain foreboding overcomes me. A new anxiety is eating at my soul: the anxiety stemming from the thought that this man, perhaps when I need him most, will depart and I will no longer feel those umbrella taps that helped me sleep so soundly.\n",

      "NOT:  As a young Caucasian male studying African American relations at an HBCU I’ve learned about the significant importance of civil rights leaders such as MLK. However, one evening whilst studying I listened to a song called “Rockstar” by hip-hop artist DaBaby. After I heard the beautiful and elegant lyricism from DaBaby I came to a stunning conclusion. DaBaby is the modern day MLK. When DaBaby says “fuck a cop car” he represents the desires of African Americans to fight systemic racism in our police forces throughout this country. When DaBaby mentions “My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me” it is a clear statement about the state of the military industrial complex, similar in premise to statements made by former President Eisenhower. DaBaby shows an understanding of the state of this military industrial complex by stating his weapon wishes to be used. DaBaby is clearly making a statement that as a result of the growing power and influence of the military industrial complex, we believe as a nation we are obligated into conflict in order to use said weapons, fulfilling said promise to “squeeze” the glock. I am truly stunned and shocked such a civil rights visionary was laying unnoticed for so long.\n",

I have come to take you away to my Emporium on the hill, where the change hums on wires.

      "1.\tSubnarrative: Will and Elizabeth’s romance with it’s distorted mirror reflection – tragical love story of Davy Jones and Tia Dalma. Will and Elizabeth violate social norms for the sake of love, that they praise above everything else. In the first part of the trilogy Will’s character develops by violating social norms, in the second part – by acknowledging the fact, that violation is being followed by redemption (Will’s father’s storyline), and in the third part of the trilogy Will keeps developing by violating even moral norms in desperate attempts to save his father, and these attempts distance him from Elizabeth, yet in the end of the trilogy he finally gains humility and takes the responsibility for everything he has done – and thus it lets him be with Elizabeth at least once per decade, which is the payment for all the wrongdoings and violations. So, love in the social norms discourse is tied with sacrifice’s and responsibilities taken, and thus it raises value of love (their target) and, also, justifies violation of norms.                                                                                                                            \n",
      "2.\tSubnarrative: Jacks vengeance upon Barbossa as he considers him a traitor, and their interpersonal conflict. As a result of series of interconnections Jack gets his pay-off on Barbossa in the first movie, yet all the characters of the trilogy adopt Barbossa’s understanding of social norms as just a guidelines, not laws, and a need of reaching their personal goals no matter what, so at some point of view Barbossa has won over Jack. At the end of the trilogy Barbossa once again inspires mutiny on a Black Pearl and leaves Jack behind. Jack, besides his personal development, stays at the same position where he was at the start of the trilogy. Jack and Barbossa’s storyline ends ciclycally. Their interpersonal relationships serve as a catalyst for developing and personal growth of the other characters in the social norms discourse, Jack and Barbossa being mentors for others and acting purely as a counter forces with a different view’s on social norms, thus influencing others.                                                                \n",
      "3.\tSubnarrative: Norrington’s, as a sentinels of the law, tragedy. Norrington’s tragedy is rooting in his loyalty to a written law, because him being legalist lets him ignore and sacrifice other social norms, such as moral norms, for the sake of written law to be executed. At the end of the first part of the trilogy he retreats from this legalist path and the written law in favor of moral norms, letting Jack Sparrow get away, and in the second movie he already suffers the consequences of the choice he made, and this suffering leads him to overstep moral norms as well, to correct his mistake. And so in the third movie Norrington being a man of a strict code who has violated first the norms of the law and then the moral norms, that led to a terrible consequences, seeking for a redemption – sacrifices himself to reach the goal of moral righteousness. Thus, legalist, sentinel of the written law dies because of his inability to live with such a burden of violation of the moral code, thus completing highest moral virtue – self-sacrifice. Moral code overcomes written laws.\n",

      "I do uphold the view, that discourse method of analysis needs to be concentrated on a question “How”, not “Why” and it is significant to understand how discourse does what it does, or what it has done. I do consider that the main thing, while analysing social norms discourse in “Pirates of Caribbean” film trilogy is getting the answer to a question of “What is and how did develop social norms discourse in motion pictures trilogy “Pirates of Caribbean” ...\n",

      "On May 5th, 1993 the lives of 6 families were forever rocked, catapulting each and every family into a state of depression some still experience today. Stripped naked, hogtied with their own shoelaces, hands and ankles tied behind their back, the bodies of Michael Moore, Steven “Stevie” Branch, and Christopher (Chris) Byers were found in a muddy creek bed by the West Memphis Police Department in a location that had been already searched, The Robin Hood Woods on May 6th, 1993. The body of Christopher Byers had lacerations of different degrees to multiple parts of his body with the castration of his scrotum and penis. The face of Stevie was essentially ripped apart. Their clothes were found in the creek where they were discovered, turned inside out, and was twisted around muddy sticks. Upon this discovery, West Memphis Police speculated the boys had been raped and assumed some sort of satanic ritual occurred. \n",
      "\n",
      "Within a month, police already believed they had found the perpetrators, and with the confession of 17-year-old Jessie Misskelley Jr., they became convinced they had a solid case. The West Memphis Three refers to the teenage boys charged in the murders, 18-year-old Damien Echols, 16-year-old Jason Baldwin, and 17-year-old Jessie Misskelley Jr. On May 7th, 1993 just 1 day after the discovery of the boys' bodies, Damien Echols was interviewed by West Memphis Police, with no notes being recorded. 2 days later, Damien and Jason were formally interviewed and denied any involvement, and mentioned they had never even heard of the 3 boys that had been killed. According to investigators, Damien mentioned one of the victims had wounds to his genitals, furthering police to think they had their man. Detective Bill Durham subjected Damien to a polygraph test, seeing signs of deception he claims “Damien had been untruthful during the polygraph examination and was involved in the murders.” \n",
      "\n",
      "With an IQ of just 72, placing him the category of borderline mental retardation, Jessie Misskelley Jr. was interviewed by police on June 3rd, 1993 without any parents present despite police knowing he was a minor. Enduring police interrogation for 12 hours, Jessie confessed to involvement in the murders as well as implicating Damien and Jason, but quickly recanted citing coercion, deception, and intimidation made by police. Only 45 minutes of that 12 hours was recorded by police. Misskelley claimed he was informed of his Miranda Rights, but did not understand them. Later that day warrants for the arrest of Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin, and Jessie Misskelley Jr. were issued, each charged with capital murder, The West Memphis 3 Trials were now underway. During a public conference, Chief Inspector Gary Gitchell was asked by a reporter \"On a scale of 1 to 10, how solid do you think this case is\" he responded with \"eleven\".\n",
      "\n",
      "It was ruled by Judge David Barnett that Jessie’s confession would be admissible in the trial despite the coercive undertones. He also ruled that Jessie should be tried separately in a different county, and the 3 boys were to be charged as adults rather than juveniles. All entered pleas of not guilty and maintained their innocence throughout their trials. \n",
      "\n",
      "Richard Ofshe, a professor at UC Berkley and expert in false confessions, testified in Jessie’s trial that the 45 minutes of footage recorded of the interrogation was a “classic example” of police coercion and false confessions. Police claimed the boys were raped and their anuses showed signs of dilation. Although, no evidence showed any trauma to the boys' anuses.  One of the key pieces of evidence, according to the prosecution, was the alleged confession made by Jessie. In the coerced confession, Jessie claims he saw Damien hit one of the boys then rape him followed by Jason hitting Stevie. During the trial of Damien and Jason, an Occult expert was brought in to testify on behalf of the prosecution arguing the boys mirrored satanic religious tendencies. The Modern-day Witch trial ended in the guilty conviction of all three boys. Damien Echols was sentenced to death by lethal Injection, while Jessie Misskelley and Jason Baldwin were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. \n",
      "\n",
      "The epidemic of wrongful convictions has clouded our justice system on the exact purpose it thrives on- justice. It is time to acknowledge the flawed system that wrongfully equates us to be “Home of the Free”. This case epitomizes how police can flawly handle a case, ruining lives in the process. \n",
      "\n",
      "After spending almost 2 decades incarcerated, Damien, Jessie, and Jason were freed from prison on the basis of an Alford plea. A plea deal encompassing the standpoint of being guilty under the eyes of the law, but still maintaining your innocence. They were granted time served, but under this plea, they cannot take any civil action against the state. After hours of researching this case, it is my personal belief that The West Memphis Three were not involved in the murders of Stevie Branch, Michael Moore, and Chris Byers. But if they did not murder those boys, then who did?\n",
      "\n",
      "Vickie Hutcheson, a West Memphis resident, came out in 2003 saying her testimony during Damien and Jason’s trial was a lie due to coercion by the police. Vickie told police that 2 weeks after the murders occurred, she attended a Wiccan meeting with Damien and Jessie, where Damien drunkenly confessed to killing the 3 boys. She was unable to account the location of that alleged meeting and the other members that attended. Once she admitted her guilt, she reasoned that she implicated Damien and Jessie to avoid being prosecuted for theft, and hoping to earn a reward for putting murderers away.  \n",

      "The Mr. Bojangles Theory\n",
      "\n",
      "On May 5th, 1993, the night the boys were murdered, workers of the Bojangles Fast Food establishment reported an African American man, bleeding, muddy, and disorientated, inside the women’s bathroom. Occurring just a mile away from where the boys were found, and around the time the boys would have been killed, it is plausible this could be our man. The Oxygen Documentary Series, “The Forgotten West Memphis Three” attempts to decipher this puzzle, and examines the Bojangles angle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional Suspects\n",
      "\n",
      "Fleeing West Memphis just 4 days after the murders, Brian Holland and Chris Morgan were briefly suspects in the early days of the investigation. May 17th, 1993 Brian Holland and Chris Morgan were given a polygraph test under the suspicion of them being involved in the murders after being arrested In Oceanside California. California police claimed their polygraphs showed signs of deception when asked about involvement in the murders. During an interview, Chris Morgan told investigators about his history of drug and alcohol abuse. Indicating that he sometimes experiences blackouts and lapses in memory and “might have” killed the boys. He later recanted this statement. There is no indication of West Memphis police acting on these individuals, focusing entirely on the West Memphis Three from the start.\n",

      "John Mark Byers\n",
      "\n",
      "The HBO documentary, Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills, aired in 1996 ignited an uproar of controversy over the incarceration of the West Memphis Three. With some speculating the adoptive father of Christopher Byers, John Mark Byers was implicated in the murders. When filming this documentary John Mark Byers gave a folding hunting knife to filmmakers, Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sonofsky, suspecting there was blood on it, HBO executives ordered them to hand it over to police. Byers initially stated to have never used the knife, but later changed his claim to have used the knife one time to cut deer meat. Testing of the blood on the knife showed to be consistent with Christopher Byers, as well as John Mark Byers, even though they were not biologically related.  An alleged bite mark can be visible on the face of Stevie Branch that was not noted in the original autopsy or mentioned at the trials. Damien, Jessie, and Jason following their conviction. All submitted their teeth implants to be compared to the mark on Stevie’s face. Their teeth imprints did not match the alleged bite mark. John Mark Byers removed his teeth before an imprint could be made, citing his periodontal disease from taking seizure medications. In another HBO documentary, Paradise Lost 2: Revelation’s, an expert examined the autopsy photos and claimed it was possible to be a belt buckle imprint. Byers said to police he had spanked Chris with a belt at around 5:30 pm the night he was killed. \n",

      "Terry Hobbs\n",
      "\n",
      "Natalie Maines, Lead Singer of the Dixie Chicks and Advocate for the exoneration of the West Memphis Three, vocalized her support for new DNA and forensic testing to be done on this case while strongly suggesting if such testing was done, Terry Hobbs, the stepfather of Stevie Branch, would be implicated in the death of his own step-son. Following these allegations Terry sued the dixie chicks for defamation, opening himself to questioning under oath about the murders of Stevie, Michael, and Christopher. Terry under oath claimed to be a non-violent individual, despite reports of him beating his wife, Pam Hobbs, and shooting his wife’s brother-in-law. He also claimed to have not seen the boys at all the night they were murdered.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2010, Jamie Clark Ballard came forward with claims to have seen the boys on the night of May 5th, around 6:30 pm. She recalls them zooming on their bikes and yelled out to Christopher to go home, with Christopher yelling back” I don’t have to do what you tell me to do”, after this she allegedly saw Terry Hobbs hollering for Stevie. Police never came by to interview them even though she lived just 3 doors down. She wasn’t aware of Terry's claims to have not seen the children that day. \n",
      "\n",
      "DNA testing was done in 2007 none of which matched Damien, Jason, or Jessie. A hair that was found tied in one of the ligatures knots used to Michael Moore was found to be consistent with Terry. \n",
      "\n",
      "John Douglas a retired FBI Profiler said “The person responsible for this crime knew these victims, and knew them relatively well. We’re looking at someone who has been violent in the past, who’s violent now and at the time the crime was perpetrated and would also be violent in the future\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The Oxygen Docuseries, The Forgotten West Memphis Three, hosted by podcaster Bob Ruff reinvestigates the case focusing on possible suspects. He conducts an experiment in the river bed the boys were found in, trying to determine if maybe turtles or creatures in the water caused the lacerations to the boy's bodies. He placed raw chickens in the water and within minutes turtles began snapping at the chickens destroying almost all of it. Meaning turtles could have played a role in the lacerations, scratches, and removal of Chris’ scrotum. An expert who examined autopsy photos of the bodies theorized the majority of their trauma could have occurred post mortem while they lay in the river bed. \n",

      "The murder or murderers of Steven Branch, Michael Moore, and Christopher Byers are still at large, and need to be brought to justice.\n",

      "LEAVING THESE INDIANS, we proceeded to the next village, where another novel custom commenced: Those who accompanied us plundered our hospitable new hosts and ransacked their huts, leaving nothing. We watched this with deep concern but were in no position to do anything about it; so for the present had to bear with it until such time as we might gain greater authority. Those who had lost their possessions, seeing our dejection, tried to console us. They said they were so honored to have us that their property was well bestowed--and that they would get repaid by others farther on, who were very rich.\n",
      "\n",
      "All through the day's travel we had been badly hampered by the hordes of Indians following us. We could not have escaped if we had tried, they pursued so closely just to touch us. Their insistence on this privilege cost us three hours in going through them so they might depart. Next day, all the inhabitants of the newly reached village came before us. The majority had one clouded eye and others were completely blind, to our astonishment. They are a people of fine forms, pleasant features, and whiter than any of the nations we had so far seen.\n",

      "Here we began to see mountains. They seemed to sweep in succession from the North Sea and, from what the Indians told us, we believe they rise fifteen leagues from the sea. [The mountains which came in view on the high plains between the Concho and the Pecos were the Davis, Lower Guadalupe, and Upper Guadalupe ranges, which sweep toward the Gulf, which in the 16th century was referred to as the North Sea; it was anyway an extension of the Atlantic, which was the North Sea to Balboa on the Isthmus of Panama, in relation to the Pacific, or South Sea. Cabeza de Vaca may have meant \"toward\" when he said \"from\"; he may even have viewed them as sweeping northward; or he may have believed, like many later explorers, that a sea lay a short distance north in the middle of the continent.]\n",

      "We headed towards these mountains, with our newest hosts, who were willing to guide us by way of a related settlement but by no means to risk letting their enemies get in on this great good which they thought we represented. They plundered their relatives as though they were enemies when we arrived, but the people there knew the custom and had hidden some things which, after welcoming us with a festive demonstration, they brought out and presented us: beads, ochre, and some little bags of mica. Following custom, we handed them over to the plundering Indians who came with us, who thereupon resumed their dances and festivities and sent to a nearby village so their relatives there could come see us.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latter showed up that afternoon, bringing us beads, bows, and other trifles, which we also distributed. As we were about to get on next morning, the local villagers all wanted to take us to friends of theirs who lived at the top of the ridge; many houses stood there and the residents would give us various things, they said. But it was out of our way and we decided to continue our course on the same trail along the plain toward the mountains, which we believed close to the coast where people are mean. Having found the people of the interior better off and milder toward us, we preferred to bear inland. We also felt surer of finding the interior more populous and more amply provisioned. [The Spaniards evidently thought they had been traveling roughly parallel to the coast and veered northwestward in order to keep clear of such people as had enslaved them. As Hallenbeck points out, Pineda's map could have misled them because it puts Matagorda Bay where the Mississippi ought to be.] We further chose this course to find out more about the country so that, should God our Lord please to lead any of us to the land of Christians, we might carry information of it with us. [The reason that continuing along the same trail would be to veer \"inland\" is that here it ran into and along the Pecos River.]\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Indians saw our determination to keep to this course, they warned us that we would find nobody, nor prickly pears or anything else to eat, and begged us to delay at least that day; so we did. They promptly sent two of their number to seek people along the trail ahead. We left next morning, taking several Indians with us. The women carried water [for the saline Pecos is undrinkable], and such was our authority that none dared drink but by our leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two leagues out, we met those who had scouted ahead. They said they had found no one; which news seemed to dishearten our escort, who again pleaded with us to go by way of the mountains. When they saw we would not be swayed, they regretfully left us and returned down the river to their huts, while we ascended alongside it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not long afterward we came upon two women bearing burdens, which they set down when they saw us and offered some of what they carried. It was cornmeal! [Doubtless it was an item of commerce originating among pueblo Indians 250 or 300 miles distant; though it is possible that some of these semi-migrant plains Indians cultivated small corn plots the Spaniards never saw.] They told us that farther up that river we would find not only dwellings but plenty of prickly pears and meal. We bade them adiós; they were on their way to those we had just left.\n",
      "\n",
      "We walked till sunset, when we reached a ranchería [or temporary encampment, as Hallenbeck defines it] of some twenty houses. The inhabitants received us with weeping and grieving; for they knew that wherever we came would be plundered by those escorting us. When they saw we were unescorted, they got over their apprehension and gave us prickly pears, though nothing more. We stayed overnight.\n",
      "\n",
      "At dawn, the Indians we had left the day before surprised our latest hosts who, having neglected to conceal anything, lost all they had and shed copious tears. Their plunderers told them in consolation that we were children of the sun with power to save or destroy, along with even bigger lies, which none can tell better than they. They cautioned our hosts to avoid offending us in any way, to give us all they had [left], and to take us to a populous village which custom privileged them to pillage. Then the plunderers went back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking good heed, our new hosts began to treat us with the same awe and deference the others had shown. We traveled with them three days to a large settlement. Before we got there, our escort transmitted to the residents what they had recently heard, with much embroidery; for these people are fond of romance and make great liars, especially where they have a vested interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we approached the houses, therefore, the residents rushed out to receive us royally. Among other articles, two of their medicine-men gave us two gourds, which we ever after carried with us, to the enhancement of the Indians' reverence of us. Our escort duly sacked the houses but, being few and their victims many, they had to abandon more than half of what they took as more than they could carry.\n",

      "Hi I'm here with Grant Samuelson, who's the Associate Director of the John Hope Franklin Humanities Institute, and-- if I may say so editorially-- one of the smartest people I know: an expert in avant garde music, art, modernist design and many, many other things. And we're going to ask him the same question we've been asking everybody: who's your favorite teacher and why?\n",
      "\n",
      "[Grant]\n",
      "Well, it's a great question because I think about this guy frequently. A little bit of preamble, because there's something that has some life circumstances that factor in; I'll be brief. In the 60's, when middle class families could afford to buy a house in the area that I grew up in, which is the north shore of Chicago, my family moved from Logan Square to a tiny house-- I used to call it post-G.I. Bill housing-- in Glencoe, Illinois, in the New Tier School District-- which, when I went to high school eventually it was ranked, I guess, the best public high school in the country. So anyway things got messy; as the suburb got richer, we got poorer. Somehow, though, thanks to my mother's hard work we were able to keep the house and stay in the school district, which was our goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "So that factors into the way that I encountered this gentleman. My first day of my freshman year in high school, I had registered for a class called \"Film Making\". My high school was set up like a small college: they had a vibrant art program, massive theatre program-- Lili Taylor went there, for example-- and we were very blessed and very lucky with all these facilities and programs. I had chosen film making because my father, in the 60's and 70's, had worked for an educational film distributor. So I was aware of things like the National Film Board of Canada productions. So I was vaguely aware that there was this thing called avant garde film. And the class at New Trier seemed intriguing, for that reason. I had some sense that this was going be about both art and something that I knew a little bit about.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the first day of class, myself and some friends of mine walked in and encountered a gentleman named Richard Olderman. He introduced himself-- we called him Dick for 3 more years-- he was the only teacher we referred to by first name in high school. Kind of an aging hippie filmmaker himself. He had, in fact, known folks like Stan Brakhage, and was also teaching film at an art center down the road a little bit, closer to Chicago. Amusician; kind of a polymath. Within 10 minutes of the beginning of that first class, on my first day of freshman year, we were watching Stan Brakhage's \"Mothlight\". Later on in that class session, we watched Kenneth Anger's \"Kustom Kar Kommandos\" and \"Rabbit's Moon\".\n",
      "\n",
      "[Professor Davidson]\n",
      "This is not a typical ICP.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Grant]\n",
      "Not a typical ICP. And the reason for the preamble earlier was to illustrate how lucky and blessed I feel to have been able to stay in that school district and encounter this guy. And, right at that moment, I knew that it was one of those moments where you know that there's something that you don't know about that looks really interesting and you want to know more about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, we, my friend, a couple of friends and I stayed with him in that class for about 3 more years before he left the school, and ended up with a teacher in the fourth year, who was well meaning but not as interesting or intense and gave us-- myself and my friends-- a bit of a benchmark for comparison. At that point, we understood really how unique this guy was: as a teacher, as an artist, as someone who introduced us-- or could introduce us-- to really other worlds, literally: film making-- personal and aesthetic; artistic and intellectual. But I think that the most important thing I got from Dick Ol' was the sense that art could be a form of critique: that art is not just about things that were beautiful and transformative in that way-- which, as a 13 or 14-year-old, I was aware of to some extent-- but that art could confront; that art could infiltrate, confront, and change. And I think of Dick Olderman probably once a week, and I'm in my late 40's. I've not seen him since 1984, but he made an indelible impression on my life, and I think something that I literally follow, or rather a path that I literally follow every day.\n",

I loved Mrs. Jumper, my 4th grade teacher, gave me a love of math. I love Reno-- Bev Reno-- which was one of my professors at Northern Kentucky University Nursing School, who taught me the love of caring for other people, helping people to die with dignity or to help them become better, \"vested in their care\" kind of thing. And I'm giving a shout out to my niece. She's Mrs. Christy ?-Rhodes. She loves music and she's teaching a whole next generation a love of music.

      "[Interviewee]\n",
      "Well you know, nursing is a whole different ball of wax.

      "[Interviewee]\n",
      "Absolutely, we do that. Especially with our new grads, like when you're a preceptor or when an experienced nurse has a new grad or a role transition-- in the state of Kentucky, we have role transitions before you graduate-- and yes. You see one, they do one, and then they are qualified in order to do that skill. Absolutely.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Casey]\n",
      "And do you think that's a good method?\n",
      "\n",

      "[Casey]\n",
      "So, tell me about your favorite teacher, or learning experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Interviewee]\n",
      "Sure. It'd be my pleasure. My favorite teacher were actually students. You know, I've spent my entire teaching career of over 40 years working in education, and I've always had the benefit of being around young people; of course, being a student at one point and then being an educator. So, again, my favorite teachers were always the students. Whether they were my years in the classroom, or when I became a professional working in a field and the students became the teachers. And I think it was a great opportunity to experience that, especially in a classroom that wasn't a traditional classroom, but it was more focused on social emotional learning. So, I believe strongly in that concept. Academics are important, too, but I think the areas of character education; character learning; service learning; that type of thing is critical to the educational experience as anything else. And from what people experience, whether they're students or other young people, you know, that's the life experience that they bring to an education, and it really rounds it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, teachers can be great facilitators, making sure that opportunity takes place in a classroom, as well as outside of a classroom. You know, learning doesn't just happen in the four walls from 8:00 in the morning until 4 in the afternoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Casey]\n",
      "Great. So tell me a little bit more about social and emotional learning. What it is and why you're so passionate about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Interviewee]\n",
      "Sure. Well, again, working with typical kids is one thing, but again, my career has been spent working with special needs young people. So, the traditional learning-- the academics-- don't always register, and you're always looking for ways that are going to be more creative, ways that they can relate to techniques and strategies that will resonate and kind of stick to the wall for them. So, the social emotional learning is making experiences in a classroom and outside of a classroom kind of come to life. So using real life opportunities for service learning is an example. Kind of like community service: it's a great idea to go out and clean up a park or to collect cans of soup for homeless shelters and that sort of thing, but it's another thing when you are learning about the reasons why you do something like that and then implement it and then come back to the classroom and reflect about it; talk about it; and do journals. Or do something like what you're doing: video documentations, or writing a blog, or putting a student newspaper together, doing a school assembly, talking about the experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "So that's really how learning takes place. You know, not that there's anything wrong with learning from a book or going to a website. But the hands-on approach is something that, again, our students in special needs education really related to. And it's always best when you have it as an inclusive setting, where children with and without disabilities are working together in the same situation. And they're sort of co-creating the opportunities to learn, and are working together as peers. So, again, watching the children in that capacity, they've been my best teachers.\n",

So my dad's a physics educator, so I always asked questions and they were always answered, which was pretty cool.

He only saw a sad mistake of his choices, cast in front of him were his regrets, the choices he wished he could change. He watched his friends all sacrifice in great vain, Helieus and Ellmondis were likely gone.

      "The history of our link-building strategy: how it started, evolved, and eventually spun out of control.\n",
      "The story of how we approached the problem of identifying and removing problematic links from the Internet and got back on Google.\n",
      "The Story of the Rap Genius Blog FamilyIn the beginning (back in 2009, when it was just a few friends), we’d email sites like Nah Right, HipHopDX, Rap Radar, and NYMag and beg them to feature stuff like well-annotated songs, the Rap Map, etc. In this, we had minimal success.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the next couple years, the site and the community of annotators grew. Many of our contributors had music blogs, and some would link to Rap Genius pages when mentioning tracks in their posts. Our social media presence grew, and we made friends on Twitter with a handful of music bloggers.\n",
      "\n",
      "So at this point, our blog family was just a series of blogs, many of which belonged to site contributors, whose content and tone aligned well with Rap Genius. They linked our song pages in relevant posts, and we helped promote their blogs. The spirit of this was broader than a quid-pro-quo link exchange – the bloggers linked to us because their readers were interested in our lyrics and annotations, not just because they wanted to help us. We plugged them because they had good, tweet-worthy blog posts, not just because we appreciated their help with promotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we grew, our blog family began to get fancy. We began collaborations with major publications – including TheGrio, Esquire, Huffington Post, and The Atlantic – where they would ask us to write reviews and op-ed pieces on their sites. This was fun because it was a chance to promote Rap Genius to bigger audiences, and, since the publications liked it when we linked to interesting Rap Genius content (top lines, top songs, etc), it also helped our search rankings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the time the links from our blog family and these guest posts were organically woven into the text. For example (with Rap Genius links highlighted):\n",
      "\n",
      "Other times we would link an album’s entire tracklist at the bottom of a post, and we encouraged other bloggers to do the same. Eventually we made it very easy for bloggers to grab the links for a whole album by adding an “embed” button to our album pages. This produced posts that look like this:\n",
      "This is a blog post about Reasonable Doubt, with the full tracklist linked below. This definitely looks less natural, but at the time we didn’t think we were breaking Google’s rules because:\n",
      "\n",
      "The links were to relevant pages with good content.\n",
      "The bloggers were into the links and their readers liked Rap Genius.\n",
      "We thought Google penalized you a bit for backlinks that are clumped like this. I.e., we thought posts like this were worse for SEO than those with links woven into the text, but still not against the rules.\n",
      "These links’ anchor text (“Artist name – Song name lyrics”) was optimized to be sure, but they were also accurate descriptions of the linked content.\n",
      "This takes us up to the past couple months, when we did two things that were more or less totally debauched:\n",
      "\n",
      "On guest posts, we appended lists of song links (often tracklists of popular new albums) that were sometimes completely unrelated to the music that was the subject of the post.\n",
      "We offered to promote any blog whose owner linked to an album on Rap Genius in any post regardless of its content. This practice led to posts like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This last one triggered the controversy that caused Google to blacklist us. It started when John Marbach wrote to Mahbod to ask him about the details of the “Rap Genius blog affiliate program” (a recent Mahbod coinage):\n",
      "\n",
      "Mahbod wrote back, and without asking what kind of blog John had or anything about the content of the post he intended to write, gave him the HTML of the tracklist of Bieber’s new album and asked him to link it. In return, he offered to tweet exactly what John wanted and promised “MASSIVE traffic” to his site.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dubious-sounding “Rap Genius blog affiliate program”, the self-parodic used car salesman tone of the email to John, the lack of any discretion in the targeting of a partner – this all looked really bad.

      "How did we get back on Google?Google’s manual action had the reason “Unnatural links to your site”, which they explain as “a pattern of unnatural artificial, deceptive, or manipulative links pointing to your site.” Google recommends a 4-step approach to fixing the problem:\n",
      "\n",
      "Download a list of links to your site from Webmaster Tools.\n",
      "Check this list for any links that violate our guidelines on linking.\n",
      "For any links that violate our guidelines, contact the webmaster of that site and ask that they either remove the links or prevent them from passing PageRank, such as by adding a rel=\"nofollow\" attribute.\n",
      "Use the Disavow links tool in Webmaster Tools to disavow any links you were unable to get removed.\n",
      "So that morning we dug in.\n",
      "\n",
      "First we assembled the biggest list of inbound Rap Genius links we could get our hands on. We did this by combining the list of “links to your site” from Webmaster Tools that Google recommends with the list of inbound links you can download from Moz link search tool Open Site Explorer. After some cleaning and de-duping, we ended up with a master list of 177,781 URLs that contained inbound links to Rap Genius.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now we had to find out which of these URLs contained Rap Genius links that Google considered unnatural. The obvious place to start was the URLs associated with publications that we had promoted via Twitter or otherwise had relationships with. So we compiled a list of 100 “potentially problematic domains” and filtered the master list of 178k URLs that contained Rap Genius links to a new list of 3,333 URLs that contained inbound Rap Genius links and were hosted on one of our “potentially problematic domains\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Next we manually examined each of these 3,333 URLs and categorized each one based on whether it contained unnatural links.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are the groupings and counts we came up with:\n",
      "\n",
      "Group 1: Contains no links or already counted in another group. These we discarded. (1,791 pages)\n",
      "Group 2: Contains links organically woven into the text (1,294 pages)\n",
      "Group 3: Contains relevant structured link lists (169 pages)\n",
      "Group 4: Contains irrelevant structured link lists (129 pages)\n",
      "The URLs in Group 4 obviously had to go, but we decided to remove the links on the Group 3 URLs as well just to be safe. So we started emailing bloggers and asking them to take down links.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a good start, but we wanted to catch everything. There had to be a better way! Enter the scraper.\n",
      "The ScraperTo be completely thorough, we needed a way to examine every single URL in the master list of 178k linking URLs for evidence of unnatural links so we could get them removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we wrote a scraper to download each of the 178k URLs, parse the HTML and rank them by “suspiciousness”, which was calculated from:\n",
      "\n",
      "The total number of Rap Genius song page links the URL contained (more links is more suspicious)\n",
      "How many of those links contained “ Lyrics” (standardized anchor text is more suspicious)\n",
      "Whether the links were in a “clump” (i.e., 2 or more links separated by either nothing or whitespace)\n",
      "Then we visited and categorized the most suspicious URLs by hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Calculating suspiciousness for an individual URL is relatively straightforward with Nokogiri, but downloading all the URLs is more challenging. How did we do it?\n",
      "Technical Digression: How to scrape 178k URLs in Ruby in less than 15 minutesOk, so you have 178k URLs in a postgres database table. You need to scrape and analyze all of them and write the analysis back to the database. Then, once everything’s done, generate a CSV from the scraped data.\n",
      "The naive approachOpen-uri is probably the easiest way to download a URL in Ruby:\n",
      "require 'open-uri'\n",
      "\n",
      "urls.each do |url|\n",
      "  analyze_response(open(url).read)\n",
      "end\n",
      "But downloading and analyzing 178k URLs one at a time would take days – how do we make it faster?\n",
      "ConcurrencyTo make this faster we need a way to download multiple URLs simultaneously: Ruby threads. So let’s create a bunch of threads to simultaneously grab URLs from a queue and download them. Something like this:\n",
      "require 'open-uri'\n",
      "require 'thread'\n",
      "\n",
      "queue, processed = Queue.new, Queue.new\n",
      "urls.each { |u| queue << u }\n",
      "\n",
      "concurrency = 200\n",
      "\n",
      "concurrency.times do\n",
      "  Thread.new { processed << open(queue.pop).read until queue.empty? }\n",
      "end\n",
      "\n",
      "urls.length.times { analyze_response(processed.pop) }But this is verbose and writing concurrent code can be quite confusing. A better idea is to use Typhoeus, which abstracts away the thread handling logic behind a simple, callback-based API. Here’s the functionality of the code above implemented using Typhoeus:\n",
      "hydra = Typhoeus::Hydra.new(max_concurrency: 200)\n",
      "\n",
      "urls.each do |url|\n",
      "  hydra.queue(request = Typhoeus::Request.new(url))\n",
      "\n",
      "  request.on_complete do |response|\n",
      "    analyze_response(response.body)\n",
      "  end\n",
      "end\n",
      "\n",
      "hydra.run\n",
      "Now we can download 200 pages at once – nice! But even at this rate it still takes over 3 hours to scrape all 178k URLs. Can we make it faster?\n",
      "Even More ConcurrencyThe naive way to make this faster is to turn up Typhoeus’s concurrency level past 200. But as Typhoeus’s documentation warns, doing this causes things to “get flakey” – your program can only do so many things at once before it runs out of memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, though turning up Typhoeus’s concurrency would increase parallelization in downloading the URLs (since this is IO-bound), the processing of each response is CPU-bound and therefore cannot be effectively parallelized within a single MRI Ruby process.\n",
      "\n",
      "So to achieve more parallelism we need more memory and CPU power – what if we could get 100 machines each downloading 200 URLs at a time by running their own version of the program?\n",
      "\n",
      "Sounds like the perfect job for Amazon EC2. But configuring, spinning up, and coordinating a bunch of EC2 nodes is annoying and you have to write a bunch of boilerplate code to get it going. If only there were a way to abstract away the underlying virtual machines and instead only think about executing 100 simultaneous processes. Fortunately Heroku does exactly this!\n",
      "\n",
      "People think of Heroku as a platform for web applications, but it’s pretty easy to hack it to run a work queue application like ours. All you have to do is put your app into maintenance mode, scale your web dynos to 0, edit your Procfile, and spin up some worker processes. So we added the smallest database that supports 100 simultaneous connections, spun up 100 workers, and started scraping.\n",

      "Now we had 100 instances of the program running simultaneously, each of which was scraping 200 URLs at a time for a 4 order of magnitude improvement over our naive solution. But..\n",
      "How do we prevent workers from tripping over one another?This latest solution is highly performant, but that performance doesn’t come for free – we have to add additional logic to make the workers to work together. Specifically, we must ensure that every worker grabs its own URLs to scrape and that no 2 workers ever end up scraping the same URLs at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a number of approaches to keeping the workers out of each other’s way, but for simplicity we decided to do it all in the database. The idea is simple: when a worker wants to grab a new set of 200 URLs to scrape, it performs an update on the URLs table to lock each row it selects. Since each worker only tries to grab unlocked URL rows, no 2 workers will ever grab the same URL.\n",
      "\n",
      "We decided to implement this by borrowing some of the locking ideas from Delayed Job ActiveRecord:\n",
      "scope :not_locked, -> { where(locked_at: nil) }\n",
      "scope :unscraped, -> { where(fetched: false).not_locked }\n",

      "  db_time_now = connection.quote(Time.now.utc.to_s(:db))\n",
      "\n",
      "  find_by_sql <<-SQL\n",
      "    UPDATE urls SET locked_at = #{db_time_now}, updated_at = #{db_time_now}\n",
      "    WHERE id IN (#{urls_subquery})\n",
      "    RETURNING *\n",
      "  SQL\n",
      "end\n",
      "And that’s it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok fine, that’s not it – you still have to write logic to unlock URL records when a worker locks them but somehow dies before finishing scraping them. But after that you’re done!\n",
      "The ResultsWith our final approach – using 100 workers each of which scraped 200 URLs at a time – it took less than 15 minutes to scrape all 178k URLs. Not bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some numbers from the final run of scraping/parsing:\n",

      "End of technical digressionThe scraper produced great results – we discovered 590 more pages with structured linked lists and asked the relevant webmasters to remove the links.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the vast majority of the URLs the scraper uncovered were fundamentally different from the pages we had seen before. They contained structured lists of Rap Genius links, but were part of spammy aggregator / scraping sites that had scraped (sometimes en masse) the posts of the sites with whom we had relationships (and posts from Rap Genius itself).\n",
      "\n",
      "Generally Google doesn’t hold you responsible for unnatural inbound links outside of your control, so under normal circumstances we’d expect Google to simply ignore these spammy pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in this case, we had screwed up and wanted to be as proactive as possible. So we wrote another script to scrape WHOIS listings and pull down as many contact email addresses for these aggregation/scraping operations that we could find. We asked all the webmasters whose contact information we could find to remove the links.\n",
      "Disavowing links we couldn’t get removedWe were very successful in getting webmasters we knew to remove unnatural links. Most of these folks were friends of the site and were sad to see us disappear from Google.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, of the 286 potentially problematic URLs that we manually identified, 217 (more than 75 percent!) have already had all unnatural links purged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unsurprisingly we did not have as much success in getting the unnatural links flagged by our scraper removed. Most of these sites are super-spammy aggregators/scrapers that we can only assume have Dr. Robotnik-esque webmasters without access to email or human emotion. Since we couldn’t reach them in their mountain lairs, we had no choice but to disavow these URLs (and all remaining URLs containing unnatural links from our first batch) using Google’s disavowal tool.\n",
      "ConclusionWe hope this gives some insight into how Rap Genius did SEO and what went on behind the scenes while we were exiled from Google. Also, if you find your website removed from Google, we hope you find our process and tools helpful for getting back.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Google and our fans: we’re sorry for being such morons. We regret our foray into irrelevant unnatural linking. We’re focused on building the best site in the world for understanding lyrics, poetry, and prose and watching it naturally rise to the top of the search results.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Google is an extremely important part of helping people discover and navigate Rap Genius, we hope that this ordeal will make fans see that Rap Genius is more than a Google-access-only website. The only way to fully appreciate and benefit from Rap Genius is to sign up for an account and use Rap Genius – not as a substitute for Wikipedia or lyrics sites, but as a social network where curious and intelligent people gather to socialize and engage in close reading of text.\n",

Passengers who have never experienced this approach often murmur with increasing alarm as the 767-200 appears to be deliberately easing into a freezing bath at a ground speed of one hundred and fifty seven miles an hour. \n",

The flash is like a spark from an outlet, and the shoulder-fired rocket sweeps up to meet us before we touchdown.\n",
      "My friend Jake Hawkins tells me that this is unlikely.

The filter bags for the harness were lined with 100% compostable, environmentally friendly organic odor neutralizers.

      "I loved San Francisco when I had a little money in my pocket. But without at least a little, I spent a lot of sour time observing how the Mexican guys stacked flat cardboard boxes nine feet high in the back of their graffiti bright pickup while up the block a guy parallel parked his Maserati. Sure, any city was this way, but in the ramshackle movie set of San Francisco, there wasn’t enough room to keep disparities at dignified distances.\n",
      "Flying left me punchy and bone tired. Speeding underground between Mission & 16th and Mission & 24th, the BART train deafened passengers with a banshee howl and threatened all of us with imminent disintegration. At Civic Center the MUNI trains were locked in a staring contest with one another. A kid in a hoodie talked incessantly into his cell phone about how he was going to move back to New York. A lot of people were going back to New York, they just had to make sure everyone in San Francisco heard about it first.\n",
      "I abandoned the trains and busses and walked up Market toward home in the Western Addition. (NOPA is a restaurant, the Western Addition is a neighborhood.) Pious car choices nested like Russian dolls. A Prius, a Mini Cooper, and a Smart Car walk into a bar.\n",
      "Sprayed across a plywood wall protecting the open pit which would become a new high-rise in Hayes Valley, a graffiti kid had stenciled a skeletal horse vomiting blood. The blood spelled: GOD GAVE NEWSOM THE RAINBOW SIGN! NO MORE WATER! GENTRI-FIRE NEXT TIME!\n",

It smelled like my mother’s house.\n",
      "I seldom saw my roommates. Russ tended bar two blocks away and rarely showed up until three in the morning. Occasionally we would go on a bender and drink free with all of the other bartenders on shift who came in while Russ was working, and they were off. The first secret to surviving the city’s high cost of living was settling for a quarter of America’s median living standard. \n",
      "The second secret to surviving the city’s high cost of living? Create a network of friends in the service industry.\n",
      "My next roommate was a reedy kid named Petey, with full sleeve tattoos and a wild style mural inked earlobe to earlobe. He had escaped New Jersey, spoke of it like three tours in Vietnam, and worked in the Mission at an artisan irony store where they sold Hamm’s Beer, toasted and microwaved Velveeta and bacon sandwiches on Wonderbread, and sold “superfixie” bikes with wheels that did not turn.\n",
      "I do not mean these bikes lacked a freewheel. I mean the wheels were literally tack welded in place. The thing to do was hang them on the wall or sit on them near Dolores Park when you weren’t carrying them on your shoulder. This was a relatively new subculture war, and since I’ve wondered if it wasn’t the experiment of a hipster mockumentary or Urban Outfitters market research project. Petey’s job, as he described it to me once, smoking on our front steps, was to sound like he was from New Jersey, drink Hamm’s, and strenuously ignore people. Sagamore was Petey’s sandblasted dog, and so named because of a degenerative muscle condition which affected his head, causing the skin under his eyes and around his snout to hang like a stroke victim’s. He had once been named “Champion.”\n",
      "Proof the last roommate even existed came only from the periodic appearance of a low light under his door and the occasional calypso rhythm and spring moan of his bed frame thrashing the wall. Having paid cash outright for a year’s worth of rent, he received no mail, and was rumored to be called either Marcus or Brent, depending on who I talked with (Russ called him Brent, Petey called him Marcus). He was the best roommate you could hope for, assuming the severed head of a woman didn’t appear in the freezer one weekend. I put him on being a wealthy married guy from Marin who slummed in Western Addition bars for USF girls or boys, though Russ had never seen him out. Our unspoken agreement was not to pry, as his occupation of the largest room in the house kept the rest of our rents under $600 a piece.\n",
      "Money matters loomed.\n",
      "At the time of my father’s death\n",
      ", I temped at an internet porn company named Purv which specialized in the niche of industrial machine porn. They were the masters of mechanized fucking, the doctors of advanced dildonics, the mad laboratory of steampunked sex and electrostim labia clipping. Connoisseurs of Purv’s niche preferred zero male participation, and the girls were post-punk, vampire gothy, or wholesome farm girls with a thing for the combine. They enjoyed full health care benefits with no deductible, 100% match 401ks, and access to subsidized housing in Purv’s studio lofts four blocks away, provided they passed semi-regular drug tests and showed up when they said they would. I had heard that early on Purv offered fractional ownership in the videos, which meant that the girls pocketed a small royalty each time the content was resold. Save the camera crew, everyone else was temp or part-time, sans benefits.\n",
      "The building Purv purchased was south of Market Street in a foreboding ex-armory which still bore the black-and-yellow signs labeled FALLOUT SHELTER. The ground floor housed the reception area and a phalanx of typical tech-company cubicles and offices, connected in the back to a spacious machine shop. The top floors were post-production, web development, affiliate and web traffic management, accounting, technical support, and a dot-commish rec room packed with all of the amenities that flowed down Howard and Bryant at six cents on the dollar when the vaporware companies tanked. A freight elevator connected the machine shop to the studios below street level. Once in a while, you would see a new girl sitting in the reception area for an interview, but the working actresses steered clear of the upper floors, where our bored army spent most of their days processing hardcore images or dealing with the mundane cash flow details surrounding Purv’s enormous profits.\n",
      "Purv’s founders still took an active interest in the business, being passionistas themselves for the unity of woman and machine. Ray Vance was an old hippie machinist from Fresno and his partner, Collin Baker, was a Stanford MBA and tech startup burnout. \n",
      "They were frequently in the machine shop together, among the partially-assembled pneumatic pumps and small tool engines, fiddling with robotics and silicone molds, while the production assistants ran racks of the “business end” parts from the day’s shoots through commercial dishwashers and autoclaves.\n",
      "It smelled of acetylene and industrial lubricants and popcorn, as Ray Vance had an insatiable appetite for the buttery stuff, and kept a full-scale movie theatre popcorn machine stocked and running all day long. On last pass, an old-school chalk board displayed a sketch for what looked like a motorized wheelchair fitted with a black horse saddle and gynecologists stirrups. In the open lot behind the machine shop, a circle of wooden picnic tables allowed for lunch outside if you weren’t of a mind to sit in the coffin-plush rec room, which I often did. Short on cash, I was on the one-burrito-a-day diet. Coffee for breakfast, half a burrito for lunch, the other half for dinner. Ray Vance spotted me a bag of popcorn for my walk home.\n",
      "My specific job consisted of finalizing and uploading the videos to Purv’s websites, writing some of the video descriptions, and editing and partially censoring video stills for the teaser pages. Thankfully, we were all required to wear headphones, or else the top floor would have sounded like a great sapphic polyphonic orgy in a Detroit auto assembly line. After a couple of weeks, complete porn desensitization set in, and I barely registered what was going on in the videos. I was, however, increasingly perplexed by how to wittily describe, for the nine hundredth time, the intersection of Black & Decker, synthetic appendages, and wax-bald vaginas. The cubicle I inherited was peppered with cheat-sheets of nouns, verbs, and adjectives tacked up behind the monitor to make the copywriting easier.\n",
      "A web page on the Purv intranet helped the temp web monkeys like myself keep the machine names straight. It showed each machine with a brief video clip, so that we would never accidentally disappoint our loyal following by calling a machine by the wrong name. We were reminded constantly to refer to it. In a company-wide email one morning, Collin Baker underscored the importance of accuracy by sharing a “not uncommon” customer service email.\n",
      "The message customer service received was from 36-month member ($1,078.20) “BigOleBoi,” (Don Lemmon, 39-year-old regional bank manager in Tulsa, Oklahoma) calling attention to the fact that in video #278 (“Go On Down on the Funny Farm”) we had misrepresented “Licksaw’s” top-tongue speed at 3,000 CHM (clit-hits-per minute), when in video #112, (“Lumberjackin’ Time”) Licksaw’s control dial clearly indicated a maximum upper limit of 4,500 CHM. Could we please clear up this discrepancy?\n",
      "BigOleBoi was not alone in his attention to detail—the Purv forums were jammed with fans who carried the stats of the sex machines in their heads the way others knew the earned run and batting averages of major league ball players. The most active thread on the forum was one in which members regularly discussed what types of future robots could be added to the Purv family. Other members collaborated online over long, meticulous scripts for Ray Vance and Collin Baker to shoot. When Collin Baker once picked up the idea of issuing gasoline-scented limited edition collector’s cards, modeled after Topp’s baseball cards, the entire run of 500 sold out at $89.95 each. Rumor had it plans were underway for a massive live event to take place in an old Air Force hangar in Nevada, a project the members referred to as “Yearning Man.”\n",
      "So when I returned from Florida, head fogged in and body beat to hell by five hours in a center seat on Southwest, I accidentally made the mistake of labeling the robot in a new scene “Captain Fucktronic” when it was actually “The Dildonator.” The mistake generated nearly three hundred flaming all-caps or all-lowercase emails in the customer service department, two cubes to my right. \n",
      "It did not help matters that Captain Fucktronic and The Dildonator were major rivals in our continuing sci-fi miniseries, Warpdriver.\n",
      "Word reached the machine shop an hour later, and Collin Baker rounded up the entire support staff in the rec room for an emergency meeting. We filed in to find Ray Vance sitting in his oversized, stuffed purple chair, a prop ripped straight from a Dr. Seuss book. He looked dejected. Bits of popcorn nestled in his long salt and pepper beard. Collin Baker waited until the room was full and then stormed in for maximum dramatic effect, his shirtsleeves cuffed by equal centimeters to the elbows.\n",
      "Though both Vance and Baker had a genuine enthusiasm for Purv’s content, it’s worth noting that Ray Vance saw the enterprise as a labor of love and Collin Baker’s heart was closer to his wallet. Collin’s assistant dimmed the lights. An LCD projector descended from the ceiling. Collin stood beside Ray Vance, sad porn robot king, and pointed a remote at the laptop connected to the projector. A bright image of Captain Fucktronic and all of his weaponized appendages filled the wall.\n",
      "“People,” Collin began, “who is this?”\n",
      "“Captain Fucktronic,” we said in a dim, asynchronous chorus. Ray Vance turned his head and looked at the screen lovingly. The PowerPoint slide advanced. An action shot of The Dildonator appeared.\n",
      "“Very good. Now who is this?”\n",
      "“The Dildonator,” we said, a little more with it.\n",
      "“Wow, hey, that’s right. Gosh. It’s hard to understand how we managed to fuck up so bad today, seeing how you all clearly can tell the difference between the two.” Collin advanced the slide and both robots appeared side by side. “Just in case someone out there is not quite clear, let me point out a few of the more obvious differences.” Collin waved his laser pointer over the two robots in shaky circles. “Here? And here? Here? See?”\n",
      "We murmured assent.\n",
      "“Let me express this clearly: If anyone still doesn’t get it, we can arrange for a free first-hand experience with the two. I assure you the differences will be vivid.”\n",
      "The room was silent. Ray Vance sighed heavily.\n",
      "“It just bums me out, man,”\n",
      " he said in a low voice. “These are like… my kids.”\n",
      "Collin nodded vigorously.\n",
      "“You know who else it bums out?” Collin picked up. “Our paying members! You know, the ones with the credit cards?” The lights brightened and Collin closed his laptop with a snap.\n",
      "His body language softened, he hung his head like a disappointed father and squeezed Ray’s shoulder reassuringly.\n",
      "“Folks, never forget this: We are storytellers. This enterprise of ours—it’s about creating and maintaining the unbroken arc of a fantastic, magical ream. When we make mistakes, even smaller ones than this, the inconsistencies destroy the fantasy for our fans, and they are rudely blue balled by our sloppiness.”\n",
      "Two months hence, I would more or less hear the same speech from Pontius J. LaBar’s mouth in the boardroom of a Fortune 500 company.\n",
      "“This isn’t 1999. We’re not the only machine erotica shop in the game any more. Members have choices. We may be the first and the best, but we’re only the best because we’re customer service fanatics. Do I need to rent Tony Hsieh for an hour to cheer you fuckers up? Attention to detail, people. When we fail to uphold the high standards, members notice, and we lose market share.”\n",
      "“I remember the day they were born.” Ray Vance rescued an edible kernel in his beard and consoled himself.\n",
      "Collin Baker met each of our eyes, hands on hips. “You want to go through the motions, start filling out your apps for Starbucks. Dismissed.”\n",
      "We began our penguin waddle out. The idea of free coffee and working with fully clothed women in aprons was by this time far more arousing than another eight hours pixelating nipples a-la alligator clips.\n",
      "Then: “Nick, can we talk with you for a minute?”\n",
      "It was as if they read my thoughts.\n",
      "Ray Vance and Collin Baker freed me up to explore my barista options the very same day.\n",
      "You have not been thoroughly blacklisted from temporary employment until your agency finds out you were shit-canned from a porn company. They’d been notified prior to the meeting and hung up on me when I called to request a new assignment. A guy with biceps like grapefruits escorted me to the receptionist’s front desk. I remembered my half-eaten burrito in the rec-room fridge. Since I didn’t think Ray Vance would come charging out with a fare-thee-well bag of popcorn, I couldn’t leave the burrito behind. I pleaded with the security guy and he reluctantly disappeared back upstairs to fetch it for me.\n",
      "This was when I met Sadie Parrish.\n",
      "She was a loose limbed, straight red-haired beauty with a cosmic calm and twee librarian’s glasses above a bridge of light freckles. On her lap a copy of Circuit Cellar lay open. Her lips moved slightly as she read. I was instantly smitten.\n",
      "I blurted “You don’t want to work here.”\n",
      "She looked up and took me in. She squinted at me through her glasses. Her attention was like being shot to death with spring sunshine.\n",
      "“How do you know where I want to work?” She closed her magazine.\n",
      "“I don’t know where you want to work, but I know where you don’t want to work. And that would be here.”\n",
      "She closed her magazine. “Sounds like you might have a little problem with female empowerment, huh?”\n",
      "“Are you kidding? Tell me you’re kidding.”\n",
      "“Why would I be kidding?”\n",
      "“Let me see if I can put it another way: When was the last time you were double-penetrated by twin eight-inch dildos driven by a six-speed Chevy transmission?”\n",
      "When she looked away and laughed, I noticed the Apple logo tattooed on the back of her neck.\n",
      "“Is that how you ask all the girls out for coffee?”\n",
      "“Did I ask you to coffee?”\n",
      "“Maybe I asked me for you.”\n",
      "“And what did you say?”\n",
      "“I said yes.”\n",
      "“That’s pretty unusual.”\n",
      "She opened her magazine again.\n",
      "“I’m glad you asked. Your afternoon should be as free as mine.”\n",
      "“I’m not walking out on this interview. If you have all this new free time, wait for me.”\n",
      "“You should skip the interview. They won’t hire you with that tattoo on your neck. No logos, trademarks, or rights-managed characters or likenesses on the actresses. If you had one of those trashy tribal wingdings, no problem. But no logos. Post production would go out of their mind tracking and blurring it, and it would ruin it for the members anyway. Thing is, they won’t tell you that until after you’ve auditioned, know what I mean?”\n",
      "She bit her bottom lip and seemed genuinely deflated.\n",
      "“Fucked before I was fucked.”\n",
      "“Way of the world.”\n",
      "The security guard came back with my burrito and stood by the receptionist’s desk to see me out. Sadie looked as though she understood.\n",
      "“Alrighty then,” the security guy said. “Time to go.” He held the burrito at arm’s length like a full diaper. I took it.\n",
      "He held the door for me, a gesture of civility I owed to Sadie’s presence, I was sure. I stepped outside into the afternoon wind. She wasn’t standing yet, but she leaned over to look at me through the open door.\n",
      "“Soooo… I guess it’s coffee o’clock,” she said.\n",
      "I felt like I had to shout as the traffic crowded past.\n",
      "“I can’t afford to buy you a cup of coffee. But I can offer you half of a burrito.” I waggled my foil package in the air. She stood up and rolled her magazine as if to scold a dog. She stepped outside into that cold and descending light. The security guard shut the door, and we were among the homeless and the windblown garbage.\n",
      "“What if I loan you a cup of coffee?”\n",
      "“That’s sort of a relief. It was my last half burrito.”\n",
      "“Please, please shut up. You had me at double penetration.”\n",
      "Once in your life should you be so lucky to meet someone like this. Meet someone you start with in media res. Meet someone who seems as though they’ve known you for who you are your entire life. Meet someone improbably, and understand every meaningless moment guided you to this high-speed collision.\n",
      "The 49 Mission-Van Ness bus lumbered up from the curb and left us there with a poorly understood but shared secret. The fog crushed over the hills above South San Francisco. Take it all as a gift if it comes to you like this.\n",
      "I would offer one caveat, however: Before it comes, as Sadie Parrish appeared to me in Purv’s lobby, file a small prayer that the girl you meet has no ambitions to become the country’s first domestic suicide bomber. \n",
      "Because Sadie did, and who was I to dissuade her from a life’s ambition?\n",
      "Her older brother, Staff Sergeant Anthony Parrish, had been killed in Afghanistan, and the shockwave from his roadside bomb traveled all the way across the world and sheared her family into pieces. She was twenty-two and done with the yellow ribbons and oak trees. She didn’t tell me this the day I was fired from Purv. When a fresh tattoo of the Starbucks logo appeared on her stomach after one of my two week stints on the road, we had a talk.\n",
      "But that day of loaned coffee: I tramped home late, buzzing with the day, the reality of my financial situation settled on my shoulders. Little money remained. \n",
      "I could not subdivide my burrito into smaller and smaller sustaining portions.\n",
      " Laundry called. I batted the mound of clothes around, looking for jeans with spare cash tucked away, happy-hour style. I found none, but I did discover the invitation from LaBar Partners Limited crumpled at the bottom of my army green duffel. I sat alone on the edge of my bed and turned the unopened invitation in my hand.\n",

      "Song Lyric: Mario Kart racing game series is a staple in Nintendo's line-up of video games. This spin-off is a kind of its own. A Mario Kart game has appeared on many of Nintendo's systems since the SNES. Super Mario Kart was the first Mario Kart game ever released, and now we're at Mario Kart 8.\n",
      "Game ModesGrand PrixThere are two different versions of the Grand Prix the player can participate in. The Nitro Grand Prix and the Retro Grand Prix. The Nitro Grand Prix section of the Grand Prix contains sixteen brand new courses, where as the Retro one houses remastered courses from previous games. One has to beat a cup, starting from the Mushroom Cup or the Shell Cup, to unlock the next set of races. Each cup ups the difficulty of the rival racers and the courses get longer.\n",
      "Time TrialEvery Mario Kart game features a Time Trial mode. In this mode, players race through the set amount of laps for each course to achieve the fastest time of completion they can. Players usually start out with Triple Mushrooms. Time Trials in Mario Kart 8 can be shared online with other players and, like other gameplay, can be uploaded to YouTube. You can also try to be others time by racing their ghost. If you are to beat somebody's fastest time, you will receive a Miiverse sticker.\n",
      "Battle ModeThe verse mode in Mario Kart has changed significantly. Instead of being in an arena like place, your drive around on the same courses you race on in the Grand Prix. They have everything all the other races have in terms of items. The objective is the same, as you play to remove our opponents balloons through the use of damaging items.\n",
      "FeaturesAnti-GravityAnti-gravity is one of the newest features to the game and was best shown off. Through special parts of the race courses, your automobile will be able to ride along surfaces you usually would not be able to race on, such as the side of a building. It adds more to the game itself, as new strategies are awakened to maintain your position as the Mario Kart champion.\n",
      "Kart CustomizationKart customization is not a new feature, but improved and new to the home based console counterparts of Mario Kart. There are 36 different parts divided into 3 different categories; bodies, tires and gliders. Aside from looking cool and being a great way to show off what embodies you as a race, they actually serve to impact your kart stats. Whether is be to boost your speed at the expense of handling or sacrificing the strength of your mini-turbo to drive faster underwater and during anti-gravity, this is a key to victory.\n",
      "Interactive ObstaclesLike previous installments in the series, Mario Kart has interactive objects on the track that the races take place. From the Giant Egg on Yoshi Valley to the Goombas that parade on any and every track they can. The twist this time around is, in anti-gravity mode, when you hit another racer or certain objects, you spin around and you perform a short burst of speed.\n",

For all the SYCOPHANTS that thought Trubisky was gonna be what I call the, uh, the savior, the, you know, the Jesus Christ is gonna come back in to save the Bears...you saw your day of judgment, you NEOPHYTES! You’re a bunch of SYCOPHANTS that read, uh, what I call a foul. And to all those people that I’ve been telling you, for the last seven weeks, that Trubisky is go--never gonna give you a--a, uh, a win in--in--in--in Green Bay, and then alone not just Green Bay but any game, I--I proved it today...where I showed you over the last ten weeks, by calling your show specifically, is how INEPTITUDE the fact that your--your SYCOPHANT callers are the--the support Trubisky are complete outraged!! They’re deranged! Cause what did you see tonight? What did you see tonight, mister, uh, mister--mister GAME?? Mister Meller? What did you see tonight? You saw an INEPTITUDE quarterback that had two fumbles, and couldn’t complete a first down to save his life, and you have--you have the TEMERITY to talk about how great he is?? I saw--listen, you guys, I--I really like your station, but I’m--I’m gonna call your judgment card: if you don’t honestly come out after this call and talk about the flaws of Trubisky, I honestly question your integrity for the game. And going back to mister, uh, mister U of I, alright? I saw your game in 1990. I saw those games you played, okay? And lemme tell you something real quick mister 1990--uh--I think that you know exactly where the fall lies. And if you’re gonna tell me right now that Trubisky was somehow gonna be this magic bullet that was gonna make them somewhat superior, you’re DELUSIONAL! And I’ll tell you this right now, you are a complete FRAUD if you think the opposite! And I guarantee you, I will give you the analysts, and I’ll throw it down your THROAT! Because, what you saw tonight, was an embarrassing! Because in 1980, you SYCOPHANT, Vince Evans, won 67--61 to 7 because, you know why? He had a great offense, and then basically today, he was shown, basically, by Trubisky, how INEPTITUDE he was. So PLEASE! Gimme your--gimme your AWESOME feedback! Gimme your \\[inaudible\\] because you know why? I think that you two are, uh, a bunch of CLOWNS that don’t understand the analytics, and please give me SOME REASON to justify this wonderful what I call LOSS, because I’ve been telling you this, for what, seven weeks? Meller? You’re pretty smart, right? And the other guy, mister--mister U of I, the runner? I think you should really think about questioning--your judgment about--analyze the Bears because I find this to be an ABOMINATION and I think it’s EMBARRASSING and you guys are just SAD.\n",

      "You were, what?  One?  Maybe not even that.  Laying on the blanket next to your momma in the park, sleeping so peacefully as she watched over you with a tired but happy look on her face.  That sleep, so calm and serene…I envied you that.  I was having trouble sleeping even back then, and every day I could feel the last scraps of that kind of peace being taken from me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t want you to misunderstand me though.  Me talking about not sleeping and envying a little baby that can, well you might think that I was jealous of you.  Hated you even.  \n",
      "\n",
      "But no.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I saw that little pink ball of innocence, that bright little light of life that hadn’t been kicked and shit on by the world quite yet, and I loved you.  I loved you for what you were and what you could be.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I decided to take you under my wing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pa had once called me a witch.  A witch!  I tried to tell the dumb bastard that I wasn’t no witch, and even if I was, you’d call a boy witch a warlock.  But he got that mean, sour look he’d get sometimes before I was five words in, and I knew the hit was coming before he even started to swing.  I just balled up then.  I was fifteen at the time, and I might could have fought back, but he was bigger and stronger and meaner than me, and if I fought back, it’d just be worse.  So instead I balled right up like a lil’ armadillo, and before long it was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Armadillos are funny.  They look cute and all, sure.  Like little knights in suits of armor or something.  But you know, a lot of them have leprosy under that armor.  A poison rot like from the olden times right under their skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt like that back then.  Like I had poison welling up under that skin he was bruising and splitting.  Waiting for the right time to reach out and touch him.  Wither him right away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Except my poison wasn’t leprosy.  Mine was what I could see.  What I knew.  I could look at my father, big, strong man that he was, and I could see the thread of his life stretching out in front of him.  Not everything, you understand—it wasn’t til later that I got where I could focus more and see particulars I wanted to see—but enough to know the biggest goods and bads he had coming.  Enough to see when and how that thread would be cut for good.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was why he was afraid of me.  Why he hated me so.  I’d made the mistake of letting on what I could see before I knew it was better to hide it.  Pa tried to ignore it at first, but that changed when I came to him crying one morning.  Found him in the field working on that old tractor that crapped out at least once at season, already in an awful temper.  I should have known better, but I was scared and upset and I loved him.  I thought if I told him how he was going to die, he could avoid it, and I wanted that more than just about anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Funny thing was, when what I saw finally came true a few years later, the biggest thing I felt was relief.  Relief that it was over, and that my poison had finally finished the job.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know what you’re thinking.  I’m being arrogant.  Thinking I can play God.  Thinking that my visions are killing people when, just by listening to what I’ve said, you could tell I’m just seeing what’s coming for somebody, and even warning them doesn’t change a thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a long time, I thought that way too.  As I got older, and especially after Pa passed, I got stronger in what I could see, but I wanted to see it less and less.  I couldn’t help people, and seeing people that way—like a bunch of choices they hadn’t made yet—it made it hard to see them as people at all.  They were just numbers and symbols, and I felt like some egghead mathematician looking at some humongous formula on a blackboard.  Except I liked people and I hated math, and the world was getting so I couldn’t be around someone for more than a few minutes without seeing the worst things they would do and how it would all end.  I learned to block it some, but just enough that I didn’t go crazy.  And that was before I started losing sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "We aren’t meant to be in this world all the time.  I’m convinced of this.  This world…it’s a hard place with sharp edges, and it’ll whittle you down to nothing if you don’t leave it once in a while.  That’s why God gave us sleep.  And dreams.  Some people say that those dreams are as real as this world—realer even.  And maybe that’s so or maybe not.  I don’t know.  What I do know is that we aren’t meant to stay here all the time.  Especially when you see everything that I see.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I first saw that little baby you, I guess something came over me.  Maybe it was some instinct, some part of whatever this power is that I have.  I like to think that it was something more though.  That even then, I wanted to keep you safe forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "I spent the next hour looking through the thread of your life.  The times you were truly scared or truly happy.  The things that shaped you or pushed you this way or that.  When you felt loved and when you were in danger.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The day, when you were just nineteen, that you died.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time your momma picked you up and carried you back to the car, my head was splitting and I was close to bawling.   I could see how it happened and why, but not how to stop it.  Telling you, even if I waited eighteen years to tell you the day it happened, wouldn’t be enough to stop it.  Our lives, our fates, they have movement.  Inertia.  And you were heading toward a coffin like a bullet flying fast.  Me telling you stuff you wouldn’t believe too late to help anything…well, I might as well be puffing out a breath at that passing bullet.  It won’t change where it hits one little bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what if I didn’t talk to you just then?  What if I talked to you for years?  Proved to you that what I saw was real and that you could trust me?  Maybe that belief would be enough that you would listen when the time was right?\n",
      "\n",
      "I followed you and your momma home that day, and I’ve kept track of you ever since.  Those first few years, I would only see you every now and then.  Checking your thread for any changes, looking into more details so I could understand you better.  The rest of the time I spent doing my little experiments with other people, seeing if I could move their threads at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turns out I can, but it’s not an easy thing.  That momentum I was talking about?  It’s a powerful thing, and even if you warn someone or keep them from doing something they were meant to do, the universe has a funny way of…self-correcting.  I’ve seen odd stuff over the years, much of it I don’t understand, and the strangest thing has to be the way that Creation will bend over backwards to return a person to the path they’re meant to be on.  I’m talking about coincidences, or things that even go beyond that, that just seem to happen to make sure someone lives or dies, that they meet a particular person or learn a particular thing.  I don’t claim to get why it does what it does, but it didn’t take long for me to understand what it meant to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "This force, this momentum, whether you want to call it fate or destiny or magic elves in the trees, it was working against me and what I was trying to do.  It was the opposition.  The enemy.  The bad guy.  And for awhile, I didn’t know if I could beat it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then one day, I did.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a guy named Lenny.  Nice enough guy, I guess, but more importantly, he worked in the building across from my job and ate lunch outside most days.  It gave me easy access to him, and after a few months, I had most of his next twenty years mapped out in my head.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key to most of it was him meeting the woman he’d marry—Her name was Laura.  Before meeting her, his life was pretty bare.  He didn’t like himself, and because of that, he didn’t like most people.  Meeting her changed all of that.  I’m not saying their life together was perfect, because it wasn’t, but they brought out the best in each other.  I could see several points in his life where he picked right instead of left because of his love for her, and because of this, he avoided several traps the world might have thrown in his path.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at his life, I knew I’d found something special.  Everyone is affected by others, but to find a life so impacted by how it touches another…that’s a lot more rare.  And if I was ever going to have a chance of proving I could affect things, of saving you, this was it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, for a wonder, it worked.  It took time and effort and sacrifice, but it worked.  And from that, I came up with my plan to protect you.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m writing this two days before your twelfth birthday.  When you find this notebook, which I know you will, it will have a green notebook rubberbanded to it.  That is the story of your life from age twelve to thirteen.  It is long, but I tried to organize it well and only use words you’ll understand.  If you find one you don’t, go get the dictionary off your momma’s bookshelf and look it up.  You need to get all of this, okay?\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t cover everything, of course.  It would take way too long to write or read.  But it’s about thirty pages of little things and big things that are going to happen and what happens because of those things.  I give you the date and time when I can, but I can’t see that clear except occasional.  And there’s only as couple of times when I tell you what you should do instead of what you’re meant to do.  For now, I just want you to understand that what I’m telling you will come true and that you can trust me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every year I’m going to give you another green notebook.  It’ll tell you what you need to know.  When you need to pick path B instead of path A, that kind of thing.  I’ll keep watch on the road ahead of you, and make sure that you stay safe for as long as I’m able.  I’m convinced that if you listen to me, we can beat that day when you’re nineteen.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know this is a lot to understand and believe, but I’ve already seen that you will.  I can’t see your thread moving yet, but I think in time, as you know more and trust more, that’ll get easier.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I know you’re a smart girl, so this probably doesn’t need to be said, but don’t tell anyone about these notebooks or what you know.  Take it from me, all it will do is make people think you’re crazy or that you’re wrong somehow.  Just keep it for yourself and use it as you will.  It’s still your life, after all.  I’m just here to make sure you get to live it.\n",
      "\n",

      "*That is the end of the primary writing in the red notebook.  There is, however, loose paper in the back of the notebook that appears to be from a different source, as the lines are different in size and spacing.

      "\n",
      "**** \n",
      "\n",
      "I used to think of people as strings.  Seeing how inevitable everything was, it always felt like we were all being pulled along, just a dumb piece of string, until we finally get cut.  But then I met Lenny and the others, and I realized that I could change that string if I worked hard enough.  Twist it this way or that, lengthen it or cut it shorter than intended.  It made me feel special, powerful even, but more importantly, it meant that I could guide you through a safe and happy life.\n",
      "\n",
      "For years it worked.  I got you past you suffocating at nineteen, and then past the two times the universe tried to “self-correct” over the next few months.  And when I saw you headed toward that fire at thirty, I stopped it from ever happening at all.  I wrapped your life in bubble wrap and I think you used to appreciate it.  I know you did.\n",
      "\n",
      "But lately…you take it all for granted.  You think that I’m manipulating you somehow or that you don’t need me anymore.  You have no idea of the vicious things the world has waiting for you at every turn, of how many times I’ve fought those things off for you.  You have no idea of how things will change if you keep ignoring my advice like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing is, you’re wrong.  It’s always been your choice.  I used to not believe in free will, but I was wrong.  I see that now.  You can steer your life how you want, but make no mistake, free will does not mean you won’t be pushed and pulled.  That universe that’s been wanting to hurt and kill you all these years, its just waiting for the chance to put you back on its course—some version of things where you’re miserable or scared or dead.  And left to your own devices, you’ll steer right into it.  I can see that now.  And the worse part of it is, I’m no different than you.\n",
      "\n",
      "I never told you why I don’t sleep much.  It’s because of the nightmare.  The same nightmare I’ve had for nearly forty years.  It’s always terrified me, though when I was younger, I thought it was just a dream.  Even when I recognized you in it, I told myself it was just my brain’s way of expressing my fear that I might fail you some day.  It wasn’t until the last few years that I’ve come to accept that the dream is the rapidly approaching future, or at least one version of what may come to pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "In it, you’re in a large room with no windows and soundproofing on the walls.  You’re laying in bed asleep, though the IV running into your arm makes me think you have little choice in that.  Three years ago, I didn’t know where that place was or what drugs I was feeding you.  Now, I own that place and have enough medical supplies stockpiled to last ten years or more.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s not fate, not really.  I saw those choices, but I still chose to make them.  I could say it’s all out of my hands, but I love you too much to lie.  No, the truth is better.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the truth is…well, part of the truth is that I’ve run out of options to keep you safe.  For all my planning and advice, all my study of the story of you, you’re still the author, and when you decide to refuse my help, I have to make a choice to either leave you to make your own mistakes or take control of things once and for all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know you want me to just leave you alone, and while that hurts, I guess I understand it too.  No one wants to be bossed around or feel like their life isn’t their own.  But you have to understand, I feel the same way.  I didn’t ask for this power.  I never wanted to see what I do.  The dark, secret hearts of people.  The sharp, biting teeth of the world.  The same damned dream that is so terrible and so wonderful at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because you’re not alone in that room.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is another bed, and on it, I lay sleeping.  This isn’t the ragged, sweaty, screaming sleep of a man ripping himself from a nightmare only to be plunged back into the too-sharp world.  No.  My breath is even.  My face unlined by worry or fear.  I’m not drugged or knocked out, either.

      "Song Lyric: Orientation games began the day I arrived at Yale from Baltimore. In my group we played heady, frustrating games for smart people. One game appeared to be charades reinterpreted by existentialists; another involved listening to rocks. Then a freshman counsellor made everyone play Trust. The idea was that if you had the faith to fall backward and wait for four scrawny former high-school geniuses to catch you, just before your head cracked on the slate sidewalk, then you might learn to trust your fellow-students. Russian roulette sounded like a better game.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No way,” I said. The white boys were waiting for me to fall, holding their arms out for me, sincerely, gallantly. “No fucking way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's all cool, it's all cool,” the counsellor said. Her hair was a shade of blond I'd seen only on Playboy covers, and she raised her hands as though backing away from a growling dog. “Sister,” she said, in an I'm-down-with-the-struggle voice, “you don't have to play this game. As a person of color, you shouldn't have to fit into any white, patriarchal system.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I said, “It's a bit too late for that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the next game, all I had to do was wait in a circle until it was my turn to say what inanimate object I wanted to be. One guy said he'd like to be a gadfly, like Socrates. “Stop me if I wax Platonic,” he said. The girl next to him was eating a rice cake. She wanted to be the Earth, she said. Earth with a capital “E.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was one other black person in the circle. He wore an Exeter T-shirt and his overly elastic expressions resembled a series of facial exercises. At the end of each person's turn, he smiled and bobbed his head with unfettered enthusiasm. “Oh, that was good,” he said, as if the game were an experiment he'd set up and the results were turning out better than he'd expected. “Good, good, good!”\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was my turn I said, “My name is Dina, and if I had to be any object, I guess I'd be a revolver.” The sunlight dulled as if on cue. Clouds passed rapidly overhead, presaging rain. I don't know why I said it. Until that moment I'd been good in all the ways that were meant to matter. I was an honor-roll student—though I'd learned long ago not to mention it in the part of Baltimore where I lived. Suddenly I was hard-bitten and recalcitrant, the kind of kid who took pleasure in sticking pins into cats; the kind who chased down smart kids to spray them with mace.\n",

      "“Well,” I said, “maybe I meant it at the time.” I quickly saw that that was not the answer she wanted. “I don't know. I think it's the architecture.”\n",

      "Through the dimming light of the dean's-office window, I could see the fortress of the old campus. On my ride from the bus station to the campus, I'd barely glimpsed New Haven—a flash of crumpled building here, a trio of straggly kids there. A lot like Baltimore. But everything had changed when we reached those streets hooded by the gothic buildings. I imagined how the college must have looked when it was founded, when most of the students owned slaves. I pictured men wearing tights and knickers, smoking pipes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The architecture,” the dean repeated. She bit her lip and seemed to be making a calculation of some sort. I noticed that she blinked less often than most people. I sat there, waiting to see how long it would be before she blinked again.\n",

      "\n",
      "Shortly after getting my first D, I also received the first knock on my door. The female counsellors never knocked. The dean had spoken to them; I was a priority. Every other day, right before dinnertime, they'd look in on me, unannounced. “Just checking up,” a counsellor would say. It was the voice of a suburban mother in training. By the second week, I had made a point of sitting in a chair in front of the door, just when I expected a counsellor to pop her head around. This was intended to startle them. I also made a point of being naked. The unannounced visits ended.\n",
      "\n",
      "The knocking persisted. Through the peephole I saw a white face, distorted and balloonish.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Not a chance,” I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the person began to sob, and I heard a back slump against the door. If I hadn't known the person was white from the peephole, I'd have known it from a display like this. Black people didn't knock on strangers' doors, crying. Not that I understood the black people at Yale. There was something pitiful in how cool they were. Occasionally one would reach out to me with missionary zeal, but I'd rebuff that person with haughty silence.\n",

      "“When I was a child,” the person said, “I played by myself in a corner of the schoolyard all alone. I hated dolls and I hated games, animals were not friendly and birds flew away. If anyone was looking for me I hid behind a tree and cried out 'I am an orphan—' “\n",

      "\n",
      "The girl turned to face me, smiling weakly, as though her triumph were not in getting me to open the door but in the fact that she was able to smile at all when she was so accustomed to crying. She was large but not obese, and crying had turned her face the color of raw chicken. She blew her nose into the waist end of her T-shirt, revealing a pale belly.\n",

      "\n",
      "She looked at me with so little surprise that I suspected she hadn't discounted this as an option. Then her story came out in teary, hiccup-like bursts. She had sucked some “cute guy's dick” and he'd told everybody and now people thought she was “a slut.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why'd you suck his dick? Aren't you a lesbian?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She fit the bill. Short hair, hard, roach-stomping shoes. Dressed like an aspiring plumber. The lesbians I'd seen on TV were wiry, thin strips of muscle, but Heidi was round and soft and had a moonlike face. Drab mud-colored hair. And lesbians had cats. “Do you have a cat?” I asked.\n",
      "\n",

      "“O.K.” I said. “I could suck a guy's dick, too, if I wanted. But I don't. The human penis is one of the most germ-ridden objects there is.” Heidi looked at me, unconvinced. “What I meant to say,” I began again, “is that I don't like anybody. Period. Guys or girls. I'm a misanthrope.”\n",
      "\n",

It seemed straightforward, but then I learned better. You wouldn't believe what people could do with food until you worked in a dish room. Lettuce and crackers and soup would be bullied into a pulp in the bowl of some bored anorexic; ziti would be mixed with honey and granola; trays would appear heaped with mashed-potato snow women with melted chocolate ice cream for hair. Frat boys arrived at the dish-room window, en masse. They liked to fill glasses with food, then seal them, airtight, onto their trays. If you tried to prize them off, milk, Worcestershire sauce, peas, chunks of bread vomited onto your dish-room uniform.\n",

Clear amniotic fluid coated the can of cinnamon rolls. I left the bag there on the sidewalk, the groceries spilled out randomly like cards loosed from a deck. When I returned home, I told my mother that I'd lost the food stamps.\n",

I could have brought the groceries home and washed off the egg yolk, but, instead, I'd just left them there. “Come on,” mama said, snuffing her tears, pulling my arm, trying to get me to join her and start yanking cushions off the couch. “We'll find enough change here. We got to get something for dinner before your father gets back.”\n",

Something pawnable, perhaps.\n",

I left his office, walking quickly down the corridor, afraid to look back. It would be like him to trot after me, his navy blazer flapping, just to eke the truth out of me. You never kissed anyone. The words slid from my brain, and knotted in my stomach.\n",

      "When I reached my dorm, I found an old record player blocking my door and a Charles Mingus LP propped beside it. I carried them inside and then, lying on the floor, I played the Mingus over and over again until I fell asleep. I slept feeling as though Dr. Raeburn had attached electrodes to my head, willing into my mind a dream about my mother. I saw the lemon meringue of her skin, the long bone of her arm as she reached down to clip her toenails. I'd come home from a school trip to an aquarium, and I was explaining the differences between baleen and sperm whales according to the size of their heads, the range of their habitats, their feeding patterns.\n",

She looked like a tourist who'd asked for directions to a place she thought was simple enough to get to only to hear a series of hypothetical turns, alleys, one-way streets. Her response was to nod politely at the perilous elaborateness of it all; to nod in the knowledge that she would never be able to get where she wanted to go.\n",

      "The dishwashing machines were off, but steam still rose from them like a jungle mist. Outside in the winter air, students were singing carols in their groomed and tailored singing-group voices.

I got riled up by “The Autobiography of Malcolm X” and “The Chomsky Reader”; Heidi read aloud passages from “The Anxiety of Influence.” We guiltily read mysteries and “Clan of the Cave Bear,” then immediately threw them away.

One girl pronounced herself “out” as casually as if she'd announced the time. Another said nothing at all: she appeared at the microphone accompanied by a woman who began cutting off her waist-length, bleached-blond hair. The woman doing the cutting tossed the shorn hair in every direction as she cut. People were clapping and cheering and catching the locks of hair.\n",

A group of short-haired girls in thick black leather jackets, bundled up despite the summer heat, encircled Heidi in a protective fairy ring. They looked at me critically, clearly wondering if Heidi was too fragile for my company.\n",

      "She shook her head and smiled weakly. “You don't get it,” she said. “My mother is dead.” She closed her suitcase, clicking shut the old-fashioned locks. “My mother is dead,” she said again, this time reminding herself. She set the suitcase upright on the floor and sat on it. She looked like someone waiting for a train.\n",
      "\n",

      "Heidi went to Vancouver for her mother's funeral. I didn't go. Instead, I went back to Baltimore and moved in with an aunt I barely knew. Every day was the same: I read and smoked outside my aunt's apartment, studying the row of hair salons across the street, where girls in denim cutoffs and tank tops would troop in and come out hours later, a flash of neon nails, coifs the color and sheen of patent leather. And every day I imagined visiting Heidi in Vancouver. Her house would not be large, but it would be clean. Flowery shrubs would line the walks. The Canadian wind would whip us about like pennants. I'd be visiting her at some vague time in the future, deliberately vague, for people like me, who realign past events to suit themselves. In that future time, you always have a chance to catch the groceries before they fall, your words can always be rewound and erased, rewritten and revised.\n",
      "\n",
      "But once I imagined Heidi visiting me. There would be no psychiatrists or deans. No boys with nice shoes or flip cashiers. Just me in my single room. She would knock on the door and say, “Open up.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Now, before I begin today, I have a confession to make. I get extremely nervous in front of big crowds, so at any point in my speech if I seem nervous, it's because I am.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's kind of ironic when I think about it because I play at venues such as Ohio State, Michigan and Penn State where the crowds exceed over 100,000 people, but any time I'm asked to come in front of a crowd such as there is today, I immediately start sweating. Trust me nothing is more intimidating than speaking in a room full of determined reporters. I know you see big guys like my guy Shilique Calhoun walking in and I know you think he's pretty intimidating, but trust me we have nothing on you guys.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that being said, I really want to thank the Big Ten Conference for giving me the opportunity to speak today. It's truly an honor.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know a lot of you guys might not realize it, but I'm truly a Big Ten guy. I say that because in 2011, which was my freshman year at Nebraska, it was also Nebraska's inaugural year of entering the Big Ten. I'm proud to say that the Big Ten is the only conference I've ever known. For the universities of Maryland and Rutgers, who are entering the Big Ten this year, you too will soon realize that the academic and athletic prestige of the Big Ten is second to none.\n",
      "\n",
      "Welcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know, we live in a capitalist society. From the stock markets on Wall Street to the everyday vendors on street corners, almost every aspect of our lives is affected by capitalism. As a sports fan, I've noticed that capitalism has reared its head in the realm of college athletics, mainly on the debate of whether college football players should be paid or not. In fact, these debates have become so contentious that lawsuits have been filed and the National Labor Relations Board has granted players from fellow Big Ten member Northwestern the opportunity to form a union.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, it would be easy for me to stand up here and give you my personal beliefs and standpoint on the economic opportunities that may come for college athletics and college football players in the future, but that's not what I'm here to do. Instead, if I may, I'd like to touch on something that I think gets overlooked far too often, and that's something I like to call the essence of the student-athlete. What is the essence of the student-athlete? That is, what are the fundamental attributes that make up a student-athlete?\n",
      "\n",
      "Now we all know a student-athlete is someone who participates in one or more athletic (programs) at their college. To me, that doesn't encompass the true essence of a student-athlete. To me, the true essence of a student-athlete is someone who has the desire to educate themselves athletically, academically and personally.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've all heard the phrase before: 'dumb jocks.' I'm here to tell you guys today that by and large, student-athletes are no dummies. In fact, the essence of a student-athlete requires a student-athlete to educate themselves in many ways, including athletically.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, as I look into the crowd I may see a couple of confused faces. You may be thinking, \"Ameer, how does an athlete educate themselves on athletics?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, besides the obvious athletic lessons learned on the field such as the X's and O's or defensive strategies or offensive strategies, there are many ways that a student-athlete can educate themselves in athletics. For example, thinking back to my first fall camp in 2011, I can still remember my first toss play. There I was in the backfield, my shining moment, thinking, 'I'm going to take this toss to the crib.' As Taylor tossed me the ball, I made a nice little move to the outside and cut up field. Then — out of nowhere — All-American linebacker Lavonte David came screaming at me like a bat out of hell and completely destroyed me. Only as Lavonte could do, he got up throwing the ball and celebrating as he always does, thus dashing my hopes of getting in the end zone that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I sat there humiliated and embarrassed, in that moment I learned a very valuable lesson. In life, there's always going to be someone stronger than you. There's always going to be someone faster than you. Often times, there's going to be someone smarter than you. But you can not let that deter you from your goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "If someone is stronger than you, you have to train harder.\n",
      "\n",
      "If someone is faster than you, you have to run smarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "If someone is smarter than you, you have to train longer and harder.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a student-athlete, I've learned that in order to be successful in life, you have to make critical sacrifices in life in order to accomplish your goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I think about it, my experience with athletics in college has allowed me to check my ego. In fact, it's allowed me to be a better teammate and a better man. I say that because, taking you guys back to my freshman year once again, I came in with three other running backs — myself, Braylon Heard and Aaron Green. And although we were all individually talented, none of us saw any significant time at running back that freshman year.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's kind of funny thinking about it. Because we didn't get that many carries, we all called ourselves \"Team No Tugs,\" because in every game we probably averaged like two carries between all three of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "All joking aside, that probably was the best thing that could have happened to us, because this was the first time in our athletic careers that we were not the focal points of our team's offense. But instead of developing a bad attitude or blaming someone else for our current predicament, instead we found other ways to contribute to the team — special teams or being great servicemen during practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that instance I learned another very valuable lesson about life: Every person on the team plays a very important role, and any person in a company for that matter plays a very important role.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every person plays an important role in the team. And the overall success of a team doesn't depend on only the starters, but everyone working together to accomplish a common goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The academic education that I've received helps me form the essence of a student-athlete. In examining the word student-athlete, notice that the word student comes first, as it rightfully should. And contrary to common belief, being a student is the most important job that an athlete has. Think about it for a minute. If our grades aren't up to par, we won't and we shouldn't be allowed to play. But aside from the athletic repercussions that one may face for not taking advantage of their educational opportunity, studies have shown that obtaining a college degree has some significant economic advantages.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, I read somewhere over one's life, a college graduate earns up to a million dollars more than someone with a high school diploma. Just think about that for a minute. A million dollars. That's like saying you can win the lottery by going to class and just doing your work. Now if that's not motivation for us student-athletes to go to class, I guess nothing will.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from winning the educational lottery, obtaining a college education is critically important to every student and should be specifically important to all the college football players in this room. For one, not everyone is going to have the opportunity to play in the NFL. And two, if you are fortunate enough to play in the NFL, the average career is less than five years. So that means you have a lot of living to do after playing days are over.\n",
      "\n",
      "The education that one obtains in college can help lay down the groundwork for whatever career a player chooses to pursue after playing days are over. You see, education is more than a degree or certificate that one receives after fulfilling the requirements for graduation. Education is a life-long process.\n",
      "\n",
      "However the heart and soul of the essence of the student-athlete is personal education.\n",
      "\n",
      "Personal education is like a fingerprint. It's unique. Thus, every student's personal education is different. For me, my journey has caused me to face some harsh realities. For one, I'm no longer a child. And for two, as a man, every decision I make has severe consequences. At no other point in my life was this realization more painfully clear than the last time I visited home. You see, a couple months ago I went home to visit my family in Alabama. And as I usually do, I also visited my friends. And wow, a lot of things have changed in just three years.\n",
      "\n",
      "During my visit I learned that one of my best friends, who also went to college on an athletic scholarship, got hooked onto drugs and flunked out of school. Even more disturbing was the fact that one of my best friends who I also grew up with was sentenced to 25 years in prison.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sorry, I get a little emotional thinking about it — I remember thinking to myself, how could this happen to these guys? These weren't people who I read about or see on TV, these were my best friends. Guys who I knew from elementary school to high school, and all these things were happening to them. That's when reality set in for me. If it could happen to them, it could happen to any student-athlete in this room today. It only takes one bad decision to derail all of our hopes and dreams.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I get ready for my final season in college, both the opportunity the Big Ten Conference has given me to compete in and the education I have received at the University of Nebraska combined to give me the tools needed to make great life decisions and to encompass the true essence of the student-athlete. You see, nothing — nothing — is guaranteed. But if we continuously strive to educate ourselves athletically, academically and personally, than maybe — just maybe — one day we can reach our full potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you and good luck to everyone this season. Get 'em, 'Skers!”\n",

      "This event is pivotal in the Christian faith. When we believe that JESUS died for our sins and was risen again, we are taking a big step in becoming a follower of the LORD. The LORD's followers will be risen up as well in the end times. Read Romans 8:11-\n",

There in the ground His body lay, Light of the world by darkness slain: Then bursting forth in glorious day Up from the grave He rose again And as He stands in victory Sin's curse has lost its grip on me, For I am His and He is mine Bought with the precious blood of Christ No guilt in life, no fear in death, This is the power of Christ in me From life's first cry to final breath, Jesus commands my destiny No power of hell, no scheme of man, Can ever pluck me from His hand Till He returns or calls me home Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.\n",

One concept which I found extremely good was the lack of God: only Saints are worshipped in Ravka. That's a lot. That's humanist. If there is no God to answer to, no God to test you, every human can be a Saint. It would be great to explore, the concept that without a God you can aim even higher. But sadly, none of this is ever explained. The whole tsarpunk aesthetic is just an aesthetic 95% of the time. I wish Leigh Bardugo had been braver, I wish she'd gone into the light/darkness duality, the humanizing/dehumanizing effect of eternity, the real meaning of a name, the meaning of power.

      "Did you know that probing the seamy underbelly of U.S. lexicography reveals ideological strife and controversy and intrigue and nastiness and fervor on a nearly hanging-chad scale? For instance, did you know that some modern dictionaries are notoriously liberal and others notoriously conservative, and that certain conservative dictionaries were actually conceived and designed as corrective responses to the \"corruption\" and \"permissiveness\" of certain liberal dictionaries? That the oligarchic device of having a special \"Distinguished Usage Panel ... of outstanding professional speakers and writers\" is an attempted compromise between the forces of egalitarianism and traditionalism in English, but that most linguistic liberals dismiss the Usage Panel as mere sham-populism? Did you know that U.S. lexicography even had a seamy underbelly?\n",
      "\n",
      "The occasion for this article is Oxford University Press's semi-recent release of Bryan A. Garner's A Dictionary of Modern American Usage. The fact of the matter is that Garner's dictionary is extremely good, certainly the most comprehensive usage guide since E. W. Gilman's Webster's Dictionary of English Usage, now a decade out of date.[1] Its format, like that of Gilman and the handful of other great American usage guides of the last century, includes entries on individual words and phrases and expostulative small-cap MINI-ESSAYS. on any issue broad enough to warrant more general discussion. But the really distinctive and ingenious features of A Dictionary of Modern American Usage involve issues of rhetoric and ideology and style, and it is impossible to describe why these issues are important and why Garner's management of them borders on genius without talking about the historical contexts [2] in which ADMAU appears, and this context turns out to be a veritable hurricane of controversies involving everything from technical linguistics to public education to political ideology, and these controversies take a certain amount of time to unpack before their relation to what makes Garner's usage guide so eminently worth your hard-earned reference-book dollar can even be established; and in fact there's no way even to begin the whole harrowing polymeric discussion without taking a moment to establish and define the highly colloquial term SNOOT.\n",
      "\n",
      "From one perspective, a certain irony attends the publication of any good new book on American usage. It is that the people who are going to be interested in such a book are also the people who are least going to need it, i.e., that offering counsel on the finer points of U.S. English is Preaching to the Choir. The relevant Choir here comprises that small percentage of American citizens who actually care about the current status of double modals and ergative verbs. The same sorts of people who watched Story of English on PBS (twice) and read W. Safire's column with their half-caff every Sunday. The sorts of people who feel that special blend of wincing despair and sneering superiority when they see EXPRESS LANE — 10 ITEMS OR LESS or hear dialogue used as a verb or realize that the founders of the Super 8 motel chain must surely have been ignorant of the meaning of suppurate. There are lots of epithets for people like this — Grammar Nazis, Usage Nerds, Syntax Snobs, the Language Police. The term I was raised with is SNOOT.[3] The word might be slightly self-mocking, but those other terms are outright dysphemisms. A SNOOT can be defined as somebody who knows what dysphemism means and doesn't mind letting you know it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I submit that we SNOOTs are just about the last remaining kind of truly elitist nerd. There are, granted, plenty of nerd-species in today's America, and some of these are elitist within their own nerdy purview (e.g., the skinny, carbuncular, semi-autistic Computer Nerd moves instantly up on the totem pole of status when your screen freezes and now you need his help, and the bland condescension with which he performs the two occult keystrokes that unfreeze your screen is both elitist and situationally valid). But the SNOOT's purview is interhuman social life itself. You don't, after all (despite withering cultural pressure), have to use a computer, but you can't escape language: Language is everything and everywhere; it's what lets us have anything to do with one another; it's what separates us from the animals; Genesis 11:7-10 and so on. And we SNOOTS know when and how to hyphenate phrasal adjectives and to keep participles from dangling, and we know that we know, and we know how very few other Americans know this stuff or even care, and we judge them accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "In ways that certain of us are uncomfortable about, SNOOTs' attitudes about contemporary usage resemble religious/political conservatives' attitudes about contemporary culture:[4] We combine a missionary zeal and a near-neural faith in our beliefs' importance with a curmudgeonly hell-in-a-handbasket despair at the way English is routinely manhandled and corrupted by supposedly educated people. The Evil is all around us: boners and clunkers and solecistic howlers and bursts of voguish linguistic methane that make any SNOOT's cheek twitch and forehead darken. A fellow SNOOT I know likes to say that listening to most people's English feels like watching somebody use a Stradivarius to pound nails. We[5] are the Few, the Proud, the Appalled at Everyone Else.\n",
      "\n",
      "THESIS STATEMENT FOR WHOLE ARTICLE\n",
      "\n",
      "Issues of tradition vs. egalitarianism in U.S. English are at root political issues and can be effectively addressed only in what this article hereby terms a \"Democratic Spirit.\" A Democratic Spirit is one that combines rigor and humility, i.e., passionate conviction plus sedulous respect for the convictions of others. As any American knows, this is a very difficult spirit to cultivate and maintain, particularly when it comes to issues you feel strongly about. Equally tough is a D.S.'s criterion of 100 percent intellectual integrity — you have to be willing to look honestly at yourself and your motives for believing what you believe, and to do it more or less continually.\n",
      "\n",
      "This kind of stuff is advanced U.S. citizenship. A true Democratic Spirit is up there with religious faith and emotional maturity and all those other top-of-the-Maslow-Pyramid-type qualities people spend their whole lives working on. A Democratic Spirit's constituent rigor and humility and honesty are in fact so hard to maintain on certain issues that it's almost irresistibly tempting to fall in with some established dogmatic camp and to follow that camp's line on the issue and to let your position harden within the camp and become inflexible and to believe that any other camp is either evil or insane and to spend all your time and energy trying to shout over them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I submit, then, that it is indisputably easier to be dogmatic than Democratic, especially about issues that are both vexed and highly charged. I submit further that the issues surrounding \"correctness\" in contemporary American usage are both vexed and highly charged, and that the fundamental questions they involve are ones whose answers have to be \"worked out\" instead of simply found.\n",
      "\n",
      "A distinctive feature of ADMAU is that its author is willing to acknowledge that a usage dictionary is not a bible or even a textbook but rather just the record of one smart person's attempts to work out answers to certain very difficult questions. This willingness appears to me to be informed by a Democratic Spirit. The big question is whether such a spirit compromises Garner's ability to present himself as a genuine \"authority\" on issues of usage. Assessing Garner's book, then, involves trying to trace out the very weird and complicated relationship between Authority and Democracy in what we as a culture have decided is English. That relationship is, as many educated Americans would say, still in process at this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Dictionary of Modern American Usage has no Editorial Staff or Distinguished Panel. It's conceived, researched, and written ab ovo usque ad mala by Bryan Garner. This is an interesting guy. He's both a lawyer and a lexicographer (which seems a bit like being both a narcotics dealer and a DEA agent). His 1987 A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage is already a minor classic; now, instead of practicing law anymore, he goes around conducting writing seminars for J.D.'s and doing prose-consulting for various judicial bodies. Garner's also the founder of something called the H. W. Fowler Society,[6] a worldwide group of usage-Trekkies who like to send one another linguistic boners clipped from different periodicals. You get the idea. This Garner is one serious and very hard-core SNOOT.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lucid, engaging, and extremely sneaky Preface to ADMAU serves to confirm Garner's SNOOTitude in fact while undercutting it in tone. For one thing, whereas the traditional usage pundit cultivates a sort of remote and imperial persona — the kind who uses one or we to refer to himself — Garner gives us an almost Waltonishly endearing sketch of his own background:\n",
      "\n",
      "I realized early at the age of 15[7] — that my primary\n",
      "intellectual interest was the use of the English language....\n",
      "It became an all-consuming passion.... I read everything\n",
      "I could find on the subject. Then, on a wintry evening\n",
      "while visiting New Mexico at the age of 16, I discovered\n",
      "Eric Partridge's Usage and Abusage. I was enthralled.\n",
      "Never had I held a more exciting book.... Suffice it\n",
      "to say that by the time I was 18, I had committed to\n",
      "memory most of Fowler, Partridge, and their successors....\n",
      "\n",
      "Although this reviewer regrets the biosketch's failure to mention the rather significant social costs of being an adolescent whose overriding passion is English usage,[8] the critical hat is off to yet another personable section of the Preface, one that Garner entitles \"First Principles\": \"Before going any further, I should explain my approach. That's an unusual thing for the author of a usage dictionary to do — unprecedented, as far as I know. But a guide to good writing is only as good as the principles on which it's based. And users should be naturally interested in those principles. So, in the interests of full disclosure ...\"[9]\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"unprecedented\" and \"full disclosure\" here are actually good-natured digs at Garner's Fowlerite predecessors, and a subtle nod to one camp in the wars that have raged in both lexicography and education ever since the notoriously liberal Webster's Third New International Dictionary came out in 1961 and included such terms as heighth and irregardless without any monitory labels on them. You can think of Webster's Third as sort of the Fort Sumter of the contemporary Usage Wars. These Wars are both the context and the target of a very subtle rhetorical strategy in A Dictionary of Modern American Usage, and without talking about them it's impossible to explain why Garner's book is both so good and so sneaky.\n",
      "\n",
      "We regular citizens tend to go to The Dictionary for authoritative guidance.[10] Rarely, however, do we ask ourselves who decides what gets in The Dictionary or what words or spellings or pronunciations get deemed \"substandard\" or \"incorrect.\" Whence the authority of dictionary-makers to decide what's OK[11] and what isn't? Nobody elected them, after all. And simply appealing to precedent or tradition won't work, because what's considered correct changes over time. In the 1600s, for instance, the second-singular pronoun took a singular conjugation — \"You is.\" Earlier still, the standard 2-S pronoun wasn't \"you\" but \"thou\". Huge numbers of now acceptable words like clever, fun, banter, and prestigious entered English as what usage authorities considered errors or egregious slang. And not just usage conventions but English itself changes over time; if it didn't, we'd all still be talking like Chaucer. Who's to say which changes are natural and which are corruptions? And when Bryan Garner or E. Ward Gilman do in fact presume to say, why should we believe them?\n",
      "\n",
      "These sorts of questions are not new, but they do now have a certain urgency. America is in the midst of a protracted Crisis of Authority in matters of language. In brief, the same sorts of political upheavals that produced everything from Kent State to Independent Counsels have produced an influential contra-SNOOT school for whom normative standards of English grammar and usage are functions of nothing but custom and superstition and the ovine docility of a populace that lets self-appointed language authorities boss them around. See for example MIT's Steven Pinker in a famous New Republic article — \"Once introduced, a prescriptive rule is very hard to eradicate, no matter how ridiculous. Inside the writing establishment, the rules survive by the same dynamic that perpetuates ritual genital mutilations\" — or, at a somewhat lower pitch, Bill Bryson in Mother Tongue: English and How It Got That Way:\n",
      "\n",
      "Who sets down all those rules that we all know\n",
      "about from childhood: the idea that we must never\n",
      "end a sentence with a preposition or begin one with\n",
      "a conjunction, that we must use \"each other\" for two\n",
      "things and \"one another\" for more than two ...? The\n",
      "answer, surprisingly often, is that no one does,\n",
      "that when you look into the background of these\n",
      "\"rules\" there is often little basis for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "In ADMAU's Preface, Garner himself addresses the Authority Question with a Trumanesque simplicity and candor that simultaneously disguise the author's cunning and exemplify it:\n",
      "\n",
      "As you might already suspect, I don't shy away\n",
      "from making judgments. I can't imagine that most\n",
      "readers would want me to. Linguists don't like it,\n",
      "of course, because judgment involves subjectivity.[12]\n",
      "It isn't scientific. But rhetoric and usage, in the view\n",
      "of most professional writers, aren't scientific endeavors.\n",
      "You don't want dispassionate descriptions; you want\n",
      "sound guidance. And that requires judgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whole monographs could be written just on the masterful rhetoric of this passage. Note for example the ingenious equivocation of judgment in \"I don't shy away from making judgments\" vs. \"And that requires judgment.\" Suffice it to say that Garner is at all times keenly aware of the Authority Crisis in modern usage; and his response to this crisis is in the best Democratic Spirit rhetorical.\n",
      "\n",
      "So ...\n",
      "\n",
      "COROLLARY TO THESIS STATEMENT FOR WHOLE ARTICLE\n",
      "\n",
      "The most salient and timely feature of Garner's book is that it's both lexicographical and rhetorical. Its main strategy involves what is known in classical rhetoric as the Ethical Appeal. Here the adjective, derived from the Greek ethos, doesn't mean quite what we usually mean by ethical. But there are affinities. What the Ethical Appeal amounts to is a complex and sophisticated \"Trust me.\" It's the boldest, most ambitious, and also most distinctively American of rhetorical Appeals, because it requires the rhetor to convince us not just of his intellectual acuity or technical competence but of his basic decency and fairness and sensitivity to the audience's own hopes and fears.[13]\n",
      "\n",
      "These are not qualities one associates with the traditional SNOOT usage-authority, a figure who pretty much instantiates snobbishness and bow-tied anality, and one whose modern image is not improved by stuff like American Heritage Dictionary Distinguished Usage Panelist Morris Bishop's \"The arrant solecisms of the ignoramus are here often omitted entirely, `irregardless' of how he may feel about this neglect\" or critic John Simon's \"The English language is being treated nowadays exactly as slave traders once handled their merchandise....\" Compare those lines' authorial personas with Garner's in, e.g., \"English usage is so challenging that even experienced writers need guidance now and then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The thrust here is going to be that A Dictionary of Modern American Usage earns Garner pretty much all the trust his Ethical Appeal asks us for. The book's \"feel-good\" spirit (in the very best sense of \"feel-good\") marries rigor and humility in such a way as to allow Garner to be extremely prescriptive without any appearance of evangelism or elitist putdown. This is an extraordinary accomplishment. Understanding why it's basically a rhetorical accomplishment, and why this is both historically significant and (in this reviewer's opinion) politically redemptive, requires a more detailed look at the Usage Wars.\n",
      "\n",
      "You'd sure know lexicography had an underbelly if you read the little introductory essays in modern dictionaries — pieces like Webster's DEU's \"A Brief History of English Usage\" or Webster's Third's \"Linguistic Advances and Lexicography\" or AHD-3's \"Usage in the American Heritage Dictionary: The Place of Criticism.\" But almost nobody ever bothers with these little intros, and it's not just their six-point type or the fact that dictionaries tend to be hard on the lap. It's that these intros aren't actually written for you or me or the average citizen who goes to The Dictionary just to see how to spell (for instance) meringue. They're written for other lexicographers and critics, and in fact they're not really introductory at all but polemical. They're salvos in the Usage Wars that have been under way ever since editor Philip Gove first sought to apply the value-neutral principles of structural linguistics to lexicography in Webster's Third. Gove's famous response to conservatives who howled[14] when Webster's Third endorsed OK and described ain't as \"used orally in most parts of the U.S. by many cultivated speakers [sic]\" was this: \"A dictionary should have no traffic with ... artificial notions of correctness or superiority. It should be descriptive and not prescriptive.\" These terms stuck and turned epithetic, and linguistic conservatives are now formally known as Prescriptivists and linguistic liberals as Descriptivists.\n",
      "\n",
      "The former are far better known. When you read the columns of William Safire or Morton Freeman or books like Edwin Newman's Strictly Speaking or John Simon's Paradigms Lost, you're actually reading Popular Prescriptivism, a genre sideline of certain journalists (mostly older ones, the vast majority of whom actually do wear bow ties) whose bemused irony often masks a Colonel Blimp's rage at the way the beloved English of their youth is being trashed in the decadent present. The plutocratic tone and styptic wit of Safire and Newman and the best of the Prescriptivists is often modeled after the mandarin-Brit personas of Eric Partridge and H. W. Fowler, the same Twin Towers of scholarly Prescriptivism whom Garner talks about revering as a kid.[15]\n",
      "\n",
      "Descriptivists, on the other hand, don't have weekly columns in the Times. These guys tend to be hard-core academics, mostly linguists or Comp theorists. Loosely organized under the banner of structural (or \"descriptive\") linguistics, they are doctrinaire positivists who have their intellectual roots in the work of Auguste Comte and Ferdinand de Saussure and their ideological roots firmly in the U.S. sixties. The brief explicit mention Garner's Preface gives this crew —\n",
      "\n",
      "Somewhere along the line, though, usage dictionaries\n",
      "got hijacked by the descriptive linguists.[16] who observe\n",
      "language scientifically. For the pure descriptivist, it's\n",
      "impermissible to say that one form of language is\n",
      "any better than another: as long as a native speaker\n",
      "says it, it's OK — and anyone who takes a contrary\n",
      "stand is a dunderhead.... Essentially, descriptivists and\n",
      "prescriptivists are approaching different problems.\n",
      "Descriptivists want to record language as it's actually\n",
      "used, and they perform a useful function — though\n",
      "their audience is generally limited to those willing to pore\n",
      "through vast tomes of dry-as-dust research.\n",
      "\n",
      "— is disingenuous in the extreme, especially the \"approaching different problems\" part, because it vastly underplays the Descriptivists' influence on U.S. culture. For one thing, Descriptivism so quickly and thoroughly took over English education in this country that just about everybody who started junior high after c. 1970 has been taught to write Descriptively — via \"freewriting,\" \"brainstorming,\" \"journaling,\" a view of writing as self-exploratory and -expressive rather than as communicative, an abandonment of systematic grammar, usage, semantics, rhetoric, etymology. For another thing, the very language in which today's socialist, feminist, minority, gay, and environmentalist movements frame their sides of political debates is informed by the Descriptivist belief that traditional English is conceived and perpetuated by Privileged WASP Males[17] and is thus inherently capitalist, sexist, racist, xenophobic, homophobic, elitist: unfair. Think Ebonics. Think of the involved contortions people undergo to avoid he as a generic pronoun, or of the tense deliberate way white males now adjust their vocabularies around non-w.m.'s. Think of today's endless battles over just the names of things — \"Affirmative Action\" vs. \"Reverse Discrimination,\" \"Pro-Life\" vs. \"Pro-Choice,\" \"Undercount\" vs. \"Vote Fraud,\" etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Descriptivist revolution takes a little time to unpack, but it's worth it. The structural linguists' rejection of conventional usage rules depends on two main arguments. The first is academic and methodological. In this age of technology, Descriptivists contend, it's the Scientific Method — clinically objective, value-neutral, based on direct observation and demonstrable hypothesis — that should determine both the content of dictionaries and the standards of \"correct\" English. Because language is constantly evolving, such standards will always be fluid. Gore's now classic introduction to Webster's Third outlines this type of Descriptivism's five basic edicts:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"1 — Language changes constantly;\n",
      "\n",
      "2 — Change is normal;\n",
      "\n",
      "3 — Spoken language is the language;\n",
      "\n",
      "4 — Correctness rests upon usage;\n",
      "\n",
      "5 — All usage is relative.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "These principles look prima facie OK — commonsensical and couched in the bland simple s.-v.-o, prose of dispassionate Science — but in fact they're vague and muddled and it takes about three seconds to think of reasonable replies to each one of them, viz.:\n",
      "\n",
      "1 — OK, but how much and how fast?\n",
      "\n",
      "2 — Same thing. Is Heraclitean flux as normal or desirable as gradual change ? Do some changes actually serve the language's overall pizzazz better than others? And how many people have to deviate from how many conventions before we say the language has actually changed? Fifty percent? Ten percent?\n",
      "\n",
      "3 — This is an old claim, at least as old as Plato's Phaedrus. And it's specious. If Derrida and the infamous Deconstructionists have done nothing else, they've debunked the idea that speech is language's primary instantiation.[18] Plus consider the weird arrogance of Gove's (3) w/r/t correctness. Only the most mullahlike Prescriptivists care very much about spoken English; most Prescriptive usage guides concern Standard Written English.[19]\n",

      "4 — Fine, but whose usage? Gove's (4) begs the whole question. What he wants to imply here, I think, is a reversal of the traditional entailment-relation between abstract rules and concrete usage: Instead of usage ideally corresponding to a rigid set of regulations, the regulations ought to correspond to the way real people are actually using the language. Again, fine, but which people? Urban Latinos? Boston Brahmins? Rural Midwesterners? Appalachian Neogaelics?\n",
      "\n",
      "5 — Huh? If this means what it seems to mean, then it ends up biting Gove's whole argument in the ass. (5) appears to imply that the correct answer to the above \"which people?\" is: \"All of them!\" And it's easy to show why this will not stand up as a lexicographical principle. The most obvious problem with it is that not everything can go in The Dictionary. Why not? Because you can't observe every last bit of every last native speaker's \"language behavior,\" and even if you could, the resultant dictionary would weigh 4 million pounds and have to be updated hourly.[20] The fact is that any lexicographer is going to have to make choices about what gets in and what doesn't. And these choices are based on ... what? And now we're right back where we started.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is true that, as a SNOOT, I am probably neurologically predisposed to look for flaws in Gove et al.'s methodological argument. But these flaws seem awfully easy to find. Probably the biggest one is that the Descriptivists' \"scientific lexicography\" — under which, keep in mind, the ideal English dictionary is basically number-crunching; you somehow observe every linguistic act by every native/naturalized speaker of English and put the sum of all these acts between two covers and call it The Dictionary — involves an incredibly simplistic and outdated understanding of what \"scientific\" means. It requires a naive belief in scientific objectivity, for one thing. Even in the physical sciences, everything from quantum mechanics to Information Theory has shown that an act of observation is itself part of the phenomenon observed and is analytically inseparable from it.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you remember your old college English classes, there's an analogy here that points up the trouble scholars get into when they confuse observation with interpretation. Recall the New Critics.[21] They believed that literary criticism was best conceived as a \"scientific\" endeavor: The critic was a neutral, careful, unbiased, highly trained observer whose job was to find and objectively describe meanings that were right there — literally inside — pieces of literature. Whether you know what happened to the New Criticism's reputation depends on whether you took college English after c. 1975; suffice it to say that its star bas dimmed. The New Critics had the same basic problem as Gove's Methodological Descriptivists: They believed that scientific meant the same thing as neutral or unbiased. And that linguistic meanings could exist \"objectively,\" separate from any interpretive act.\n",
      "\n",
      "The point of the analogy is that claims to objectivity in language study are now the stuff of jokes and shudders. The epistemological assumptions that underlie Methodological Descriptivism have been thoroughly debunked and displaced — n Lit by the rise of post-structuralism, Reader-Response Criticism, and Jaussian Reception Theory; in linguistics by the rise of Pragmatics — and it's now pretty much universally accepted that (a) meaning is inseparable from some act of interpretation and (b) an act of interpretation is always somewhat biased, i.e., informed by the interpreter's particular ideology. And the consequence of (a) and (b) is that there's no way around it — decisions about what to put in The Dictionary and what to exclude are going to be based on a lexicographer's ideology. And every lexicographer's got one. To presume that dictionary-making can somehow avoid or transcend ideology is simply to subscribe to a particular ideology, one that might aptly be called Unbelievably Naive Positivism.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's an even more important way Descriptivists are wrong in thinking that the Scientific Method is appropriate to the study of language:\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if, as a thought experiment, we assume a kind of nineteenth-century scientific realism-in which, even though some scientists' interpretations of natural phenomena might be biased[22] the natural phenomena themselves can be supposed to exist wholly independent of either observation or interpretation — no such realist supposition can be made about \"language behavior,\" because this behavior is both human and fundamentally normative. To understand this, you have only to accept the proposition that language is by its very nature public — i.e., that there can be no such thing as a Private Language[23] and then to observe the way Methodological Descriptivists seem either ignorant of this fact or oblivious to its consequences, as in for example one Charles Fries's introduction to an epigone of Webster's Third called The American College Dictionary:\n",
      "\n",
      "A dictionary can be an \"authority\" only in the\n",
      "sense in which a book of chemistry or of physics\n",
      "or of botany can be an \"authority\": by the accuracy\n",
      "and the completeness of its record of the observed\n",
      "facts of the field examined, in accord with the latest\n",
      "principles and techniques of the particular science.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is so stupid it practically drools. An \"authoritative\" physics text presents the results of physicists' observations and physicists' theories about those observations. If a physics textbook operated on Descriptivist principles, the fact that some Americans believe that electricity flows better downhill (based on the observed fact that power lines tend to run high above the homes they serve) would require the Electricity Flows Better Downhill Theory to be included as a \"valid\" theory in the textbook — just as, for Dr. Fries, if some Americans use infer for imply, the use becomes an ipso facto \"valid\" part of the language. Structural linguists like Gove and Fries are not, finally, scientists but census-takers who happen to misconstrue the importance of \"observed facts.\" It isn't scientific phenomena they're tabulating but rather a set of human behaviors, and a lot of human behaviors are — to be blunt — moronic. Try, for instance, to imagine an \"authoritative\" ethics textbook whose principles were based on what most people actually do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Norm-wise, let's keep in mind that language didn't come into being because our hairy ancestors were sitting around the veldt with nothing better to do. Language was invented to serve certain specific purposes:[24] \"That mushroom is poisonous\"; \"Knock these two rocks together and you can start a fire\"; \"This shelter is mine!\" And so on. Clearly, as linguistic communities evolve over time, they discover that some ways of using language are \"better\" than others — meaning better with respect to the community's purposes. If we assume that one such purpose might be communicating which kinds of food are safe to eat, then you can see how, for example, a misplaced modifier might violate an important norm:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"People who eat that kind of mushroom often get sick\" confuses the recipient about whether he'll get sick only if he eats the mushroom frequently or whether he stands a good chance of getting sick the very first time he eats it. In other words, the community has a vested practical interest in excluding this kind of misplaced modifier from acceptable usage; and even if a certain percentage of tribesmen screw up and use them, this still doesn't make m.m.'s a good idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe now the analogy between usage and ethics is clearer. Just because people sometimes lie, cheat on their taxes, or scream at their kids, this doesn't mean that they think those things are \"good.\" The whole point of norms is to help us evaluate our actions (including utterances) according to what we as a community have decided our real interests and purposes are. Granted, this analysis is oversimplified; in practice it's incredibly hard to arrive at norms and to keep them at least minimally fair or sometimes even to agree on what they are (q.v. today's Culture Wars). But the Descriptivists' assumption that all usage norms are arbitrary and dispensable leads to — well, have a mushroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "The connotations of arbitrary here are tricky, though, and this sort of segues into the second argument Descriptivists make. There is a sense in which specific linguistic conventions are arbitrary. For instance, there's no particular metaphysical reason why our word for a four-legged mammal that gives milk and goes Moo is cow and not, say, prtlmpf. The uptown phrase for this is \"the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign,\" and it's used, along with certain principles of cognitive science and generative grammar, in a more philosophically sophisticated version of Descriptivism that holds the conventions of SWE to be more like the niceties of fashion than like actual norms. This \"Philosophical Descriptivism\" doesn't care much about dictionaries or method; its target is the standard SNOOT claim supra — that prescriptive rules have their ultimate justification in the community's need to make its language meaningful.\n",
      "\n",
      "The argument goes like this. An English sentence's being meaningful is not the same as its being grammatical. That is, such clearly ill-formed constructions as \"Did you seen the car keys of me?\" or \"The show was looked by many people\" are nevertheless comprehensible; the sentences do, more or less, communicate the information they're trying to get across. Add to this the fact that nobody who isn't damaged in some profound Oliver Sacksish way actually ever makes these sorts of very deep syntactic errors[25] and you get the basic proposition of Noam Chomsky's generative linguistics, which is that there exists a Universal Grammar beneath and common to all languages, plus that there is probably an actual part of the human brain that's imprinted with this Universal Grammar the same way birds' brains are imprinted with Fly South and dogs' with Sniff Genitals. There's all kinds of compelling evidence and support for these ideas, not least of which are the advances that linguists and cognitive scientists and A.I. researchers have been able to make with them, and the theories have a lot of credibility, and they are adduced by the Philosophical Descriptivists to show that since the really important rules of language are at birth already hardwired into people's neocortex; SWE prescriptions against dangling participles or mixed metaphors are basically the linguistic equivalent of whalebone corsets and short forks for salad. As Descriptivist Steven Pinker puts it, \"When a scientist considers all the high-tech mental machinery needed to order words into everyday sentences, prescriptive rules are, at best, inconsequential decorations.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This argument is not the barrel of drugged trout that Methodological Descriptivism was, but it's still vulnerable to some objections. The first one is easy. Even if it's true that we're all wired with a Universal Grammar, it simply doesn't follow that all prescriptive rules are superfluous. Some of these rules really do seem to serve clarity, and precision. The injunction against twoway adverbs (\"People who eat this often get sick\") is an obvious example, as are rules about other kinds of misplaced modifiers (\"There are many reasons why lawyers lie, some better than others\") and about relative pronouns' proximity to the nouns they modify (\"She's the mother of an infant daughter who works twelve hours a day\").\n",
      "\n",
      "Granted the Philosophical Descriptivist can question just how absolutely necessary these rules are, it's quite likely that a recipient of clauses like the above could figure out what the sentences mean from the sentences on either side or from the \"overall context\" or whatever. A listener can usually figure out what I really mean when I misuse infer for imply or say indicate for say, too. But many of these solecisms require at least a couple extra nanoseconds of cognitive effort, a kind of rapid sift-and-discard process, before the recipient gets it. Extra work. It's debatable just how much extra work, but it seems indisputable that we put some extra neural burden on the recipient when we fail to follow certain conventions. W/r/t confusing clauses like the above, it simply seems more \"considerate\" to follow the rules of correct SWE ... just as it's more \"considerate\" to de-slob your home before entertaining guests or to brush your teeth before picking up a date. Not just more considerate but more respectful somehow — both of your listener and of what you're trying to get across. As we sometimes also say about elements of fashion and etiquette, the way you use English \"Makes a Statement\" or \"Sends a Message\" — even though these Statements/Messages often have nothing to do with the actual information you're trying to transmit.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've now sort of bled into a more serious rejoinder to Philosophical Descriptivism: From the fact that linguistic communication is not strictly dependent on usage and grammar it does not necessarily follow that the traditional rules of usage and grammar are nothing but \"inconsequential decorations.\" Another way to state the objection is that just because something is \"decorative\" does not necessarily make it \"inconsequential.\" Rhetorically, Pinker's flip dismissal is bad tactics, for it invites the very question it begs: inconsequential to whom?\n",
      "\n",
      "Take, for example, the Descriptivism claim that so-called correct English usages such as brought rather than brung and felt rather than feeled are arbitrary and restrictive and unfair and are supported only by custom and are (like irregular verbs in general) archaic and incommodious and an all-around pain in the ass. Let us concede for the moment that these objections are 100 percent reasonable. Then let's talk about pants. Trousers, slacks. I suggest to you that having the \"correct\" subthoracic clothing for U.S. males be pants instead of skirts is arbitrary (lots of other cultures let men wear skirts), restrictive and unfair (U.S. females get to wear pants), based solely on archaic custom (I think it's got something to do with certain traditions about gender and leg position, the same reasons girls' bikes don't have a crossbar), and in certain ways not only incommodious but illogical (skirts are more comfortable than pants; pants ride up; pants are hot; pants can squish the genitals and reduce fertility; over time pants chafe and erode irregular sections of men's leg hair and give older men hideous half-denuded legs, etc. etc.). Let us grant — as a thought experiment if nothing else — that these are all reasonable and compelling objections to pants as an androsartorial norm. Let us in fact in our minds and hearts say yes — shout yes — to the skirt, the kilt, the toga, the sarong, the jupe. Let us dream of or even in our spare time work toward an America where nobody lays any arbitrary sumptuary prescriptions on anyone else and we can all go around as comfortable and aerated and unchafed and unsquished and motile as we want.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet the fact remains that, in the broad cultural mainstream of millennial America, men do not wear skirts. If you, the reader, are a U.S. male, and even if you share my personal objections to pants and dream as I do of a cool and genitally unsquishy American Tomorrow, the odds are still 99.9 percent that in 100 percent of public situations you wear pants/slacks/shorts/trunks. More to the point, if you are a U.S. male and also have a U.S. male child, and if that child were to come to you one evening and announce his desire/intention to wear a skirt rather than pants to school the next day, I am 100-percent confident that you are going to discourage him from doing so. Strongly discourage him. You could be a Molotov-tossing anti-pants radical or a kilt manufacturer or Steven Pinker himself — you're going to stand over your kid and be prescriptive about an arbitrary, archaic, uncomfortable, and inconsequentially decorative piece of clothing. Why? Well, because in modern America any little boy who comes to school in a skirt (even, say, a modest all-season midi) is going to get stared at and shunned and beaten up and called a Total Geekoid by a whole lot of people whose approval and acceptance are important to him.[26] In our culture, in other words, a boy who wears a skirt is Making a Statement that is going to have all kinds of gruesome social and emotional consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "You see where this is going. I'm going to describe the intended point of the pants analogy in terms I'm sure are simplistic — doubtless there are whole books in Pragmatics or psycholinguistics or something devoted to unpacking this point. The weird thing is that I've seen neither Descriptivists nor SNOTs deploy it in the Wars.[27]\n",
      "\n",
      "When I say or write something, there are actually a whole lot of different things I am communicating. The propositional content (the actual information I'm trying to convey) is only one part of it. Another part is stuff about me, the communicator. Everyone knows this. It's a function of the fact that there are uncountably many well-formed ways to say the same basic thing, from e.g. \"I was attacked by a bear!\" to \"Goddamn bear tried to kill me!\" to \"That ursine juggernaut bethought to sup upon my person!\" and so on. And different levels of diction and formality are only the simplest kinds of distinction; things get way more complicated in the sorts of interpersonal communication where social relations and feelings and moods come into play. Here's a familiar sort of example. Suppose that you and I are acquaintances and we're in my apartment having a conversation and that at some point I want to terminate the conversation and not have you be in my apartment anymore. Very delicate social moment. Think of all the different ways I can try to handle it: \"Wow, look at the time\"; \"Could we finish this up later?\"; \"Could you please leave now?\"; \"Go\"; \"Get out\"; \"Get the hell out of here\"; \"Didn't you say you had to be someplace?\"; \"Time for you to hit the dusty trail, my friend\"; \"Off you go then, love\"; or that sly old telephone-conversation ender: \"Well, I'm going to let you go now\"; etc. And then think of all the different factors and implications of each option.\n",
      "\n",
      "The point here is obvious. It concerns a phenomenon that SNOOTS blindly reinforce and that Descriptivists badly underestimate and that scary vocab-tape ads try to exploit. People really do \"judge\" one another according to their use of language. Constantly. Of course, people judge one another on the basis of all kinds of things — weight, scent, physiognomy, occupation, make of vehicle[28] — and, again, doubtless it's all terribly complicated and occupies whole battalions of sociolinguists. But it's clear that at least one component of all this interpersonal semantic judging involves acceptance, meaning not some touchy-feely emotional affirmation but actual acceptance or rejection of somebody's bid to be regarded as a peer, a member of somebody else's collective or community or Group. Another way to come at this is to acknowledge something that in the Usage Wars gets mentioned only in very abstract terms: \"Correct\" English usage is, as a practical matter, a function of whom you're talking to and how you want that person to respond — not just to your utterance but also to you. In other words, a large part of the agenda of any communication is rhetorical and depends on what some rhet-scholars call \"Audience\" or \"Discourse Community.\"[29] And the United States obviously has a huge number of such Discourse Communities, many of them regional and/or cultural dialects of English: Black English, Latino English, Rural Southern, Urban Southern, Standard Upper-Midwest, Maine Yankee, East-Texas Bayou, Boston BlueCollar, on and on. Everybody knows this. What not everyone knows — especially not certain Prescriptivists — is that many of these non-SWE dialects have their own highly developed and internally consistent grammars, and that some of these dialects' usage norms actually make more linguistic/aesthetic sense than do their Standard counterparts (see INTERPOLATION). Plus, of course, there are innumerable sub- and subsubdialects based on all sorts of things that have nothing to do with locale or ethnicity — Medical-School English, Peorians-Who-Follow-Pro-Wrestling-Closely English, Twelve-Year-Old-Males-Whose-Worldview-Is-Deeply-Informed-By-South-Park English — and that are nearly incomprehensible to anyone who isn't inside their very tight and specific Discourse Community (which of course is part of their function[30]).\n",

      "INTERPOLATION: EXAMPLE OF GRAMMATICAL ADVANTAGES OF A NON-STANDARD DIALECT THAT THIS REVIEWER ACTUALLY KNOWS ABOUT FIRSTHAND\n",
      "\n",
      "This rev. happens to have two native English dialects — the SWE of my hypereducated parents and the hard-earned Rural Midwestern of most of my peers. When I'm talking to R.M.'s, I usually use, for example, the construction \"Where's it at?\" instead of \"Where is it?\" Part of this is a naked desire to fit in and not get rejected as an egghead or fag (see sub). But another part is that I, SNOOT or no, believe that this and other R.M.isms are in certain ways superior to their Standard equivalents.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a dogmatic Prescriptivist, \"Where's it at?\" is double-damned as a sentence that not only ends with a preposition but whose final preposition forms a redundancy with where that's similar to the redundancy in \"the reason is because\" (which latter usage I'll admit makes me dig my nails into my palms). Rejoinder: First off, the avoid-terminal-prepositions rule is the invention of one Fr. R. Lowth, an eighteenth-century British preacher and indurate pedant who did things like spend scores of pages arguing for hath over the trendy and degenerate has. The a.-t.-p. rule is antiquated and stupid and only the most ayatolloid SNOOT takes it seriously. Garner himself calls the rule \"stuffy\" and lists all kinds of useful constructions like \"the man you were listening to\" that we'd have to discard or distort if we really enforced it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plus the apparent redundancy of \"Where's it at?\" [31] is offset by its metrical logic. What the at really does is license the contraction of is after the interrogative adverb. You can't say \"Where's it?\" So the choice is between \"Where is it?\" and \"Where's it at?\", and the latter, a strong anapest, is prettier and trips off the tongue better than \"Where is it?\", whose meter is either a clunky monosyllabic foot + trochee or it's nothing at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is probably the place for your SNOOT reviewer openly to concede that a certain number of traditional prescriptive rules really are stupid and that people who insist on them (like the legendary assistant to PM. Margaret Thatcher who refused to read any memo with a split infinitive in it, or the jr.-high teacher I had who automatically graded you down if you started a sentence with Hopefully) are that very most pathetic and dangerous sort of SNOOT, the SNOOT Who Is Wrong. The injunction against split infinitives, for instance, is a consequence of the weird fact that English grammar is modeled on Latin even though Latin is a synthetic language and English is an analytic language. [32] Latin infinitives consist of one word and are impossible to as it were split, and the earliest English Prescriptivists — so enthralled with Latin that their English usage guides were actually written in Latin [33] — decided that English infinitives shouldn't be split either. Garner himself takes out after the s.i. rule in both SPLIT INFINITIVES and SUPERSTITIONS. [34] And Hopefully at the beginning of a sentence, as a certain cheeky eighth-grader once pointed out to his everlasting social cost, actually functions not as a misplaced modal auxiliary or as a manner adverb like quickly or angrily but as a \"sentence adverb\" that indicates the speaker's attitude about the state of affairs described by the sentence (examples of perfectly OK sentence adverbs are Clearly, Basically, Luckily), and only SNOOTs educated in the high-pedantic years up to 1960 blindly proscribe it or grade it down.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cases of split infinitives and Hopefully are in fact often trotted out by dogmatic Descriptivists as evidence that all SWE usage rules are arbitrary and stupid (which is a bit like pointing to Pat Buchanan as evidence that all Republicans are maniacs). Garner rejects Hopefully's knee-jerk proscription, too, albeit grudgingly, including the adverb in his miniessay on SKUNKED TERMS, which is his phrase for a usage that is \"hotly disputed.., any use of it is likely to distract some readers.\" (Garner also points out something I'd never quite realized, which is that hopefully, if misplaced/mispunctuated in the body of a sentence, can create some of the same two-way ambiguities as other adverbs, as in the clause \"I will borrow your book and hopefully read it soon.\")\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether we're conscious of it or or, most of us are fluent in more than one major English dialect and in a large number of subdialects and are probably at least passable in countless others. Which dialect you choose to use depends, of course, on whom you're addressing. More to the point, I submit that the dialect you use depends mostly on what sort of Group your listener is part of and whether you wish to present yourself as a fellow member of that Group. An obvious example is that traditional upper-class English has certain dialectal differences from lower-class English and that schools used to have courses in Elocution whose whole point was to teach people how to speak in an upper-class way. But usage-as-inclusion is about much more than class. Here's another thought experiment: A bunch of U.S. teenagers in clothes that look far too large for them are sitting together in the local mall's Food Court, and a 53-year-old man with a combover and clothes that fit comes over to them and says that he was scoping them and thinks they're totally rad and/or phat and is it cool if he just kicks it and does the hang here with them. The kids' reaction is going to be either scorn or embarrassment for the guy — most likely a mix of both. Q: Why? Or imagine that two hard-core urban black guys are standing there talking and I, who am resoundingly and in all ways white, come up and greet them with \"Yo\" and call them \"Brothers\" and ask \"s'up, s'goin on,\" pronouncing on with that NYCish oo-o diphthong that Young Urban Black English deploys for a standard o. Either these guys are going to be offended or they are going to think I am simply out of my mind. No other reaction is remotely foreseeable. Q: Why?\n",
      "\n",
      "Why: A dialect of English is learned and used either because it's your native vernacular or because it's the dialect of a Group by which you wish (with some degree of plausibility) to be accepted. And although it is the major and arguably the most important one, SWE is only one dialect. And it is never, or at least hardly ever, anybody's only dialect. This is because there are — as you and I both know and yet no one in the Usage Wars ever seems to mention — situations in which faultlessly correct SWE is clearly not the appropriate dialect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Childhood is full of such situations. This is one reason why SNOOTlets tend to have a very hard social time of it in school. A SNOOTlet is a little kid who's wildly, precociously fluent in SWE (he is often, recall, the offspring of SNOOTs). Just about every class has a SNOOTlet, so I know you've seen them — these are the sorts of six- to twelve-year-olds who use whom correctly and whose response to striking out in T-ball is to cry out \"How incalculably dreadful!\" etc. The elementary-school SNOOTlet is one of the earliest identifiable species of academic Geekoid and is duly despised by his peers and praised by his teachers. These teachers usually don't see the incredible amounts of punishment the SNOOTlet is receiving from his classmates, or if they do see it they blame the classmates and shake their heads sadly at the vicious and arbitrary cruelty of which children are capable.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the other children's punishment of the SNOOTIet is not arbitrary at all. There are important things at stake. Little kids in school are learning about Group-inclusion and -exclusion and about the respective rewards and penalties of same and about the use of dialect and syntax and slang as signals of affinity and inclusion. [35] They're learning about Discourse Communities. Kids learn this stuff not in English or Social Studies but on the playground and at lunch and on the bus. When his peers are giving the SNOOTlet monstrous quadruple Wedgies or holding him down and taking turns spitting on him, there's serious learning going on ... for everyone except the little SNOOT, who in fact is being punished for precisely his failure to learn. What neither he nor his teacher realizes is that the SNOOTlet is deficient in Language Arts. He has only one dialect. He cannot alter his vocabulary, usage, or grammar, cannot use slang or vulgarity; and it's these abilities that are really required for \"peer rapport,\" which is just a fancy Elementary-Ed term for being accepted by the most important Group in the little kid's life.\n",
      "\n",
      "This reviewer acknowledges that there seems to be some, umm, personal stuff getting dredged up and worked out here;[36] but the stuff is relevant. The point is that the little A+ SNOOTlet is actually in the same dialectal position as the class's \"slow\" kid who can't learn to stop using ain't or bringed. One is punished in class, the other on the playground, but both are deficient in the same linguistic skill — viz., the ability to move between various dialects and levels of \"correctness,\" the ability to communicate one way with peers and another way with teachers and another with family and another with Little League coaches and so on. Most of these dialectal adjustments are made below the level of conscious awareness, and our ability to make them seems part psychological and part something else — perhaps something hardwired into the same motherboard as Universal Grammar — and in truth this ability is a far better indicator of a kid's \"Verbal I.Q.\" than test scores or grades, since U.S. English classes do far more to retard dialectal talent than to cultivate it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well-known fact: In neither K-12 or college English are systematic WE grammar and usage much taught anymore. It's been this way for more than 20 years. The phenomenon drives Prescriptivists nuts, and it's one of the big things they cite as evidence of America's gradual murder of English. Descriptivists and English-Ed specialists counter that grammar and usage have been abandoned because scientific research proved that studying SWE grammar and usage simply doesn't help make kids better writers. Each side in the debate tends to regard the other as mentally ill or/and blinded by political ideology. Neither camp appears ever to have considered whether maybe the way prescriptive SWE was traditionally taught had something to do with its inutility.\n",
      "\n",
      "By way here I'm referring not so much to actual method as to spirit or attitude. Most traditional teachers of English grammar have, of course, been dogmatic SNOOTs, and like most dogmatists they've been incredibly stupid about the rhetoric they used and the Audience they were addressing. [37] I refer specifically to their assumption that SWE is the sole appropriate English dialect and that the only reasons anyone could fail to see this are ignorance or amentia or grave deficiencies in character. As rhetoric, this sort of attitude works only in sermons to the Choir, and as pedagogy it's just disastrous. The reality is that an average U.S. student is going to go to the trouble of mastering the difficult conventions of SWE only if he sees SWE's relevant Group or Discourse Community as one he'd like to be part of. And in the absence of any sort of argument for why the correct-SWE Group is a good or desirable one (an argument that, recall, the traditional teacher hasn't given, because he's such a dogmatic SNOOT he sees no need to), the student is going to be reduced to evaluating the desirability of the SWE Group based on the one obvious member of the Group he's encountered, namely the SNOOTy teacher himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not suggesting here that an effective SWE pedagogy would require teachers to wear sunglasses and call students \"Dude.\" What I am suggesting is that the rhetorical situation of an English class — a class composed wholly of young people whose Group identity is rooted in defiance of Adult-Establishment values, plus also composed partly of minorities whose primary dialects are different from SWE — requires the teacher to come up with overt, honest, compelling arguments for why SWE is a dialect worth learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "These arguments are hard to make — not intellectually but emotionally, politically. Because they are baldly elitist. [38] The real truth, of course, is that SWE is the dialect of the American elite. That it was invented, codified, and promulgated by Privileged WASP Males and is perpetuated as \"Standard\" by same. That it is the shibboleth of the Establishment and an instrument of political power and class division and racial discrimination and all manner of social inequity. These are shall we say rather delicate subjects to bring up in an English class, especially in the service of a pro-SWE argument, and extra-especially if you yourself are both a Privileged WASP Male and the Teacher and thus pretty much a walking symbol of the Adult Establishment. This reviewer's opinion, though, is that both students and SWE are better served if the teacher makes his premises explicit, licit and his argument overt, presenting himself as an advocate of SWE's utility rather than as a prophet of its innate superiority.\n",

      "I should note here that a couple of the students I've said this stuff to were offended — one lodged an Official Complaint — and that I have had more than one colleague profess to find my spiel \"racially insensitive.\" Perhaps you do, too. My own humble opinion is that some of the cultural and political realities of American life are themselves racially insensitive and elitist and offensive and unfair, and that pussyfooting around these realities with euphemistic doublespeak is not only hypocritical but toxic to the project of ever actually changing them. Such pussyfooting has of course now achieved the status of a dialect — one powerful enough to have turned the normal politics of the Usage Wars sort of inside out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I refer here to Politically Correct English (PCE), under whose conventions failing students become \"high-potential\" students and poor people \"economically disadvantaged\" and people in wheelchairs \"differently abled\" and a sentence like \"White English and Black English are different and you better learn White English if you don't want to flunk\" is not blunt but \"insensitive.\" Although it's common to make jokes about PCE (referring to ugly people as \"aesthetically challenged\" and so on), be advised that Politically Correct English's various pre- and proscriptions are taken very seriously indeed by colleges and corporations and government agencies, whose own institutional dialects now evolve under the beady scrutiny of a whole new kind of Language Police.\n",
      "\n",
      "From one perspective, the history of PCE evinces a kind of Lenin-to-Stalinesque irony. That is, the same ideological principles that informed the original Descriptivist revolution — namely, the sixties-era rejections of traditional authority and traditional inequality — have now actually produced a far more inflexible Prescriptivism, one unencumbered by tradition or complexity and backed by the threat of real-world sanctions (termination, litigation) for those who fail to conform. This is sort of funny in a dark way, maybe, and most criticism of PCE seems to consist in making fun of its trendiness or vapidity. This reviewer's own opinion is that prescriptive PCE is not just silly but confused and dangerous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Usage is always political, of course, but it's complexly political. With respect, for instance, to political change, usage conventions can function in two ways: On the one hand they can be a reflection of political change, and on the other they can be an instrument of political change. These two functions are different and have to be kept straight. Confusing them — in particular, mistaking for political efficacy what is really just a language's political symbolism ... — enables the bizarre conviction that America ceases to be elitist or unfair simply because Americans stop using certain vocabulary that is historically associated with elitism and unfairness. This is PCE's central fallacy — that a society's mode of expression is productive of its attitudes rather than a product of those attitudes — and of course it's nothing but the obverse of the politically conservative SNOOT'S delusion that social change can be retarded by restricting change in standard usage. [40]\n",
      "\n",
      "Forget Stalinization or Logic 101-level equivocations, though. There's a grosser irony about Politically Correct English. This is that PCE purports to be the dialect of progressive reform but is in fact — in its Orwellian substitution of the euphemisms of social equality for social equality itself — of vastly more help to conservatives and the U.S. status quo than traditional SNOOT prescriptions ever were. Were I, for instance, a political conservative who opposed taxation as a means of redistributing national wealth, I would be delighted to watch PCE progressives spend their time and energy arguing over whether a poor person should be described as \"low-income\" or \"economically disadvantaged\" or \"pre-prosperous\" rather than constructing effective public arguments for redistributive legislation or higher marginal tax rates on corporations. (Not to mention that strict codes of egalitarian euphemism serve to burke the sorts of painful, unpretty, and sometimes offensive discourse that in a pluralistic democracy leads to actual political change rather than symbolic political change. In other words, PCE functions as a form of censorship, and censorship always serves the status quo.)\n",
      "\n",
      "As a practical matter, I strongly doubt whether a guy who has four small kids and makes $12,000 a year feels more empowered or less ill-used by a society that carefully refers to him as \"economically disadvantaged\" rather than \"poor.\" Were I he, in fact, I'd probably find the PCE term insulting — not just because it's patronizing but because it's hypocritical and self-serving. Like many forms of Vogue Usage,[41] PCE functions primarily to signal and congratulate certain virtues in the speaker — scrupulous egalitarianism, concern for the dignity of all people, sophistication about the political implications of language — and so serves the selfish interests of the PC far more than it serves any of the persons or groups renamed.\n",

Orwell, who 50 years ago had AE pegged as a \"mixture of vagueness and sheer incompetence\" in which \"it is normal to come across long passages which are almost completely lacking in meaning.\"[43]\n",
      "\n",
      "It probably isn't the whole explanation, but, as with the voguish hypocrisy of PCE, the obscurity and pretension of Academic English can be attributed in part to a disruption in the delicate rhetorical balance between language as a vector of meaning and language as a vector of the writer's own resume. In other words, it is when a scholar's vanity/insecurity leads him to write primarily to communicate and reinforce his own status as an Intellectual that his English is deformed by pleonasm and pretentious diction (whose function is to signal the writer's erudition) and by opaque abstraction (whose function is to keep anybody from pinning the writer down to a definite assertion that can maybe be refuted or shown to be silly). The latter characteristic, a level of obscurity that often makes it just about impossible to figure out what an AE sentence is really saying, so closely resembles political and corporate doublespeak (\"revenue enhancement,\" \"downsizing,\" pre-owned,\" \"proactive resource-allocation restructuring\") that it's tempting to think AE's real purpose is concealment and its real motivation fear.\n",

Blame it on Heisenbergian Uncertainty or postmodern relativism or Image Over Substance or the ubiquity of advertising and P.R. or the rise of Identity Politics or whatever you will — we live in an era of terrible preoccupation with presentation and interpretation. In rhetorical terms, certain long-held distinctions between the Ethical Appeal, Logical Appeal (= an argument's plausibility or soundness), and Pathetic Appeal (= an argument's emotional impact) have now pretty much collapsed — or rather the different sorts of Appeals now affect and are affected by one another in ways that make it almost impossible to advance an argument on \"reason\" alone.\n",

      "A vividly concrete illustration here concerns the Official Complaint a black undergraduate filed against this rev. after one of my little in camera spiels described on pages 53-54. The complainant was (I opine) wrong, but she was not crazy or stupid; and I was able later to see that I did bear some responsibility for the whole nasty administrative swivet. My culpability lay in gross rhetorical naivete. I'd seen my speech's primary Appeal as Logical: The aim was to make a conspicuously blunt, honest argument for SWE's utility. It wasn't pretty, maybe, but it was true, plus so manifestly bullshit-free that I think I anticipated not just acquiescence but gratitude for my candor. [44] The problem I failed to see, of course, lay not with the argument per se but with the person making it — namely me, a Privileged WASP Male in a position of power, thus someone whose statements about the primacy and utility of the Privileged WASP Male dialect appeared not candid/hortatory/ authoritative/true but elitist/high-handed/ authoritarian/racist. Rhetoric-wise what happened was that I allowed the substance and style of my Logical Appeal to completely torpedo my Ethical Appeal: What the student heard was just another PWM rationalizing why his Group and his English were top dog and ought \"logically\" to stay that way (plus, worse, trying to use his academic power over her to coerce her assent [45] ).\n",

      "ARTICLE'S CRUX: WHY BRYAN A. GARNER IS A GENIUS, THOUGH OF A RATHER PARTICULAR KIND\n",
      "\n",
      "It isn't that A Dictionary of Modern American Usage is perfect It doesn't seem to cover conversant in vs. conversant with, for example, or abstruse vs. obtuse, or to have anything on hereby and herewith (which I tend to use interchangeably but always have the uneasy feeling I'm screwing up). Garner's got a good discussion of used to but nothing on supposed to. Nor does he give any examples to help explain irregular participles and transitivity (\"The light shone\" vs. \"I shined the light,\" etc.), and these would seem to be more important than, say, the correct spelling of huzzah or the plural of animalculum, both of which get discussed. Plus there's the VOGUE WORDS snafu and the absence of a pronunciation entry on trough. [47] In other words, a SNOOT is going to be able to find stuff to quibble about in any usage dictionary, and ADMAU is no exception.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it's still really, really good — and not just lexicographically but rhetorically, politically (if it even makes sense to distinguish these any more). As a collection of judgments, ADMAU is in no way Descriptivist, but Garner structures his judgments very carefully to avoid the elitism and anality of traditional SNOGTitude. He does not deploy irony or scorn or caustic wit, nor tropes or colloquialisms or contractions ... or really any sort of verbal style at all. In fact, even though Garner talks openly about himself and uses the 1-S pronoun throughout the whole dictionary, his personality is oddly effaced, neutralized. It's like he's so bland he's barely there. E.g., as this reviewer was finishing the book's final entry,[48] it struck me that I had no idea whether Bryan Garner was black or white, gay or straight, Democrat or Dittohead. What was even more striking was that I hadn't once wondered about any of this up to now; something about Garner's lexical persona kept me ever from asking where the guy was coming from or what particular agendas or ideologies were informing what he had admitted right up front were \"value judgments.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bryan Garner is a genius because the Dictionary of Modern American Usage pretty much resolves the Usage Wars' Crisis of Authority. Garner manages to control the compresence of rhetorical Appeals so cleverly that he appears able to transcend both Usage Wars camps and simply tell the truth, and in a way that does not torpedo his own credibility but actually enhances it. His argumentative strategy is totally brilliant and totally sneaky, and part of both qualities is that it usually doesn't seem like there's even an argument going on at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Garner recognizes something that neither of the dogmatic camps appears to get: Given 40 years of the Usage Wars, \"authority\" is no longer something a lexicographer can just presume ex officio. In fact, a large part of the project of any contemporary usage dictionary will consist in establishing this authority. If that seems rather obvious, be apprised that nobody before Garner seems to have figured it out — that the lexicographer's challenge now is to be not just accurate and comprehensive but credible. That in the absence of unquestioned Authority in language, the reader must now be moved or persuaded to grant a dictionary its authority, freely and for what appear to be good reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Garner's A Dictionary of Modern American Usage is thus both a collection of information and a piece of Democratic rhetoric.[49] Its goal is to recast the Prescriptivist's persona: The author presents himself as an authority not in an autocratic sense but in a technocratic sense. And the technocrat is not only a thoroughly modern and palatable image of Authority but also immune to the charges of elitism/classism that have hobbled traditional Prescriptivism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, Garner really is a technocrat. He's a lawyer, recall, and in ADMAU he consciously projects a sort of wise juridical persona: knowledgeable, dispassionate, fair, with an almost Enlightenment-grade passion for reason. His judgments about usage tend to be rendered like legal opinions — exhaustive citation of precedent (other dictionaries' judgments, published examples of actual usage) combined with clear, logical reasoning that's always informed by the larger consensual purposes SWE is meant to serve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also thoroughgoingly technocratic is Garner's approach to the issue of whether anybody's even going to be interested in his 700 pages of fine-pointed counsel. Like any specialist, he simply presumes that there are practical reasons why some people choose to concern themselves with SWE usage; and his attitude about the fact that most Americans \"could care less\" isn't scorn or disapproval but the phlegmatic resignation of a doctor or lawyer who realizes that he can give good advice but can't make you take it:\n",

      "\n",
      "It's now possible to see that all the autobiographical stuff in ADMAU's Preface does more than just humanize Mr. Bryan A. Garner. It also serves to detail the early and enduring passion that helps make someone a credible technocrat — we tend to like and trust experts whose expertise is born of a real love for their specialty instead of just a desire to be expert at something. In fact, it turns out that ADMAU's Preface quietly and steadily invests Garner with every single qualification of modern technocratic Authority: passionate devotion, reason, and accountability (recall \"in the interests of full disclosure, here are the ten critical points ...\"), experience (\"that, after years of working on usage problems, I've settled on\"), exhaustive and tech-savvy research (\"For contemporary usage, the files of our greatest dictionary makers pale in comparison with the fulltext search capabilities now provided by NEXIS and WESTLAW\"), an even and judicious temperament (see e.g. this from HYPERCORRECTION: \"Sometimes people strive to abide by the strictest etiquette, but in the process behave inappropriately\" [52] ), and the sort of humble integrity (for instance, including in one of the entries a past published usage-error of his own) that not only renders Garner likable but transmits the same kind of reverence for English that good jurists have for the law, both of which are bigger and more important than any one person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Probably the most attractive thing about ADMAU's Ethical Appeal, though, is Garner's scrupulous consideration of the reader's concern about his (or her) own linguistic authority and rhetorical persona and ability to convince an Audience that he cares. Again and again, Garner frames his prescriptions in rhetorical terms, e.g.: \"To the writer or speaker for whom credibility is important, it's a good idea to avoid distracting any readers or listeners.\" Dictionary of Modern American Usage's real thesis, in other words, is that the purposes of the expert authority and the purposes of the lay reader are identical, and identically rhetorical — which I submit is about as Democratic these days as you're going to get.\n",

This happens to be one of those very rare times when \"historical context\" is the phrase to use and there is no equivalent phrase that isn't even worse.

SNOOT (n) (highly colloq) is this reviewer's nuclear family's nickname a clef for a really extreme usage fanatic, the sort of person whose idea of Sunday fun is to look for mistakes in Safire's column's prose itself. This reviewer's family is roughly 70 percent SNOOT, which term itself derives from an acronym, with the big historical family joke being that whether S.N.O.O.T. stood for \"Sprachgefuhl Necessitates Our Ongoing Tendance\" or \"Syntax Nudniks of Our Time\" depended on whether or not you were one.\n",

But I am also so pathologically anal about(*) usage that every semester the same thing happens: The minute I have read my students' first set of papers, we immediately abandon the regular Lit syllabus and have a three-week Emergency Remedial Usage Unit, during which my demeanor is basically that of somebody teaching HIV prevention to intravenous-drug users. When it emerges (as it does, every time) that 95 percent of these intelligent upscale college students have never been taught, e.g., what a clause is or why a misplaced \"only\" can make a sentence confusing, I all but pound my head on the blackboard; I exhort them to sue their hometown school boards.

Please note that the strategically repeated 1-P pronoun is meant to iterate and emphasize that this reviewer is very much one too, a SNOOT, plus to connote the nuclear family mentioned supra.

In ADMAU's Preface, Bryan Garner mentions both his father and grandfather and actually uses the word genetic, and it's probably true: 95 percent of the SNOOTs I know have at least one parent who is, by profession or temperament or both, a SNOOT. In my own case, my mom is a Comp teacher and has written remedial usage books and is a SNOOT of the most rabid and intractable sort. At least part of the reason I am a SNOOT is that for years Mom brainwashed us in all sorts of subtle ways. Here's an example. Family suppers often involved a game: If one of us children made a usage error. Mom would pretend to have a coughing fit that would go on and on until the relevant child had identified the relevant error and corrected it. It was all very self-ironic and lighthearted; but still, looking back, it seems a bit excessive to pretend that your child is actually denying you oxygen by speaking incorrectly. But the really chilling thing is that I now sometimes find myself playing this same \"game\" with my own students, complete with pretend pertussion.\n",

Many of us are prone to lay-philosophising about the weird privacy of our own mental states, for example, and from the fact that when my knee hurts only I can feel it, it's tempting to conclude that for me the word pain has a very subjective internal meaning that only I can truly understand. This line of thinking is sort of like the adolescent pot-smoker's terror that his own inner experience is both private and unverifiable, a syndrome that is techinically known as Cannabalic Solipsism. Eating ChipsAhoy! and staring very intently at the television's network PGA event, for instance, the adolescent potsmoker is struck by ghastly possibility that, e.g., what he sees as the color green and what other people call \"the color green\" may in fact not be the same color experiences at all The fact that both he and someone else call Pebble Beach's fairways green and a stoplight's GO signal green appears to guarantee only that there is a similar consistency in their color experience of fairways and GO lights, not that the actual subjective quality of those color experiences is the same; it could be that what the ad. pot-smoker experiences as green everyone else actually experiences as blue, and what we \"mean\" by the Word blue is what he \"means\" by green, etc., etc., until the Whole line of thinking gets so vexed and exhausting that the a.p.-s, ends up slumped crumb-strewn and paralyzed in his chair.\n",

Because they're kids and it's school, the obvious Them is the teachers and all the values and appurtenances of the teacher world.

The real problem is that every sentence blends and balances at least two different communicative functions — one the transmission of raw info, the other the transmission of certain stuff about the speaker — and Vogue Usage throws this balance off. Garher's \"serve little purpose\" is exactly incorrect; vogue words serve too much the purpose of presenting the speaker in a certain light (even if this is merely as with-it or hip), and people's subliminal B.S.-antennae pick this imbalance up, and that's why even nonSNOOTs often find Vogue Usage irritating and creepy.\n",

His overall verdict on s.i.'s — which is that some are \"perfectly proper\" and some iffy and some just totally bad news, and that no one wide tidy dogmatic ukase[???] can handle all s.i. cases, and thus that \"knowing when to split an infinitive requires a good ear and a keen eye\" — is a good example of the way Garner distinguishes sound and helpful Descriptivist objections from wacko or dogmatic objections and then incorporates the sound objections into a smarter and more flexible Prescriptivism.\n",

They are, in other words, starting to learn about Us and Them, and about how an Us always needs a Them because being not-Them is essential to being Us. Because they're kids and it's school, the obvious Them is the teachers and all the values and appurtenances of the teacher world. This teacher-Them helps the kids see how to start to be an Us, but the SNOOTlet completes the puzzle by providing the as it were missing link: He is the Traitor, the Us who is in fact not Us but Them.\n",

A Dictionary of Modern American Usage includes a miniessay on VOGUE WORDS, but it's a disappointing one in that Garner does little more than list VW's that bug him and say that \"vogue words have such a grip on the popular mind that they come to be used in contexts in which they serve little purpose.\" This is one of the rare places in ADMAU where Garner is simply wrong. The real problem is that every sentence blends and balances at least two different communicative functions — one the transmission of raw info, the other the transmission of certain stuff about the speaker — and Vogue Usage throws this balance off. Garher's \"serve little purpose\" is exactly incorrect; vogue words serve too much the purpose of presenting the speaker in a certain light (even if this is merely as with-it or hip), and people's subliminal B.S.-antennae pick this imbalance up, and that's why even nonSNOOTs often find Vogue Usage irritating and creepy.\n",

      "But my plans changed once I got inside. Billy always kept the Mini-14 where he could see it. At the time, he was in his S&M torture chamber through a door at the back of his office. So I picked up the gun where he'd left it on his desk, sat down, and waited for him.\n",

      "\n",
      "But when I looked to see what had happened, Billy was still sitting in his chair, smiling. I studied the smoking barrel of the gun. At the end of it, one of those party favor flags had shot out with a word written in a comic font: BANG!\n",
      "\n",
      "Billy stood up, and I felt invisible ropes surround me. The Mini-14 dropped out of my hands. He advanced with the bowie knife. I remembered what happened to Cory and said another silent prayer, hoping it would be quick and painless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Out of the S&M torture chamber behind Billy, a bunch of the beautiful creatures walked out, drawn by the sound of the gunshot. Lily was with them. They were naked, their hair sussed. Lily looked more beautiful than ever –– small breasts, big hips, skin so clear it looked like a doll's. Her robin's egg blue nails stood out in the dimness of Billy's office.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Baby!\" Lily said, rushing over to me. \"Your tattoos!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I looked down and noticed that two holes had burned through my shirt. The thread was incinerating, sizzling away like a wheat field on fire. The pentagram's outline was burning, as was the mark of the beast –– the ram's head with the script underneath, which read Billy's Goat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Help me!\" I screamed. The pain was excruciating. \"Please! Lily, he's going to destroy the world! He's evil, don't you see that? But we can stand for good––you have to help me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You and your Manichaeism,\" said Billy. \"Light and dark, good and evil. There ain't no God. And if there was, he sure as hell wouldn't bust his ass helping the likes of you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He walked over to Lily, smacking her naked butt with a hand that had turned definitively into a monster's claw. He bit into Lily's shoulder, drawing blood. Then he looked back at me with reddened fangs that seemed to be growing by the second.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please don't kill me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I ain't gonna kill you,\" said Billy. \"I want you to spread the message.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spread your message? What do you mean?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Warn 'em of my coming,\" said Billy. His harem of concubines and acolytes walked alongside him over to me. \"Write about this. Pique the interest of the ones drawn to the darkness. And the others –– well, they're not gonna believe a goddamn word you say. You already sound like a fucking crazy person.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I ––\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At the moment, invisible stitches ran through my lips, cinching them shut. My hands were bound to my side. I struggled, wanting to reach up, get a finger between my lips so I could pry them open. But I was paralyzed. A needle that wasn't there continued its work, diving in and out of the flesh and making me wish I'd used the Mini-14 on myself. I had a feeling it would have been a bullet if the barrel was turned in the opposite direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can't speak of it,\" said Billy. \"But after I untether your ropes, your fingers will still move. Type to your little heart's content.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He stood in front of me, toe-to-toe. In his eyes, I saw something that I'd never scratched the surface of until then. There was a void. A complete and utter void of anything –– no compassion, no hatred, nothing. A lack –– consummate darkness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I looked into the future,\" Billy said. \"Fucking Coronavirus. Creation Fest is gonna be canceled this year.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He reached down and took my phone out of the pocket of my jeans.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But this is your sword, kid,\" he said. \"Wield it mightily. Spread the word about me and see if one God-loving person believes you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In his eyes, I saw that the void filled. I witnessed the fury of hell. Slaves, toiling amidst sweltering flames. There was a sense of humor at it all. Those who'd accepted their Generalships, *Billy's Goats,* stood on top of the rubble and laughed at the cosmic joke of human existence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As I looked into the future,\" continued Billy, \"I came to realize that 2020 will be the year of bizarre shit. But an antichrist Christian country music singer who's planning to bring about hell on Earth? Come on now, kid. It'll be a good story; gear the few who read it up for the possibility. I like it when they run scared.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I looked down to realize that my shirt had sizzled away completely. The fire outlining my tattoos had smoldered, leaving blackened scars behind. Lily came forward and touched them, but there was nothing gentle in her touch, now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lily's robin's egg nails had turned into blackened claws. I saw that she was no longer blond, either, no longer tan-skinned and big hipped. She had dark gray features, skinny as a pole. Her hair had fallen out, revealing an oozing, sore-covered scalp beneath.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I told you I could be whatever you want me to be, didn't I?\" she asked. \"Didn't mean you saw who I really was.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She was a walking corpse. And she was a living nest for black widows. They began clawing out of her pores and tumbling out of her gaping mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you fret, baby,\" she mumbled, her word muffled by the bodies of a thousand widows crawling up from inside her chest. \"You're going to sleep now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lily raised her index finger and dug a claw into my head, right between the eyes. She traced a symbol, the pain worse than any I'd ever felt. As my consciousness began to fade, and I fell to the floor, I looked up to see Billy standing over me –– the Devil incarnate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Too bad, kid. You'd have made one hell of a shepherd.\"\n",

      "\\*\\*\\*\n",
      "\n",
      "I woke up hours later in a field, freezing half to death. A farmer found me. He took me inside and gave me clothes, but when he saw the symbols on my chest and the symbol on my forehead, he told me to get the hell out of his house.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the way out, I looked in the mirror. Lily had carved something between my eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a blackened, upside-down cross, just like the one that had been bolted to the ceiling above the bed on the night of our unholy marriage.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Fast forward to a little under a year later. I'm mute now. The invisible stitches are still there, in a strange way –– my lips move, but when I try to talk, no words come out. I can type, though. My phone is my sword, but I'm nothing more than a pathetic, crazed crusader –– one of the outcasts who Jesus would have shown compassion to.\n",

      "\n",
      "Billy played it well. I can't talk. I can only gesture around like a crazy person. I have an upside-down cross scared into my forehead. Lift my shirt, and you'll see blackened scars — a pentagram on one side, a ram's head on the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who the hell would believe a word I say? Maybe a few, but those are the ones Billy wants to know –– the crazy ones, like me, or the ones who seek darkness, who'd gladly join his army if they knew he was creating one.\n",

    "#sample = ['Winter grew up in Hyde Park, NY and graduated from Franklin Delano Roosevelt High School in 1992, where he was a member of the varsity soccer and rowing teams.[1] While in high school, he also represented the Hudson Valley in rowing in the Empire State Games.[2] Upon graduation, he enrolled at Boston University where he was first introduced to rugby after failing to make the rowing team. At B.U., he was also a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity,[3] but transferred to SUNY New Paltz after one year. There, he played rugby for the newly promoted Hawks in their first ever season in Division 1 in 1993 up until their playoff run in 1996. He then attended Northeastern University, playing rugby for the NU \"Maddogs\" throughout the remainder of his college career until his graduation in 1999.[4] After college, Winter played briefly with Clontarf Rugby in Dublin, Ireland, making just a handful of appearances as a utility forward with their junior sides before the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak halted the majority of the 2001 rugby season. Following the lifting of the travel ban, Winter joined Bus Éireann RFC in the Leinster junior league for the remainder of their season.']\n",
